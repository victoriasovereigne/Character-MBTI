<p/>BOOK FIRST: THE PRINCE




<p/>PART FIRST

<p/>I

<p/>The Prince had always liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) London, when it had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was
one of the modern Romans who find by the Thames a more convincing image
of the truth of the ancient state than any they have left by the Tiber.
Brought up on the legend of the City to which the world paid tribute, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
recognised in the present London much more than in contemporary Rome the
real dimensions of such a case. If it was a question of an Imperium, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
said to himself, and if one wished, as a Roman, to recover a little the
sense of that, the place to do so was on London Bridge, or even, on a
fine afternoon in May, at Hyde Park Corner. It was not indeed to either
of those places that these grounds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) predilection, after all
sufficiently vague, had, at the moment we are concerned with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>), guided
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) steps; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) had strayed, simply enough, into Bond Street, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>)
imagination, working at comparatively short range, caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) now and
then to stop before a window in which objects massive and lumpish, in
silver and gold, in the forms to which precious stones contribute, or
in leather, steel, brass, applied to a hundred uses and abuses, were as
tumbled together as if, in the insolence of the Empire, they had been
the loot of far-off victories. The young man's movements, however,
betrayed no consistency of attention--not even, for that matter, when
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrests had proceeded from possibilities in faces shaded,
as they passed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the pavement, by huge beribboned hats, or more
delicately tinted still under the tense silk of parasols held at
perverse angles in waiting victorias. And the Prince's undirected
thought was not a little symptomatic, since, though the turn of
the season had come and the flush of the streets begun to fade, the
possibilities of faces, on the August afternoon, were still one of the
notes of the scene. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was too restless--that was the fact--for any
concentration, and the last idea that would just now have occurred to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in any connection was the idea of pursuit.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had been pursuing for six months as never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) life before, and
what had actually unsteadied him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), as we join him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), was the sense of how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had been justified. Capture had crowned the pursuit--or success,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would otherwise have put it, had rewarded virtue; whereby the
consciousness of these things made him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), for the hour, rather serious
than gay. A sobriety that might have consorted with failure sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
handsome face, constructively regular and grave, yet at the same time
oddly and, as might be, functionally almost radiant, with its dark
blue eyes, its dark brown moustache and its expression no more sharply
<div class="bookquote">``foreign''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to an English view than to have caused it sometimes to be
observed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) with a shallow felicity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked like a <div class="bookquote">``refined''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Irishman. What had happened was that shortly before, at three o’clock,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) fate had practically been sealed, and that even when one pretended
to no quarrel with it the moment had something of the grimness of a
crunched key in the strongest lock that could be made. There was nothing
to do as yet, further, but feel what one had done, and our personage
felt it while he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) aimlessly wandered. It was already as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) were
married, so definitely had the solicitors, at three o’clock, enabled the
date to be fixed, and by so few days was that date now distant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was
to dine at half-past eight o’clock with the young lady on whose behalf,
and on whose father's, the London lawyers had reached an inspired
harmony with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own man of business, poor Calderoni, fresh from Rome
and now apparently in the wondrous situation of being <div class="bookquote">``shown London,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Calderoni</b></font>)</div>before promptly leaving it again, by Mr. Verver himself, Mr. Verver
whose easy way with his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) millions had taxed to such small purpose, in the
arrangements, the principle of reciprocity. The reciprocity with which
the Prince was during these minutes most struck was that of Calderoni's
bestowal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Calderoni</b></font>) company for a view of the lions. If there was one thing
in the world the young man, at this juncture, clearly intended, it was
to be much more decent as a son-in-law than lots of fellows he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) could
think of had shown themselves in that character. He (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) thought of these
fellows, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) was so to differ, in English; he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) used, mentally,
the English term to describe his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) difference, for, familiar with the
tongue from his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) earliest years, so that no note of strangeness remained
with him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) either for lip or for ear, he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) found it convenient, in life, for
the greatest number of relations. He (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) found it convenient, oddly, even
for his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) relation with himself--though not unmindful that there might
still, as time went on, be others, including a more intimate degree of
that one, that would seek, possibly with violence, the larger or the
finer issue--which was it?--of the vernacular. Miss Verver had told him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) spoke English too well--it was his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) only fault, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) had not been
able to speak worse even to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``When I speak worse, you see,
I speak French,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) had said; intimating thus that there were
discriminations, doubtless of the invidious kind, for which that
language was the most apt. The girl had taken this, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) know,
as a reflection on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own French, which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had always so dreamed of
making good, of making better; to say nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) evident feeling
that the idiom supposed a cleverness she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not a person to rise to.
The Prince's answer to such remarks--genial, charming, like every answer
the parties to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) new arrangement had yet had from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was
practising his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) American in order to converse properly, on equal terms as
it were, with Mr. Verver. His (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) prospective father-in-law had a command of
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) said, that put him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) at a disadvantage in any discussion; besides
which--well, besides which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had made to the girl the observation that
positively, of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) observations yet, had most finely touched her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I think he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s a REAL galantuomo--`and no mistake.' There are
plenty of sham ones about. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seems to me simply the best man I've ever
seen in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) be?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl had gaily inquired.

<p/>It was this, precisely, that had set the Prince to think. The things, or
many of them, that had made Mr. Verver what he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was seemed practically
to bring a charge of waste against the other things that, with the other
people known to the young man, had failed of such a result. ``Why, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
`form,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had returned, <div class="bookquote">``might have made one doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father's form?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hadn't seen it. <div class="bookquote">``It strikes me he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hasn't got any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hasn't got mine--he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hasn't even got yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you for `even'!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl had laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yours, my
dear, is tremendous. But your father has his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own. I've made that out. So
don't doubt it. It's where it has brought him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out--that's the point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) goodness that has brought him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out,''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>our young woman had, at
this, objected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, darling, goodness, I think, never brought anyone out. Goodness,
when it's real, precisely, rather keeps people in.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been
interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discrimination, which amused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No, it's his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) WAY.
It belongs to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had wondered still. <div class="bookquote">``It's the American way. That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly--it's all. It's all, I say! It fits him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--so it must be good for
something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think it would be good for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie Verver had smilingly
asked.

<p/>To which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reply had been just of the happiest. <div class="bookquote">``I don't feel, my
dear, if you really want to know, that anything much can now either hurt
me or help me. Such as I am--but you'll see for yourself. Say, however,
I am a galantuomo--which I devoutly hope: I'm like a chicken, at best,
chopped up and smothered in sauce; cooked down as a creme de volaille,
with half the parts left out. Your father's the natural fowl running
about the bassecour. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feathers, movements, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sounds--those are the
parts that, with me, are left out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All, as a matter of course--since you can't eat a chicken alive!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince had not been annoyed at this, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had been positive.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm eating your father alive--which is the only way to taste him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
I want to continue, and as it's when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) talks American that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is most
alive, so I must also cultivate it, to get my pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) couldn't make
one like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so much in any other language.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>It mattered little that the girl had continued to demur--it was the mere
play of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) joy. <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could make you like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in Chinese.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be an unnecessary trouble. What I mean is that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s a kind
of result of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) inevitable tone. My liking is accordingly FOR the
tone--which has made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you'll hear enough of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``before you've done with
us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Only this, in truth, had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) frown a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, please, by my having `done' with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, found out about us all there is to find.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had been able to take it indeed easily as a joke. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, love, I
began with that. I know enough, I feel, never to be surprised. It's you
yourselves meanwhile,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``who really know nothing. There are
two parts of me'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had been moved to go on. <div class="bookquote">``One is made up of
the history, the doings, the marriages, the crimes, the follies, the
boundless betises of other people--especially of their infamous waste
of money that might have come to me. Those things are written--literally
in rows of volumes, in libraries; are as public as they're abominable.
Everybody can get at them, and you've, both of you, wonderfully, looked
them in the face. But there's another part, very much smaller
doubtless, which, such as it is, represents my single self, the unknown,
unimportant, unimportant--unimportant save to YOU--personal quantity.
About this you've found out nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Luckily, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl had bravely said; <div class="bookquote">``for what then would
become, please, of the promised occupation of my future?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man remembered even now how extraordinarily CLEAR--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't
call it anything else--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had looked, in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) prettiness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
said it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also remembered what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been moved to reply. <div class="bookquote">``The
happiest reigns, we are taught, you know, are the reigns without any
history.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not afraid of history!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been sure of that. <div class="bookquote">``Call it the
bad part, if you like--yours certainly sticks out of you. What was it
else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie Verver had also said, <div class="bookquote">``that made me originally think of
you? It wasn't--as I should suppose you must have seen--what you call
your unknown quantity, your particular self. It was the generations
behind you, the follies and the crimes, the plunder and the waste--the
wicked Pope, the monster most of all, whom so many of the volumes in
your family library are all about. If I've read but two or three yet, I
shall give myself up but the more--as soon as I have time--to the rest.
Where, therefore'' (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had put it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again--<div class="bookquote">``without your archives,
annals, infamies, would you have been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recalled what, to this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gravely returned. <div class="bookquote">``I might have been
in a somewhat better pecuniary situation.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) actual situation
under the head in question positively so little mattered to them that,
having by that time lived deep into the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advantage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
kept no impression of the girl's rejoinder. It had but sweetened the
waters in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now floated, tinted them as by the action of
some essence, poured from a gold-topped phial, for making one's bath
aromatic. No one before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), never--not even the infamous Pope--had
so sat up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) neck in such a bath. It showed, for that matter, how
little one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) race could escape, after all, from history. What was
it but history, and of THEIR kind very much, to have the assurance of
the enjoyment of more money than the palace-builder himself could have
dreamed of? This was the element that bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) up and into which Maggie
scattered, on occasion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) exquisite colouring drops. They were of the
colour--of what on earth? of what but the extraordinary American good
faith? They were of the colour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) innocence, and yet at the same
time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagination, with which their relation, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) and these
people's, was all suffused. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had further said on the occasion of
which we thus represent him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) as catching the echoes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) own thoughts
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) loitered--what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had further said came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>), for it had
been the voice itself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) luck, the soothing sound that was always
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You Americans are almost incredibly romantic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we are. That's just what makes everything so nice for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had wondered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, everything that's nice at all. The world, the beautiful,
world--or everything in it that is beautiful. I mean we see so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a moment--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) well knew how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>),
in respect to the beautiful world, as one of the beautiful, the
most beautiful things. But what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had answered was: <div class="bookquote">``You see too
much--that's what may sometimes make you difficulties. When you don't,
at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had amended with a further thought, <div class="bookquote">``see too little.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had quite granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) meant, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) warning
perhaps was needless.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had seen the follies of the romantic disposition, but there seemed
somehow no follies in theirs--nothing, one was obliged to recognise, but
innocent pleasures, pleasures without penalties. Their enjoyment was
a tribute to others without being a loss to themselves. Only the funny
thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had respectfully submitted, was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, though older
and wiser, and a man into the bargain, was as bad--that is as good--as
herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s better,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl had freely declared <div class="bookquote">``that is he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s worse.
His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) relation to the things he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cares for--and I think it beautiful--is
absolutely romantic. So is his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) whole life over here--it's the most
romantic thing I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) idea for his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) native place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--the collection, the Museum with which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wishes to endow it, and
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thinks more, as you know, than of anything in the world.
It's the work of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) life and the motive of everything he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) actual mood, could have smiled again--smiled
delicately, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had then smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Has it been his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) motive in
letting me have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, positively--or in a manner,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``American City isn't, by the way, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) native town, for, though he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s not
old, it's a young thing compared with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--a younger one. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) started
there, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has a feeling about it, and the place has grown, as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) says,
like the programme of a charity performance. You're at any rate a part
of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) collection,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had explained--<div class="bookquote">``one of the things that can only
be got over here. You're a rarity, an object of beauty, an object of
price. You're not perhaps absolutely unique, but you're so curious and
eminent that there are very few others like you--you belong to a class
about which everything is known. You're what they call a morceau de
musee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. I have the great sign of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had risked--<div class="bookquote">``that I cost a lot
of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had gravely answered, <div class="bookquote">``what you
cost'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had quite adored, for the moment, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way of saying it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had felt even, for the moment, vulgar. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made the best of that.
<div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you find out if it were a question of parting with me? My
value would in that case be estimated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) charming eyes, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) value were well
before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you mean that I'd pay rather than lose you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And then there came again what this had made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say. <div class="bookquote">``Don't talk about
ME--it's you who are not of this age. You're a creature of a braver and
finer one, and the cinquecento, at its most golden hour, wouldn't have
been ashamed of you. It would of me, and if I didn't know some of the
pieces your father has acquired, I should rather fear, for American
City, the criticism of experts. Would it at all events be your idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had then just ruefully asked, <div class="bookquote">``to send me there for safety?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we may have to come to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go anywhere you want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must see first--it will be only if we have to come to it. There are
things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had gone on, <div class="bookquote">``that father puts away--the bigger and more
cumbrous of course, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stores, has already stored in masses, here
and in Paris, in Italy, in Spain, in warehouses, vaults, banks, safes,
wonderful secret places. We've been like a pair of pirates--positively
stage pirates, the sort who wink at each other and say `Ha-ha!' when
they come to where their treasure is buried. Ours is buried pretty well
everywhere--except what we like to see, what we travel with and have
about us. These, the smaller pieces, are the things we take out and
arrange as we can, to make the hotels we stay at and the houses we hire
a little less ugly. Of course it's a danger, and we have to keep watch.
But father loves a fine piece, loves, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says, the good of it, and
it's for the company of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) things that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s willing to run his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
risks. And we've had extraordinary luck'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--Maggie had made that point;
<div class="bookquote">``we've never lost anything yet. And the finest objects are often the
smallest. Values, in lots of cases, you must know, have nothing to do
with size. But there's nothing, however tiny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had wound up, <div class="bookquote">``that
we've missed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like the class,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had laughed for this, <div class="bookquote">``in which you place me! I
shall be one of the little pieces that you unpack at the hotels, or at
the worst in the hired houses, like this wonderful one, and put out with
the family photographs and the new magazines. But it's something not to
be so big that I have to be buried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had returned, <div class="bookquote">``you shall not be buried, my dear, till you're
dead. Unless indeed you call it burial to go to American City.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Before I pronounce I should like to see my tomb.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had, after
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fashion, the last word in their interchange, save for the result of
an observation that had risen to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips at the beginning, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
then checked, and which now came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Good, bad or indifferent,
I hope there's one thing you believe about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sounded solemn, even to himself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had taken it gaily. <div class="bookquote">``Ah,
don't fix me down to `one'! I believe things enough about you, my dear,
to have a few left if most of them, even, go to smash. I've taken care
of THAT. I've divided my faith into water-tight compartments. We must
manage not to sink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do believe I'm not a hypocrite? You recognise that I don't lie or
dissemble or deceive? Is THAT water-tight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The question, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given a certain intensity, had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered, stare an instant, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) colour rising as if it had sounded
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) still stranger than he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had intended. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had perceived on the spot
that any SERIOUS discussion of veracity, of loyalty, or rather of the
want of them, practically took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) unprepared, as if it were quite new
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had noticed it before: it was the English, the American sign
that duplicity, like <div class="bookquote">``love,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>had to be joked about. It couldn't be <div class="bookquote">``gone
into.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So the note of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) inquiry was--well, to call it nothing else--
premature; a mistake worth making, however, for the almost overdone
drollery in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) answer instinctively sought refuge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Water-tight--the biggest compartment of all? Why, it's the best cabin
and the main deck and the engine-room and the steward's pantry! It's the
ship itself--it's the whole line. It's the captain's table and all one's
luggage--one's reading for the trip.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had images, like that, that
were drawn from steamers and trains, from a familiarity with <div class="bookquote">``lines,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>a
command of <div class="bookquote">``own''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>cars, from an experience of continents and seas,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was unable as yet to emulate; from vast modern machineries and
facilities whose acquaintance he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had still to make, but as to which it
was part of the interest of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) situation as it stood that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could,
quite without wincing, feel his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) future likely to bristle with them.

<p/>It was in fact, content as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) engagement and charming as
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) affianced bride, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) view of THAT furniture that mainly
constituted our young man's <div class="bookquote">``romance'' (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>--and to an extent that made of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
inward state a contrast that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was intelligent enough to feel. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was
intelligent enough to feel quite humble, to wish not to be in the least
hard or voracious, not to insist on his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own side of the bargain, to warn
himself in short against arrogance and greed. Odd enough, of a truth,
was his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sense of this last danger--which may illustrate moreover his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
general attitude toward dangers from within. Personally, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) considered,
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hadn't the vices in question--and that was so much to the good. His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
race, on the other hand, had had them handsomely enough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was
somehow full of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) race. Its presence in him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was like the consciousness
of some inexpugnable scent in which his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) clothes, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) whole person,
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hands and the hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) head, might have been steeped as in some
chemical bath: the effect was nowhere in particular, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) constantly
felt himself at the mercy of the cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) antenatal history,
knew it in every detail, and it was a thing to keep causes well before
him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). What was his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) frank judgment of so much of its ugliness, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) asked
himself, but a part of the cultivation of humility? What was this so
important step he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had just taken but the desire for some new history
that should, so far as possible, contradict, and even if need be flatly
dishonour, the old? If what had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wouldn't do he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) must
MAKE something different. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) perfectly recognised--always in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
humility--that the material for the making had to be Mr. Verver's
millions. There was nothing else for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) on earth to make it with; he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
had tried before--had had to look about and see the truth. Humble as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
was, at the same time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was not so humble as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had known himself
frivolous or stupid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had an idea--which may amuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) historian--that
when you were stupid enough to be mistaken about such a matter you did
know it. Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wasn't mistaken--his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) future might be MIGHT be
scientific. There was nothing in himself, at all events, to prevent it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was allying himself to science, for what was science but the absence
of prejudice backed by the presence of money? His (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) life would be full
of machinery, which was the antidote to superstition, which was in
its turn, too much, the consequence, or at least the exhalation, of
archives. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) thought of these--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) not being at all events futile,
and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) absolute acceptance of the developments of the coming age to
redress the balance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) being so differently considered. The moments
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) most winced were those at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) found himself believing that,
really, futility would have been forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>). Even WITH it, in that
absurd view, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) would have been good enough. Such was the laxity, in the
Ververs, of the romantic spirit. They didn't, indeed, poor dears, know
what, in that line--the line of futility--the real thing meant. HE (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) did--
having seen it, having tried it, having taken its measure. This was a
memory in fact simply to screen out--much as, just in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) walked, the iron shutter of a shop, closing early to the stale summer
day, rattled down at the turn of some crank. There was machinery again,
just as the plate glass, all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), was money, was power, the power
of the rich peoples. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was OF them now, of the rich peoples; he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
was on their side--if it wasn't rather the pleasanter way of putting it
that they were on his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>).

<p/>Something of this sort was in any case the moral and the murmur of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
walk. It would have been ridiculous--such a moral from such a source--if
it hadn't all somehow fitted to the gravity of the hour, that gravity
the oppression of which I began by recording. Another feature was the
immediate nearness of the arrival of the contingent from home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was to
meet them at Charing Cross on the morrow: his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) younger brother, who had
married before him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), but whose wife, of Hebrew race, with a portion that
had gilded the pill, was not in a condition to travel; his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) sister and
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband, the most anglicised of Milanesi, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) maternal uncle, the
most shelved of diplomatists, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) Roman cousin, Don Ottavio, the
most disponible of ex-deputies and of relatives--a scant handful of the
consanguineous who, in spite of Maggie's plea for hymeneal reserve,
were to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) to the altar. It was no great array, yet it was
apparently to be a more numerous muster than any possible to the bride
herself, having no wealth of kinship to choose from and making it up,
on the other hand, by loose invitations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had been interested in the
girl's attitude on the matter and had wholly deferred to it, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>),
as it did, a glimpse, distinctly pleasing, of the kind of ruminations
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would in general be governed by--which were quite such as fell in
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) own taste. They hadn't natural relations, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
father, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had explained; so they wouldn't try to supply the place
by artificial, by make-believe ones, by any searching of highways and
hedges. Oh yes, they had acquaintances enough--but a marriage was an
intimate thing. You asked acquaintances when you HAD your kith and
kin--you asked them over and above. But you didn't ask them alone, to
cover your nudity and look like what they weren't. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
meant and what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) liked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) was all ready to take from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), finding
a good omen in both of the facts. He (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) expected her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), desired her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), to have
character; his (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) wife SHOULD have it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) wasn't afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) having
much. He (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) had had, in his (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) earlier time, to deal with plenty of people who
had had it; notably with the three four ecclesiastics, his (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) great-uncle,
the Cardinal, above all, who had taken a hand and played a part in his (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>)
education: the effect of all of which had never been to upset him (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>)
was thus fairly on the look-out for the characteristic in this most
intimate, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was to come, of his (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) associates. He (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) encouraged it when
it appeared.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) felt therefore, just at present, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) papers were in order, as
if his (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) accounts so balanced as they had never done in his (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) life before
and he (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) might close the portfolio with a snap. It would open again,
doubtless, of itself, with the arrival of the Romans; it would even
perhaps open with his (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) dining to-night in Portland Place, where Mr.
Verver had pitched a tent suggesting that of Alexander furnished with
the spoils of Darius. But what meanwhile marked his (<font color='blue'><b>Darius</b></font>) crisis, as I have
said, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Darius</b></font>) sense of the immediate two or three hours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darius</b></font>) paused
on corners, at crossings; there kept rising for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darius</b></font>), in waves, that
consciousness, sharp as to its source while vague as to its end, which I
began by speaking of--the consciousness of an appeal to do something
or other, before it was too late, for himself. By any friend to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might have mentioned it the appeal could have been turned to frank
derision. For what, for whom indeed but himself and the high advantages
attached, was he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) about to marry an extraordinarily charming girl, whose
<div class="bookquote">``prospects,''  (<font color='red'><b>an girl prospects</b></font>)</div>of the solid sort, were as guaranteed as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) amiability?
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wasn't to do it, assuredly, all for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). The Prince, as happened,
however, was so free to feel and yet not to formulate that there rose
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) after a little, definitely, the image of a friend whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
often found ironic. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) withheld the tribute of attention from passing
faces only to let his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) impulse accumulate. Youth and beauty made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
scarcely turn, but the image of Mrs. Assingham made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) presently stop a
hansom. HER youth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) beauty were things more or less of the past,
but to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) at home, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) possibly might, would be <div class="bookquote">``doing''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>what
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) still had time for, would put something of a reason into his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
restlessness and thereby probably soothe it. To recognise the propriety
of this particular pilgrimage--she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) lived far enough off, in long Cadogan
Place--was already in fact to work it off a little. A perception of the
propriety of formally thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), and of timing the act just as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
happened to be doing--this, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) made out as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went, was obviously all
that had been the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). It was true that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had mistaken the
mood of the moment, misread it rather, superficially, as an impulse
to look the other way--the other way from where his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pledges had
accumulated. Mrs. Assingham, precisely, represented, embodied his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
pledges--was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) pleasant person, the force that had set them
successively in motion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had MADE his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) marriage, quite as truly as his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
papal ancestor had made his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) family--though he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could scarce see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
had made it for unless because she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) too was perversely romantic. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
neither bribed nor persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) nothing--scarce
even till now articulate thanks; so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) profit-to think of it
vulgarly--must have all had to come from the Ververs.

<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was far, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could still remind himself, from supposing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
had been grossly remunerated. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was wholly sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) hadn't; for if
there were people who took presents and people who didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) would be
quite on the right side and of the proud class. Only then, on the other
hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) disinterestedness was rather awful--it implied, that is,
such abysses of confidence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was admirably attached to Maggie--whose
possession of such a friend might moreover quite rank as one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``assets'' (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div>; but the great proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) affection had been in bringing
them, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) design, together. Meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) during a winter in Rome,
meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) afterwards in Paris, and <div class="bookquote">``liking''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had in time
frankly let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) know from the first, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had marked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) young
friend's own and had then, unmistakably, presented him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in a light. But
the interest in Maggie--that was the point--would have achieved
but little without her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) interest in HIM. On what did that sentiment,
unsolicited and unrecompensed, rest? what good, again--for it was much
like his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) question about Mr. Verver--should he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ever have done her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)? The
Prince's notion of a recompense to women--similar in this to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) notion
of an appeal--was more or less to make love to them. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hadn't, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) believed, made love the least little bit to Mrs. Assingham--nor did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) think she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had for a moment supposed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) liked in these days, to
mark them off, the women to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hadn't made love: it represented--
and that was what pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in it--a different stage of existence
from the time at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) liked to mark off the women to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
had. Neither, with all this, had Mrs. Assingham herself been either
aggressive or resentful. On what occasion, ever, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) appeared
to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wanting? These things, the motives of such people, were
obscure--a little alarmingly so; they contributed to that element of
the impenetrable which alone slightly qualified his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) good
fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) remembered to have read, as a boy, a wonderful tale by Allan
Poe, his (<font color='blue'><b>Poe</b></font>) prospective wife's countryman-which was a thing to show, by the
way, what imagination Americans COULD have: the story of the shipwrecked
Gordon Pym, who, drifting in a small boat further toward the North
Pole--or was it the South?--than anyone had ever done, found at a given
moment before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) a thickness of white air that was like a dazzling
curtain of light, concealing as darkness conceals, yet of the colour of
milk or of snow. There were moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) own boat move upon
some such mystery. The state of mind of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) new friends, including Mrs.
Assingham herself, had resemblances to a great white curtain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) had
never known curtains but as purple even to blackness--but as producing
where they hung a darkness intended and ominous. When they were so
disposed as to shelter surprises the surprises were apt to be shocks.

<p/>Shocks, however, from these quite different depths, were not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) saw
reason to apprehend; what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) rather seemed to himself not yet to have
measured was something that, seeking a name for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) would have called
the quantity of confidence reposed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) had stood still, at many
a moment of the previous month, with the thought, freshly determined or
renewed, of the general expectation--to define it roughly--of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>)
was the subject. What was singular was that it seemed not so much
an expectation of anything in particular as a large, bland, blank
assumption of merits almost beyond notation, of essential quality and
value. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) had been some old embossed coin, of a purity of
gold no longer used, stamped with glorious arms, mediaeval, wonderful,
of which the <div class="bookquote">``worth''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in mere modern change, sovereigns and half crowns,
would be great enough, but as to which, since there were finer ways of
using it, such taking to pieces was superfluous. That was the image for
the security in which it was open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) to rest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) was to constitute a
possession, yet was to escape being reduced to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) component parts.
What would this mean but that, practically, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) was never to be tried or
tested? What would it mean but that, if they didn't <div class="bookquote">``change''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>),
they really wouldn't know--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) wouldn't know himself--how many pounds,
shillings and pence he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) had to give? These at any rate, for the present,
were unanswerable questions; all that was before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) was
invested with attributes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) was taken seriously. Lost there in the
white mist was the seriousness in them that made them so take him (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>).
It was even in Mrs. Assingham, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) having, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had
frequently shown, a more mocking spirit. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) could say as yet was
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) had done nothing, so far as to break any charm. What should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) do if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) were to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) frankly this afternoon what was, morally
speaking, behind their veil. It would come to asking what they expected
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) would answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) probably: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you know, it's what we
expect you to be!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) would have no resource but to deny his (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>)
knowledge. Would that break the spell, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) had no idea? What
idea in fact could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) have? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) also took himself seriously--made a
point of it; but it wasn't simply a question of fancy and pretension.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) own estimate he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) saw ways, at one time and another, of dealing with:
but theirs, sooner or later, say what they might, would put him (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) to the
practical proof. As the practical proof, accordingly, would naturally be
proportionate to the cluster of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) attributes, one arrived at a scale
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) was not, honestly, the man to calculate. Who but a billionaire
could say what was fair exchange for a billion? That measure was the
shrouded object, but he (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) felt really, as his (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) cab stopped in Cadogan
Place, a little nearer the shroud. He (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) promised himself, virtually, to
give the latter a twitch.



<p/>II

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're not good days, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) had said to Fanny Assingham after
declaring himself grateful for finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), and then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) cup of
tea, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) in possession of the latest news--the documents signed
an hour ago, de part et d’autre, and the telegram from his (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) backers, who
had reached Paris the morning before, and who, pausing there a little,
poor dears, seemed to think the whole thing a tremendous lark. <div class="bookquote">``We're
very simple folk, mere country cousins compared with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) had also
observed, <div class="bookquote">``and Paris, for my sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband, is the end of the
world. London therefore will be more or less another planet. It has
always been, as with so many of us, quite their Mecca, but this is their
first real caravan; they've mainly known `old England' as a shop
for articles in india-rubber and leather, in which they've dressed
themselves as much as possible. Which all means, however, that you'll
see them, all of them, wreathed in smiles. We must be very easy with
them. Maggie's too wonderful--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) preparations are on a scale! She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
insists on taking in the sposi and my uncle. The others will come to
me. I've been engaging their rooms at the hotel, and, with all those
solemn signatures of an hour ago, that brings the case home to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean you're afraid?''  (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) hostess had amusedly asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Terribly afraid. I've now but to wait to see the monster come. They're
not good days; they're neither one thing nor the other. I've really got
nothing, yet I've everything to lose. One doesn't know what still may
happen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The way she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) was for an instant almost irritating; it came
out, for his (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) fancy, from behind the white curtain. It was a sign, that
is, of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) deep serenity, which worried instead of soothing him (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>). And to
be soothed, after all, to be tided over, in his (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) mystic impatience, to
be told what he (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) could understand and believe--that was what he (<font color='blue'><b>billionaire</b></font>) had
come for. <div class="bookquote">``Marriage then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``is what you call the
monster? I admit it's a fearful thing at the best; but, for heaven's
sake, if that's what you're thinking of, don't run away from it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, to run away from it would be to run away from you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince
replied; <div class="bookquote">``and I've already told you often enough how I depend on you to
see me through.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) so liked the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) took this, from the corner
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) sofa, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) sincerity--for it WAS sincerity--fuller
expression. <div class="bookquote">``I'm starting on the great voyage--across the unknown sea;
my ship's all rigged and appointed, the cargo's stowed away and the
company complete. But what seems the matter with me is that I can't sail
alone; my ship must be one of a pair, must have, in the waste of waters,
a--what do you call it?--a consort. I don't ask you to stay on board
with me, but I must keep your sail in sight for orientation. I don't in
the least myself know, I assure you, the points of the compass. But with
a lead I can perfectly follow. You MUST be my lead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``where I should take you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, from your having brought me safely thus far. I should never have
got here without you. You've provided the ship itself, and, if you've
not quite seen me aboard, you've attended me, ever so kindly, to the
dock. Your own vessel is, all conveniently, in the next berth, and you
can't desert me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) again her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) amusement, which struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) even as excessive,
as if, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) also a little nervous; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) treated
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in fine as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) were not uttering truths, but making pretty figures
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) diversion. <div class="bookquote">``My vessel, dear Prince?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``What vessel,
in the world, have I? This little house is all our ship, Bob's and
mine--and thankful we are, now, to have it. We've wandered far, living,
as you may say, from hand to mouth, without rest for the soles of our
feet. But the time has come for us at last to draw in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) made at this, the young man, an indignant protest. <div class="bookquote">``You talk about
rest--it's too selfish!--when you're just launching me on adventures?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) head with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) kind lucidity. <div class="bookquote">``Not adventures--heaven
forbid! You've had yours--as I've had mine; and my idea has been, all
along, that we should neither of us begin again. My own last, precisely,
has been doing for you all you so prettily mention. But it consists
simply in having conducted you to rest. You talk about ships, but
they're not the comparison. Your tossings are over--you're practically
IN port. The port,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) concluded, <div class="bookquote">``of the Golden Isles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked about, to put himself more in relation with the place; then,
after an hesitation, seemed to speak certain words instead of certain
others. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know where I AM--! I do decline to be left, but what I
came for, of course, was to thank you. If to-day has seemed, for the
first time, the end of preliminaries, I feel how little there would have
been any at all without you. The first were wholly yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``they were remarkably easy. I've seen them,
I've HAD them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``more difficult. Everything, you must feel,
went of itself. So, you must feel, everything still goes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince quickly agreed. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, beautifully! But you had the
conception.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Prince, so had you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) harder a moment. <div class="bookquote">``You had it first. You had it most.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) look as if it had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wonder. <div class="bookquote">``I LIKED it, if
that's what you mean. But you liked it surely yourself. I protest, that
I had easy work with you. I had only at last--when I thought it was
time--to speak for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All that is quite true. But you're leaving me, all the same, you're
leaving me--you're washing your hands of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``However, that
won't be easy; I won't BE left.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes about again,
taking in the pretty room that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had just described as her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) final
refuge, the place of peace for a world-worn couple, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had
lately retired with <div class="bookquote">``Bob.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall keep this spot in sight. Say what
you will, I shall need you. I'm not, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) declared, <div class="bookquote">``going to
give you up for anybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you're afraid--which of course you're not--are you trying to make me
the same?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) asked after a moment.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) waited a minute too, then answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) with a question. <div class="bookquote">``You say you
`liked' it, your undertaking to make my engagement possible. It remains
beautiful for me that you did; it's charming and unforgettable. But,
still more, it's mysterious and wonderful. WHY, you dear delightful
woman, did you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I scarce know what to make,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``of such an inquiry. If you
haven't by this time found out yourself, what meaning can anything I say
have for you? Don't you really after all feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) added while nothing
came from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``aren't you conscious every minute, of the perfection of
the creature of whom I've put you into possession?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every minute--gratefully conscious. But that's exactly the ground of
my question. It wasn't only a matter of your handing me over--it was a
matter of your handing her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>). It was a matter of HER fate still more than
of mine. You thought all the good of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) that one woman can think of
another, and yet, by your account, you enjoyed assisting at her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) risk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) spoke, and this was what, visibly,
determined a repetition for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Are you trying to frighten me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's a foolish view--I should be too vulgar. You apparently can't
understand either my good faith or my humility. I'm awfully humble,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man insisted; <div class="bookquote">``that's the way I've been feeling to-day, with
everything so finished and ready. And you won't take me for serious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) continued to face him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) a little. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
you deep old Italians!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned--<div class="bookquote">``it's what I wanted you to come to. That's
the responsible note.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) went on--<div class="bookquote">``if you're `humble' you MUST be dangerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had a pause while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only smiled; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I don't in the
least want to lose sight of you. But even if I did I shouldn't think it
right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you for that--it's what I needed of you. I'm sure, after all,
that the more you're with me the more I shall understand. It's the
only thing in the world I want. I'm excellent, I really think, all
round--except that I'm stupid. I can do pretty well anything I SEE. But
I've got to see it first.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) demonstration. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
in the least mind its having to be shown me--in fact I like that better.
Therefore it is that I want, that I shall always want, your eyes.
Through THEM I wish to look--even at any risk of their showing me what I
mayn't like. For then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``I shall know. And of that I shall
never be afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) might quite have been waiting to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would come to, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
spoke with a certain impatience. <div class="bookquote">``What on earth are you talking about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could perfectly say: <div class="bookquote">``Of my real, honest fear of being `off'
some day, of being wrong, WITHOUT knowing it. That's what I shall always
trust you for--to tell me when I am. No--with you people it's a sense.
We haven't got it--not as you have. Therefore--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said
enough. <div class="bookquote">``Ecco!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simply smiled.

<p/>It was not to be concealed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), but of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
had always liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I should be interested,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) presently remarked,
<div class="bookquote">``to see some sense you don't possess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) produced one on the spot. <div class="bookquote">``The moral, dear Mrs. Assingham. I
mean, always, as you others consider it. I've of course something that
in our poor dear backward old Rome sufficiently passes for it. But it's
no more like yours than the tortuous stone staircase--half-ruined into
the bargain!--in some castle of our quattrocento is like the `lightning
elevator' in one of Mr. Verver's fifteen-storey buildings. Your moral
sense works by steam--it sends you up like a rocket. Ours is slow and
steep and unlighted, with so many of the steps missing that--well, that
it's as short, in almost any case, to turn round and come down again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Trusting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham smiled, <div class="bookquote">``to get up some other way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--or not to have to get up at all. However,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I told you
that at the beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Machiavelli!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) simply exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do me too much honour. I wish indeed I had his (<font color='blue'><b>Machiavelli</b></font>) genius. However, if
you really believe I have his (<font color='blue'><b>Machiavelli</b></font>) perversity you wouldn't say it. But it's
all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gaily enough concluded; <div class="bookquote">``I shall always have you to come
to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On this, for a little, they sat face to face; after which, without
comment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have more tea. All she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) would give
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) promptly signified; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) developed, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) laugh, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) idea
that the tea of the English race was somehow their morality, <div class="bookquote">``made,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with boiling water, in a little pot, so that the more of it one drank
the more moral one would become. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drollery served as a transition,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) put to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) several questions about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister and the others,
questions as to what Bob, in particular, Colonel Assingham, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) husband,
could do for the arriving gentlemen, whom, by the Prince's leave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
would immediately go to see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was funny, while they talked, about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own people too, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) described, with anecdotes of their habits,
imitations of their manners and prophecies of their conduct, as more
rococo than anything Cadogan Place would ever have known. This, Mrs.
Assingham professed, was exactly what would endear them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), and
that, in turn, drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) visitor a fresh declaration of all the
comfort of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) being able so to depend on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), at
this point, some twenty minutes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) much longer visits,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) stayed now as if to make his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) attitude prove his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) appreciation. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
stayed moreover--THAT was really the sign of the hour--in spite of the
nervous unrest that had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) and that had in truth much rather
fed on the scepticism by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had apparently meant to soothe it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had not soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), and there arrived, remarkably, a moment when
the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) failure gleamed out. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had not frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
called it--he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) felt that; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was herself not at ease. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had been
nervous, though trying to disguise it; the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), following
on the announcement of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) name, had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) as disconcerted. This
conviction, for the young man, deepened and sharpened; yet with the
effect, too, of making him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glad in spite of it. It was as if, in
calling, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done even better than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended. For it was somehow
IMPORTANT--that was what it was--that there should be at this hour
something the matter with Mrs. Assingham, with whom, in all their
acquaintance, so considerable now, there had never been the least little
thing the matter. To wait thus and watch for it was to know, of a truth,
that there was something the matter with HIM; since strangely, with so
little to go upon--his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) heart had positively begun to beat to the tune
of suspense. It fairly befell at last, for a climax, that they almost
ceased to pretend--to pretend, that is, to cheat each other with forms.
The unspoken had come up, and there was a crisis--neither could have
said how long it lasted--during which they were reduced, for all
interchange, to looking at each other on quite an inordinate scale. They
might at this moment, in their positively portentous stillness, have
been keeping it up for a wager, sitting for their photograph or even
enacting a tableau-vivant.

<p/>The spectator of whom they would thus well have been worthy might have
read meanings of his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) own into the intensity of their communion--or
indeed, even without meanings, have found his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) account, aesthetically,
in some gratified play of our modern sense of type, so scantly to be
distinguished from our modern sense of beauty. Type was there, at the
worst, in Mrs. Assingham's dark, neat head, on which the crisp black
hair made waves so fine and so numerous that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) looked even more in the
fashion of the hour than she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) desired. Full of discriminations against
the obvious, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had yet to accept a flagrant appearance and to make the
best of misleading signs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) richness of hue, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) generous nose, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
eyebrows marked like those of an actress--these things, with an added
amplitude of person on which middle age had set its seal, seemed to
present her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) insistently as a daughter of the south, or still more of the
east, a creature formed by hammocks and divans, fed upon sherbets and
waited upon by slaves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) looked as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) most active effort might be
to take up, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) lay back, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) mandolin, or to share a sugared fruit
with a pet gazelle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was in fact, however, neither a pampered Jewess
nor a lazy Creole; New York had been, recordedly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) birthplace and
<div class="bookquote">``Europe''  (<font color='red'><b>a Jewess Creole</b></font>)</div>punctually her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) discipline. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wore yellow and purple because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) thought it better, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said, while one was about it, to look like
the Queen of Sheba than like a revendeuse; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) put pearls in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) hair
and crimson and gold in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) tea-gown for the same reason: it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>)
theory that nature itself had overdressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) only course
was to drown, as it was hopeless to try to chasten, the overdressing.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) was covered and surrounded with <div class="bookquote">``things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which were frankly toys
and shams, a part of the amusement with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) rejoiced to supply
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) friends. These friends were in the game that of playing with the
disparity between her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) aspect and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) character. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) character was
attested by the second movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) face, which convinced the
beholder that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) vision of the humours of the world was not supine,
not passive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) enjoyed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) needed the warm air of friendship, but the
eyes of the American city looked out, somehow, for the opportunity
of it, from under the lids of Jerusalem. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) false indolence, in
short, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) false leisure, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) false pearls and palms and courts and
fountains, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) was a person for whom life was multitudinous detail,
detail that left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>), as it at any moment found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>), unappalled and
unwearied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophisticated as I may appear'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) frequent phrase--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) had
found sympathy her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) best resource. It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) plenty to do; it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>),
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) also said, sit up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) life two great holes to fill,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) described herself as dropping social scraps into them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) had
known old ladies, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) early American time, drop morsels of silk
into the baskets in which they collected the material for some eventual
patchwork quilt.

<p/>One of these gaps in Mrs. Assingham's completeness was her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) want of
children; the other was her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) want of wealth. It was wonderful how little
either, in the fulness of time, came to show; sympathy and curiosity
could render their objects practically filial, just as an English
husband who in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) military years had <div class="bookquote">``run''  (<font color='red'><b>an husband everything</b></font>)</div>everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) regiment
could make economy blossom like the rose. Colonel Bob had, a few years
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) marriage, left the army, which had clearly, by that time, done
its laudable all for the enrichment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) personal experience, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) could thus give his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) whole time to the gardening in question. There
reigned among the younger friends of this couple a legend, almost
too venerable for historical criticism, that the marriage itself,
the happiest of its class, dated from the far twilight of the age,
a primitive period when such things--such things as American girls
accepted as <div class="bookquote">``good enough'' (<font color='red'><b>girls</b></font>)</div>--had not begun to be;--so that the pleasant
pair had been, as to the risk taken on either side, bold and original,
honourably marked, for the evening of life, as discoverers of a kind of
hymeneal Northwest Passage. Mrs. Assingham knew better, knew there had
been no historic hour, from that of Pocahontas down, when some young
Englishman hadn't precipitately believed and some American girl
hadn't, with a few more gradations, availed herself to the full of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) incapacity to doubt; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) accepted resignedly the laurel of the
founder, since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was in fact pretty well the doyenne, above ground,
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) transplanted tribe, and since, above all, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) HAD invented
combinations, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not invented Bob's own. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) who had
done that, absolutely puzzled it out, by himself, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) first odd
glimmer-resting upon it moreover, through the years to come, as proof
enough, in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>), by itself, of the higher cleverness. If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own
cleverness up it was largely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) should have full credit. There were
moments in truth when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) privately felt how little--striking out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)
had done--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) could have afforded that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should show the common limits.
But Mrs. Assingham's cleverness was in truth tested when her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) present
visitor at last said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I don't think, you know, that you're
treating me quite right. You've something on your mind that you don't
tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>It was positive too that her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) smile, in reply, was a trifle dim. <div class="bookquote">``Am I
obliged to tell you everything I have on my mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't a question of everything, but it's a question of anything that
may particularly concern me. Then you shouldn't keep it back. You know
with what care I desire to proceed, taking everything into account and
making no mistake that may possibly injure HER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham, at this, had after an instant an odd interrogation.
```Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)'?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) and him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Both our friends. Either Maggie or her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have something on my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham presently returned;
<div class="bookquote">``something has happened for which I hadn't been prepared. But it isn't
anything that properly concerns you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince, with immediate gaiety, threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``What do you
mean by `properly'? I somehow see volumes in it. It's the way people put
a thing when they put it--well, wrong. _I_ put things right. What is it
that has happened for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>hostess moment</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hostess, the next moment, had drawn spirit from his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I shall be delighted if you'll take your share of it. Charlotte
Stant is in London. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) has just been here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Stant? Oh really?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div>The Prince expressed clear surprise--a
transparency through which his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes met his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) friend's with a certain
hardness of concussion. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) has arrived from America?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) then quickly
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) appears to have arrived this noon--coming up from Southampton; at
an hotel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) dropped upon me after luncheon and was here for more than
an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man heard with interest, though not with an interest too great
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) gaiety. <div class="bookquote">``You think then I've a share in it? What IS my share?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, any you like--the one you seemed just now eager to take. It was
you yourself who insisted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) on this with conscious inconsistency, and she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) could now
see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had changed colour. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was always easy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know then what the matter was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't think it could be so bad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you call it very bad?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man asked. <div class="bookquote">``Only,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) smiled,
<div class="bookquote">``because that's the way it seems to affect YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hesitated, still with the trace of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quickened colour, still
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>), still adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner. <div class="bookquote">``But you allowed you were
upset.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the extent--yes--of not having in the least looked for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). Any
more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``than I judge Maggie to have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince thought; then as if glad to be able to say something very
natural and true: <div class="bookquote">``No--quite right. Maggie hasn't looked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). But
I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll be delighted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, certainly'' (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div>--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hostess spoke with a different shade of
gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll be quite overjoyed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince went on. <div class="bookquote">``Has Miss Stant now
gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has gone back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hotel, to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) things here. I can't have
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``alone at an hotel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s here at all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must stay with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) quite took it in. <div class="bookquote">``So
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s coming now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at any moment. If you wait you'll see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) promptly declared--<div class="bookquote">``charming!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But this word came out as if,
a little, in sudden substitution for some other. It sounded accidental,
whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wished to be firm. That accordingly was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) next showed
himself. <div class="bookquote">``If it wasn't for what's going on these next days Maggie would
certainly want to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). In fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) lucidly continued, <div class="bookquote">``isn't
what's happening just a reason to MAKE her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) want to?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham, for
answer, only looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), and this, the next instant, had apparently
had more effect than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had spoken. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) asked a question that
seemed incongruous. <div class="bookquote">``What has she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) come for!''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>It made his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) companion laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Why, for just what you say. For your
marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wondered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie's--it's the same thing. It's `for' your great event. And then,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s so lonely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) given you that as a reason?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I scarcely remember--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gave me so many. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) abounds, poor dear, in
reasons. But there's one that, whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) does, I always remember for
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And which is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) ought to guess but couldn't.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has no home--absolutely none whatever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s
extraordinarily alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) took it in. <div class="bookquote">``And also has no great means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very small ones. Which is not, however, with the expense of railways
and hotels, a reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) running to and fro.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doesn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Hers, my dear man?--it's little enough `hers.''' The attribution, for
the moment, amused his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hostess. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) has rebounded now--but she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) has had
little enough else to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I say hers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince pleasantly explained, <div class="bookquote">``very much as, at
this time of day, I might say mine. I quite feel, I assure you, as if
the great place already more or less belonged to ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's your good fortune and your point of view. You own--or you soon
practically WILL own--so much of it. Charlotte owns almost nothing in
the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tells me, but two colossal trunks-only one of which I
have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) leave to introduce into this house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'ll depreciate to
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham added, <div class="bookquote">``your property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) thought of these things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) thought of every thing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had always
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) resource at hand of turning all to the easy. <div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) come with
designs upon me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then in a moment, as if even this were almost too
grave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) sounded the note that had least to do with himself. <div class="bookquote">``Est-elle
toujours aussi belle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>That was the furthest point, somehow, to which
Charlotte Stant could be relegated.

<p/>Mrs. Assingham treated it freely. <div class="bookquote">``Just the same. The person in the
world, to my sense, whose looks are most subject to appreciation. It's
all in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) affects you. One admires her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) if one doesn't happen
not to. So, as well, one criticises her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's not fair!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>said the Prince.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To criticise her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)? Then there you are! You're answered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm answered.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) took it, humorously, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) lesson--sank his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) previous
self-consciousness, with excellent effect, in grateful docility. <div class="bookquote">``I only
meant that there are perhaps better things to be done with Miss Stant
than to criticise her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). When once you begin THAT, with anyone--!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was
vague and kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite agree that it's better to keep out of it as long as one can.
But when one MUST do it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) asked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``Then know what you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``_I_ don't know what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's what, just now, in all ways, you particularly should know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham, however, made no more of this, having, before anything
else, apparently, a scruple about the tone she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had just used. <div class="bookquote">``I quite
understand, of course, that, given her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) great friendship with Maggie, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
should have wanted to be present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has acted impulsively--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has
acted generously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has acted beautifully,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>said the Prince.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say `generously' because I mean she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hasn't, in any way, counted the
cost. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'ll have it to count, in a manner, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hostess continued.
<div class="bookquote">``But that doesn't matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could see how little. <div class="bookquote">``You'll look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it's all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham. <div class="bookquote">``Then why are you troubled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) up--but only for a minute. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not--any more than you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince's dark blue eyes were of the finest, and, on occasion,
precisely, resembled nothing so much as the high windows of a Roman
palace, of an historic front by one of the great old designers, thrown
open on a feast-day to the golden air. His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) look itself, at such times,
suggested an image--that of some very noble personage who, expected,
acclaimed by the crowd in the street and with old precious stuffs
falling over the sill for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) support, had gaily and gallantly come to
show himself: always moreover less in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own interest than in that
of spectators and subjects whose need to admire, even to gape, was
periodically to be considered. The young man's expression became,
after this fashion, something vivid and concrete--a beautiful personal
presence, that of a prince in very truth, a ruler, warrior, patron,
lighting up brave architecture and diffusing the sense of a function. It
had been happily said of his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) face that the figure thus appearing in
the great frame was the ghost of some proudest ancestor. Whoever the
ancestor now, at all events, the Prince was, for Mrs. Assingham's
benefit, in view of the people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) seemed, leaning on crimson damask,
to take in the bright day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked younger than his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) years; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was
beautiful, innocent, vague.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, I'M not!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) rang out clear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to SEE you, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``For you wouldn't have a
shadow of excuse.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) showed how he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would have been at a
loss for one, and the fact of their serenity was thus made as important
as if some danger of its opposite had directly menaced them. The only
thing was that if the evidence of their cheer was so established Mrs.
Assingham had a little to explain her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) original manner, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) came to
this before they dropped the question. <div class="bookquote">``My first impulse is always to
behave, about everything, as if I feared complications. But I don't fear
them--I really like them. They're quite my element.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) deferred, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), to this account of herself. <div class="bookquote">``But still,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if we're not in the presence of a complication.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``A handsome, clever, odd girl staying with one is always

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man weighed it almost as if the question were new to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And
will she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stay very long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend gave a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``How in the world can I know? I've scarcely
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah yes. You can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>But something in the tone of it amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) afresh. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think you
could?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think you could get it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for me--the probable length of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose bravely enough to the occasion and the challenge. <div class="bookquote">``I daresay, if
you were to give me the chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here it is then for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) answered; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had heard, within the
minute, the stop of a cab at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) door. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s back.''



 (<font color='red'><b>friend effect</b></font>)</div><p/>III

<p/>It had been said as a joke, but as, after this, they awaited their
friend in silence, the effect of the silence was to turn the time to
gravity--a gravity not dissipated even when the Prince next spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
had been thinking the case over and making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) mind. A handsome,
clever, odd girl staying with one was a complication. Mrs. Assingham,
so far, was right. But there were the facts--the good relations, from
schooldays, of the two young women, and the clear confidence with which
one of them had arrived. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can come, you know, at any time, to US.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham took it up with an irony beyond laughter. <div class="bookquote">``You'd like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
for your honeymoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, you must keep her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for that. But why not after?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) a minute; then, at the sound of a voice in the
corridor, they had got up. <div class="bookquote">``Why not? You're splendid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>Charlotte Stant,
the next minute, was with them, ushered in as she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) had alighted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)
cab, and prepared for not finding Mrs. Assingham alone--this would have
been to be noticed--by the butler's answer, on the stairs, to a question
put to him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could have looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) hostess with such straightness
and brightness only from knowing that the Prince was also there--the
discrimination of but a moment, yet which let him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) in still
better than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had instantly faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) availed himself of the
chance thus given him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was conscious of all these things. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
accordingly saw, for some seconds, with intensity, was a tall, strong,
charming girl who wore for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), at first, exactly the look of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
adventurous situation, a suggestion, in all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) person, in motion and
gesture, in free, vivid, yet altogether happy indications of dress, from
the becoming compactness of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hat to the shade of tan in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoes, of
winds and waves and custom-houses, of far countries and long journeys,
the knowledge of how and where and the habit, founded on experience,
of not being afraid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was aware, at the same time, that of this
combination the <div class="bookquote">``strongminded''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>note was not, as might have been
apprehended, the basis; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was now sufficiently familiar with
English-speaking types, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had sounded attentively enough such
possibilities, for a quick vision of differences. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had, besides, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
own view of this young lady's strength of mind. It was great, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
ground to believe, but it would never interfere with the play of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
extremely personal, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) always amusing taste. This last was the thing
in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) threw it out positively, on the spot, like a light--that
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might have reappeared, during these moments, just to cool his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
worried eyes with. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) light that immediate, exclusive
address to their friend was like a lamp she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was holding aloft for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
benefit and for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pleasure. It showed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) everything--above all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
presence in the world, so closely, so irretrievably contemporaneous with
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own: a sharp, sharp fact, sharper during these instants than any
other at all, even than that of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) marriage, but accompanied, in a
subordinate and controlled way, with those others, facial, physiognomic,
that Mrs. Assingham had been speaking of as subject to appreciation.
So they were, these others, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) met them again, and that was the
connection they instantly established with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). If they had to be
interpreted, this made at least for intimacy. There was but one way
certainly for HIM--to interpret them in the sense of the already known.

<p/>Making use then of clumsy terms of excess, the face was too narrow and
too long, the eyes not large, and the mouth, on the other hand, by
no means small, with substance in its lips and a slight, the very
slightest, tendency to protrusion in the solid teeth, otherwise indeed
well arrayed and flashingly white. But it was, strangely, as a cluster
of possessions of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own that these things, in Charlotte Stant, now
affected him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>); items in a full list, items recognised, each of them, as
if, for the long interval, they had been <div class="bookquote">``stored''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>wrapped up, numbered,
put away in a cabinet. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) faced Mrs. Assingham the door of the
cabinet had opened of itself; he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) took the relics out, one by one, and it
was more and more, each instant, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) were giving him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) time. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) saw
again that her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) thick hair was, vulgarly speaking, brown, but that there
was a shade of tawny autumn leaf in it, for <div class="bookquote">``appreciation'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--a colour
indescribable and of which he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had known no other case, something that
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) at moments the sylvan head of a huntress. He (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>) saw the sleeves
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) jacket drawn to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) wrists, but he (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>) again made out the free arms
within them to be of the completely rounded, the polished slimness that
Florentine sculptors, in the great time, had loved, and of which the
apparent firmness is expressed in their old silver and old bronze. He (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>)
knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) narrow hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) long fingers and the shape and colour
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) finger-nails, he (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) special beauty of movement and line
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) back, and the perfect working of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) main
attachments, that of some wonderful finished instrument, something
intently made for exhibition, for a prize. He (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>) knew above all the
extraordinary fineness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) flexible waist, the stem of an expanded
flower, which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) a likeness also to some long, loose silk purse,
well filled with gold pieces, but having been passed, empty, through a
finger-ring that held it together. It was as if, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) turned to
him (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>) had weighed the whole thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>) open palm and even heard
a little the chink of the metal. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) did turn to him (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>) it was to
recognise with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) eyes what he (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>) might have been doing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) made no
circumstance of thus coming upon him (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>), save so far as the intelligence in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) face could at any moment make a circumstance of almost anything. If
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) moved off she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) looked like a huntress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) looked when she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) came
nearer like his (<font color='blue'><b>huntress</b></font>) notion, perhaps not wholly correct, of a muse. But what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) said was simply: <div class="bookquote">``You see you're not rid of me. How is dear Maggie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was to come soon enough by the quite unforced operation of chance,
the young man's opportunity to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) the question suggested by Mrs.
Assingham shortly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) entrance. The license, had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chosen to
embrace it, was within a few minutes all there--the license given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
literally to inquire of this young lady how long she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was likely to
be with them. For a matter of the mere domestic order had quickly
determined, on Mrs. Assingham's part, a withdrawal, of a few moments,
which had the effect of leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) visitors free. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Betterman's
there?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had said to Charlotte in allusion to some member of the
household who was to have received her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) and seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) belongings settled;
to which Charlotte had replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had encountered only the butler,
who had been quite charming. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had deprecated any action taken on
behalf of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) effects; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hostess, rebounding from accumulated
cushions, evidently saw more in Mrs. Betterman's non-appearance
than could meet the casual eye. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Betterman</b></font>) saw, in short, demanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Betterman</b></font>)
intervention, in spite of an earnest <div class="bookquote">``Let ME go!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>from the girl, and a
prolonged smiling wail over the trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>Betterman</b></font>) was giving. The Prince was
quite aware, at this moment, that departure, for himself, was indicated;
the question of Miss Stant's installation didn't demand his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) presence;
it was a case for one to go away--if one hadn't a reason for staying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
had a reason, however--of that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was equally aware; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had not
for a good while done anything more conscious and intentional than
not, quickly, to take leave. His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) visible insistence--for it came to
that--even demanded of him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) a certain disagreeable effort, the sort of
effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had mostly associated with acting for an idea. His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) idea was
there, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) idea was to find out something, something he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wanted much to
know, and to find it out not tomorrow, not at some future time, not in
short with waiting and wondering, but if possible before quitting the
place. This particular curiosity, moreover, confounded itself a little
with the occasion offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to satisfy Mrs. Assingham's own; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
wouldn't have admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was staying to ask a rude question--there
was distinctly nothing rude in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) having his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) reasons. It would be rude,
for that matter, to turn one's back, without a word or two, on an old
friend.

<p/>Well, as it came to pass, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) got the word or two, for Mrs. Assingham's
preoccupation was practically simplifying. The little crisis was of
shorter duration than our account of it; duration, naturally, would have
forced him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to take up his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hat. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was somehow glad, on finding himself
alone with Charlotte, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had not been guilty of that inconsequence.
Not to be flurried was the kind of consistency he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wanted, just as
consistency was the kind of dignity. And why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) have dignity
when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had so much of the good conscience, as it were, on which such
advantages rested? He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had done nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) oughtn't--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had in fact
done nothing at all. Once more, as a man conscious of having known many
women, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could assist, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have called it, at the recurrent,
the predestined phenomenon, the thing always as certain as sunrise or
the coming round of Saints' days, the doing by the woman of the thing
that gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) away. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did it, ever, inevitably, infallibly--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
couldn't possibly not do it. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nature, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life, and the
man could always expect it without lifting a finger. This was HIS (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the
man's, any man's, position and strength--that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had necessarily the
advantage, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only had to wait, with a decent patience, to be
placed, in spite of himself, it might really be said, in the right. Just
so the punctuality of performance on the part of the other creature
was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) weakness and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) deep misfortune--not less, no doubt, than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
beauty. It produced for the man that extraordinary mixture of pity and
profit in which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relation with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not a mere brute,
mainly consisted; and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in fact his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most pertinent ground of
being always nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), nice about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), nice FOR her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always
dressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) act up, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) muffled and disguised and arranged
it, showing in fact in these dissimulations a cleverness equal to but
one thing in the world, equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) abjection: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would let it be
known for anything, for everything, but the truth of which it was made.
That was what, precisely, Charlotte Stant would be doing now; that was
the present motive and support, to a certainty, of each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) looks and
motions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) was the twentieth woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) was possessed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) doom, but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) doom was also to arrange appearances, and what now concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
to learn how she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) proposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would help her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>), would arrange WITH her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) to
any point in reason; the only thing was to know what appearance could
best be produced and best be preserved. Produced and preserved on her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)
part of course; since on his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own there had been luckily no folly to
cover up, nothing but a perfect accord between conduct and obligation.

<p/>They stood there together, at all events, when the door had closed
behind their friend, with a conscious, strained smile and very much as
if each waited for the other to strike the note or give the pitch. The
young man held himself, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) silent suspense--only not more afraid
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) own fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) was afraid of herself, however;
whereas, to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gain of lucidity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was afraid only of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>). Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)
throw herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, or would she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) be otherwise wonderful? She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)
would see what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do--so their queer minute without words told
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) would act accordingly. But what could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do but just let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) see that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make anything, everything, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>), as honourably
easy as possible? Even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) should throw herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would make that easy--easy, that is, to overlook, to ignore, not to
remember, and not, by the same token, either, to regret. This was not
what in fact happened, though it was also not at a single touch, but by
the finest gradations, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tension subsided. <div class="bookquote">``It's too delightful
to be back!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) said at last; and it was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) definitely gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--being moreover nothing but what anyone else might have said. Yet
with two or three other things that, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) response, followed it, it
quite pointed the path, while the tone of it, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) whole attitude,
were as far removed as need have been from the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) situation.
The abjection that was present to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as of the essence quite failed to
peep out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon enough saw that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) was arranging she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) could be
trusted to arrange. Good--it was all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked; and all the more that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could admire and like her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) for it.

<p/>The particular appearance she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) would, as they said, go in for was that
of having no account whatever to give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--it would be in fact that of
having none to give anybody--of reasons or of motives, of comings or of
goings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) was a charming young woman who had met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)
was also a charming young woman with a life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) would take
it high--up, up, up, ever so high. Well then, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do the same; no
height would be too great for them, not even the dizziest conceivable
to a young person so subtle. The dizziest seemed indeed attained when,
after another moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) came as near as she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) was to come to an apology
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) abruptness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been thinking of Maggie, and at last I yearned for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). I wanted

I SHALL.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s happy, thank God! Only it's almost terrible, you know,

you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) returned with gravity, <div class="bookquote">``I feel that I've still much to learn
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) subjoined <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll rejoice awfully in your being
with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you don't need me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte smiled. <div class="bookquote">``It's her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hour. It's a great
hour. One has seen often enough, with girls, what it is. But that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``is exactly why. Why I've wanted, I mean, not to miss it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) bent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a kind, comprehending face. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't miss anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had got it, the pitch, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could keep it now, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
needed was to have it given him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). The pitch was the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife
that was to be--the sight of that happiness as a joy for an old friend.
It was, yes, magnificent, and not the less so for its coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),
suddenly, as sincere, as nobly exalted. Something in Charlotte's eyes
seemed to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) this, seemed to plead with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in advance as to
what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was to find in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was eager--and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tried to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) that
too--to find what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) liked; mindful as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) easily could be of what the
friendship had been for Maggie. It had been armed with the wings of
young imagination, young generosity; it had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) believed--always
counting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) intense devotion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father--the liveliest emotion
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had known before the dawn of the sentiment inspired by himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had not, to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knowledge, invited the object of it to their wedding,
had not thought of proposing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), for a matter of a couple of hours,
an arduous and expensive journey. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) connected and
informed, from week to week, in spite of preparations and absorptions.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I've been writing to Charlotte--I wish you knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) better:''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
could still hear, from recent weeks, this record of the fact, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
could still be conscious, not otherwise than queerly, of the gratuitous
element in Maggie's wish, which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had failed as yet to indicate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).
Older and perhaps more intelligent, at any rate, why shouldn't Charlotte
respond--and be quite FREE to respond--to such fidelities with something
more than mere formal good manners? The relations of women with each
other were of the strangest, it was true, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) probably wouldn't
have trusted here a young person of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own race. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was proceeding
throughout on the ground of the immense difference--difficult indeed as
it might have been to disembroil in this young person HER race-quality.
Nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) definitely placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was a rare, a special product.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) singleness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) solitude, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) want of means, that is her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) want of
ramifications and other advantages, contributed to enrich her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) somehow
with an odd, precious neutrality, to constitute for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), so detached
yet so aware, a sort of small social capital. It was the only one she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had--it was the only one a lonely, gregarious girl COULD have, since
few, surely, had in anything like the same degree arrived at it, and
since this one indeed had compassed it but through the play of some gift
of nature to which you could scarce give a definite name.

<p/>It wasn't a question of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) strange sense for tongues, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
juggled as a conjuror at a show juggled with balls or hoops or lighted
brands--it wasn't at least entirely that, for he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had known people
almost as polyglot whom their accomplishment had quite failed to make
interesting. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was polyglot himself, for that matter--as was the case
too with so many of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) friends and relations; for none of whom, more
than for himself, was it anything but a common convenience. The point
was that in this young woman it was a beauty in itself, and almost a
mystery: so, certainly, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had more than once felt in noting, on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
lips, that rarest, among the Barbarians, of all civil graces, a perfect
felicity in the use of Italian. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had known strangers--a few, and
mostly men--who spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own language agreeably; but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had known
neither man nor woman who showed for it Charlotte's almost mystifying
instinct. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) remembered how, from the first of their acquaintance,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had made no display of it, quite as if English, between them, his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
English so matching with hers, were their inevitable medium. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had
perceived all by accident--by hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) talk before him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to somebody
else that they had an alternative as good; an alternative in fact as
much better as the amusement for him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was greater in watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for the
slips that never came. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) account of the mystery didn't suffice: her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
recall of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) birth in Florence and Florentine childhood; her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) parents,
from the great country, but themselves already of a corrupt generation,
demoralised, falsified, polyglot well before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), with the Tuscan balia
who was her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) first remembrance; the servants of the villa, the dear
contadini of the poder, the little girls and the other peasants of
the next podere, all the rather shabby but still ever so pretty human
furniture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) early time, including the good sisters of the poor
convent of the Tuscan hills, the convent shabbier than almost anything
else, but prettier too, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been kept at school till the
subsequent phase, the phase of the much grander institution in Paris at
which Maggie was to arrive, terribly frightened, and as a smaller
girl, three years before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own ending of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) period of five. Such
reminiscences, naturally, gave a ground, but they had not prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
from insisting that some strictly civil ancestor--generations back, and
from the Tuscan hills if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would-made himself felt, ineffaceably, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blood and in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew nothing of the ancestor, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>ancestor</b></font>) theory from him (<font color='blue'><b>ancestor</b></font>), gracefully enough, as one of the little
presents that make friendship flourish. These matters, however, all
melted together now, though a sense of them was doubtless concerned,
not unnaturally, in the next thing, of the nature of a surmise, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>ancestor</b></font>) discretion let him (<font color='blue'><b>ancestor</b></font>) articulate. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't, I rather gather,
particularly liked your country?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They would stick, for the time, to
their English.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't, I fear, seem particularly mine. And it doesn't in the least
matter, over there, whether one likes it or not--that is to anyone but
one's self. But I didn't like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte Stant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not encouraging then to me, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean because you're going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, of course we're going. I've wanted immensely to go.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)
hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``But now?--immediately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a month or two--it seems to be the new idea.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>On which there was
something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) face--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) imagined--that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) say: <div class="bookquote">``Didn't Maggie
write to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not of your going at once. But of course you must go. And of course you
must stay'' (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>--Charlotte was easily clear--<div class="bookquote">``as long as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that what you did?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``You stayed as long as possible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it seemed to me so--but I hadn't `interests.' You'll have
them--on a great scale. It's the country for interests,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.
<div class="bookquote">``If I had only had a few I doubtless wouldn't have left it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) waited an instant; they were still on their feet. <div class="bookquote">``Yours then are
rather here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mine!'' (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>--the girl smiled. <div class="bookquote">``They take up little room, wherever they
are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It determined in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), the way this came from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and what it somehow
did for her-it determined in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) a speech that would have seemed a few
minutes before precarious and in questionable taste. The lead she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) made the difference, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) felt it as really a lift on
finding an honest and natural word rise, by its license, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) lips.
Nothing surely could be, for both of them, more in the note of a high
bravery. <div class="bookquote">``I've been thinking it all the while so probable, you know,
that you would have seen your way to marrying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) an instant, and, just for these seconds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) feared for
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might have spoiled. <div class="bookquote">``To marrying whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, some good, kind, clever, rich American.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) security hung in the balance--then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) felt,
admirable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tried everyone I came across. I did my best. I showed I had come,
quite publicly, FOR that. Perhaps I showed it too much. At any rate
it was no use. I had to recognise it. No one would have me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to show as sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) having to hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) anything so
disconcerting. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pitied his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) feeling about it; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was disappointed
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``Existence, you know, all the same, doesn't
depend on that. I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``on having caught a husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--existence!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince vaguely commented. <div class="bookquote">``You think I ought to
argue for more than mere existence?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why MY
existence--even reduced as much as you like to being merely mine--should
be so impossible. There are things, of sorts, I should be able to
have--things I should be able to be. The position of a single woman
to-day is very favourable, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Favourable to what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, just TO existence--which may contain, after all, in one way
and another, so much. It may contain, at the worst, even affections;
affections in fact quite particularly; fixed, that is, on one's friends.
I'm extremely fond of Maggie, for instance--I quite adore her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). How
could I adore her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) more if I were married to one of the people you speak
of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince gave a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You might adore HIM more--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but it isn't, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``a question of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``it's always a question of doing the best
for one's self one can--without injury to others.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) felt by this time
that they were indeed on an excellent basis; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) went on again, as
if to show frankly his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) sense of its firmness. <div class="bookquote">``I venture therefore to
repeat my hope that you'll marry some capital fellow; and also to repeat
my belief that such a marriage will be more favourable to you, as you
call it, than even the spirit of the age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) at first only for answer, and would have appeared to
take it with meekness had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not perhaps appeared a little more to
take it with gaiety. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) simply said; but at that
moment their friend was with them again. It was undeniable that, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
came in, Mrs. Assingham looked, with a certain smiling sharpness, from
one of them to the other; the perception of which was perhaps what led
Charlotte, for reassurance, to pass the question on. <div class="bookquote">``The Prince hopes
so much I shall still marry some good person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Whether it worked for Mrs. Assingham or not, the Prince was himself, at
this, more than ever reassured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was SAFE, in a word--that was what it
all meant; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had required to be safe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was really safe enough for
almost any joke. <div class="bookquote">``It's only,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) explained to their hostess, <div class="bookquote">``because
of what Miss Stant has been telling me. Don't we want to keep up her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
courage?''  (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div>If the joke was broad he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had at least not begun it--not, that
is, AS a joke; which was what his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) companion's address to their friend
made of it. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has been trying in America, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says, but hasn't
brought it off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>The tone was somehow not what Mrs. Assingham had expected, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) made
the best of it. <div class="bookquote">``Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) replied to the young man, <div class="bookquote">``if you take
such an interest you must bring it off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you must help, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>Charlotte said unperturbed--<div class="bookquote">``as you've
helped, so beautifully, in such things before.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>With which, before Mrs.
Assingham could meet the appeal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had addressed herself to the Prince
on a matter much nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``YOUR marriage is on Friday?--on
Saturday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, on Friday, no! For what do you take us? There's not a vulgar
omen we're neglecting. On Saturday, please, at the Oratory, at three
o’clock--before twelve assistants exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twelve including ME?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``You'll make the thirteenth. It won't do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``if you're going in for `omens.' Should you like
me to stay away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear no--we'll manage. We'll make the round number--we'll have in some
old woman. They must keep them there for that, don't they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham's return had at last indicated for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) departure; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
had possessed himself again of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hat and approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to take leave.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had another word for Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">``I dine to-night with Mr. Verver.
Have you any message?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl seemed to wonder a little. <div class="bookquote">``For Mr. Verver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For Maggie--about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seeing you early. That, I know, is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll come early--thanks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll send for you. I mean send a carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't require that, thanks. I can go, for a penny, can't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
asked of Mrs. Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``in an omnibus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>said the Prince while Mrs. Assingham looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) blandly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, love--and I'll give you the penny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) shall get there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the good
lady added to their friend.

<p/>But Charlotte, as the latter took leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), thought of something
else. <div class="bookquote">``There's a great favour, Prince, that I want to ask of you. I
want, between this and Saturday, to make Maggie a marriage-present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man again soothingly exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I MUST,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``It's really almost for that I came back.
It was impossible to get in America what I wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham showed anxiety. <div class="bookquote">``What is it then, dear, you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>But the girl looked only at their companion. <div class="bookquote">``That's what the Prince, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)'ll be so good, must help me to decide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't _I_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham asked, <div class="bookquote">``help you to decide?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, darling, we must talk it well over.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) eyes
on the Prince. <div class="bookquote">``But I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) kindly will, to go with me to
look. I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to judge with me and choose. That, if you can spare the
hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is the great favour I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyebrows at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wonderfully smiled. <div class="bookquote">``What you came
back from America to ask? Ah, certainly then, I must find the hour!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
wonderfully smiled, but it was rather more, after all, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had been
reckoning with. It went somehow so little with the rest that, directly,
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), it wasn't the note of safety; it preserved this character, at
the best, but by being the note of publicity. Quickly, quickly, however,
the note of publicity struck him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) as better than any other. In another
moment even it seemed positively what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wanted; for what so much as
publicity put their relation on the right footing? By this appeal to
Mrs. Assingham it was established as right, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) immediately showed
that such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) own understanding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Prince,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``you must find the hour!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And it was
really so express a license from her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), as representing friendly judgment,
public opinion, the moral law, the margin allowed a husband about to be,
or whatever, that, after observing to Charlotte that, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) come to
Portland Place in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would make a point of being there
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) and so, easily, arrange with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) about a time, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
departure with the absolutely confirmed impression of knowing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) put
it to himself, where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was. Which was what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had prolonged his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) visit
for. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could stay.



<p/>IV

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite see, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>Colonel Assingham said to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife the
night of Charlotte's arrival, <div class="bookquote">``I don't quite see, I'm bound to say,
why you take it, even at the worst, so ferociously hard. It isn't your
fault, after all, is it? I'll be hanged, at any rate, if it's mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>The hour was late, and the young lady who had disembarked at Southampton
that morning to come up by the <div class="bookquote">``steamer special,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady morning</b></font>)</div>and who had then
settled herself at an hotel only to re-settle herself a couple of hours
later at a private house, was by this time, they might hope, peacefully
resting from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exploits. There had been two men at dinner, rather
battered brothers-in-arms, of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own period, casually picked up by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
host the day before, and when the gentlemen, after the meal, rejoined
the ladies in the drawing-room, Charlotte, pleading fatigue, had already
excused herself. The beguiled warriors, however, had stayed till after
eleven--Mrs. Assingham, though finally quite without illusions, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said, about the military character, was always beguiling to old
soldiers; and as the Colonel had come in, before dinner, only in time
to dress, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had not till this moment really been summoned to meet
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) companion over the situation that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was now to learn, their
visitor's advent had created for them. It was actually more than
midnight, the servants had been sent to bed, the rattle of the wheels
had ceased to come in through a window still open to the August air, and
Robert Assingham had been steadily learning, all the while, what it
thus behoved him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to know. But the words just quoted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) presented
themselves, for the moment, as the essence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) spirit and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)
attitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) disengaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) would be damned if he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) didn't--they were
both phrases he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) repeatedly used--his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) responsibility. The simplest, the
sanest, the most obliging of men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) habitually indulged in extravagant
language. His (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wife had once told him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), in relation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) violence of
speech; that such excesses, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) part, made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) think of a retired
General whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had once seen playing with toy soldiers, fighting and
winning battles, carrying on sieges and annihilating enemies with little
fortresses of wood and little armies of tin. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's exaggerated
emphasis was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) box of toy soldiers, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) military game. It harmlessly
gratified in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) declining years, the military instinct; bad
words, when sufficiently numerous and arrayed in their might, could
represent battalions, squadrons, tremendous cannonades and glorious
charges of cavalry. It was natural, it was delightful--the romance, and
for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as well, of camp life and of the perpetual booming of guns. It
was fighting to the end, to the death, but no one was ever killed.

<p/>Less fortunate than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), nevertheless, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wealth of
expression, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not yet found the image that described her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) favourite
game; all he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could do was practically to leave it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), emulating
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own philosophy. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had again and again sat up late to discuss those
situations in which her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) finer consciousness abounded, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had never
failed to deny that anything in life, anything of hers, could be a
situation for himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might be in fifty at once if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liked--and
it was what women did like, at their ease, after all; there always
being, when they had too much of any, some man, as they were well
aware, to get them out. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't at any price, have one, of any sort
whatever, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, or even be in one along with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
accordingly, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) favourite element, very much as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sometimes
watched, at the Aquarium, the celebrated lady who, in a slight, though
tight, bathing-suit, turned somersaults and did tricks in the tank of
water which looked so cold and uncomfortable to the non-amphibious. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion to-night, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last pipe,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) demonstration, quite as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had paid a
shilling. But it was true that, this being the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired the
value of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money. What was it, in the name of wonder, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so
bent on being responsible FOR? What did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretend was going to happen,
and what, at the worst, could the poor girl do, even granting she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
wanted to do anything? What, at the worst, for that matter, could she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) be
conceived to have in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) had told me the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) got here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham replied, <div class="bookquote">``I
shouldn't have my difficulty in finding out. But she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) wasn't so obliging,
and I see no sign at all of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) becoming so. What's certain is that
she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) didn't come for nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) wants'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) worked it out at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
leisure--<div class="bookquote">``to see the Prince again. THAT isn't what troubles me. I mean
that such a fact, as a fact, isn't. But what I ask myself is, What does
she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) want it FOR?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the good of asking yourself if you know you don't know?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div>The
Colonel sat back at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own ease, with an ankle resting on the other
knee and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) eyes attentive to the good appearance of an extremely
slender foot which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) kept jerking in its neat integument of fine-spun
black silk and patent leather. It seemed to confess, this member, to
consciousness of military discipline, everything about it being as
polished and perfect, as straight and tight and trim, as a soldier on
parade. It went so far as to imply that someone or other would have
<div class="bookquote">``got''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>something or other, confinement to barracks or suppression of
pay, if it hadn't been just as it was. Bob Assingham was distinguished
altogether by a leanness of person, a leanness quite distinct from
physical laxity, which might have been determined, on the part of
superior powers, by views of transport and accommodation, and which in
fact verged on the abnormal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``did''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>himself as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) friends
mostly knew, yet remained hungrily thin, with facial, with abdominal
cavities quite grim in their effect, and with a consequent looseness
of apparel that, combined with a choice of queer light shades and of
strange straw-like textures, of the aspect of Chinese mats, provocative
of wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) sources of supply, suggested the habit of tropic
islands, a continual cane-bottomed chair, a governorship exercised on
wide verandahs. His (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) smooth round head, with the particular shade of
its white hair, was like a silver pot reversed; his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) cheekbones and the
bristle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) moustache were worthy of Attila the Hun. The hollows of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) eyes were deep and darksome, but the eyes within them, were like
little blue flowers plucked that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) knew everything that could
be known about life, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) regarded as, for far the greater part, a
matter of pecuniary arrangement. His (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wife accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) of a want, alike,
of moral and of intellectual reaction, or rather indeed of a complete
incapacity for either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) never went even so far as to understand what
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) meant, and it didn't at all matter, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could be in spite
of the limitation a perfectly social creature. The infirmities, the
predicaments of men neither surprised nor shocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), and indeed--which
was perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) only real loss in a thrifty career--scarce even amused;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) took them for granted without horror, classifying them after their
kind and calculating results and chances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) might, in old bewildering
climates, in old campaigns of cruelty and license, have had such
revelations and known such amazements that he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had nothing more to
learn. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was wholly content, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) fondness, in domestic
discussion, for the superlative degree; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) kindness, in the oddest
way, seemed to have nothing to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) experience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could deal
with things perfectly, for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) needs, without getting near them.

<p/>This was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) dealt with his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wife, a large proportion of whose
meanings he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could neglect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) edited, for their general economy,
the play of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) edited, savingly, with the stump of a
pencil, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) redundant telegrams. The thing in the world that was least
of a mystery to him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) Club, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was accepted as perhaps
too completely managing, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) managed on lines of perfect
penetration. His (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) connection with it was really a master-piece of
editing. This was in fact, to come back, very much the process he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) might
have been proposing to apply to Mrs. Assingham's view of what was
now before them; that is to their connection with Charlotte Stant's
possibilities. They wouldn't lavish on them all their little fortune
of curiosity and alarm; certainly they wouldn't spend their cherished
savings so early in the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) liked Charlotte, moreover, who was a
smooth and compact inmate, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) felt as, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) instincts that
made against waste, much more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) own sort than his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could
talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) about Fanny almost better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could talk with Fanny
about Charlotte. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) made at present the best of the latter
necessity, even to the pressing of the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) has been noted as
having last uttered. <div class="bookquote">``If you can't think what to be afraid of, wait till
you can think. Then you'll do it much better. Or otherwise, if that's
waiting too long, find out from HER. Don't try to find out from ME. Ask
her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham denied, as we know, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) husband had a play of mind;
so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) side, treat these remarks only as if they
had been senseless physical gestures or nervous facial movements. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
overlooked them as from habit and kindness; yet there was no one to whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) talked so persistently of such intimate things. <div class="bookquote">``It's her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) friendship
with Maggie that's the immense complication. Because THAT,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) audibly
mused, <div class="bookquote">``is so natural.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why can't she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) have come out for it?''

in sympathy--no more were the people she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) saw. Then it's hideously dear;
she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) can't, on her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) means, begin to live there. Not at all as she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) can, in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you expect her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to stay over there all her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) days to oblige you?''

inconsequence: <div class="bookquote">``I'm too sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)--of course she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) can't enjoy it. But
I don't see what perversity rides her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) needn't have looked it all
so in the face--as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) doesn't do it, I suppose, simply for discipline.
It's almost--that's the bore of it--discipline to ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div>said Bob Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``that's what has been her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) idea. Take

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was far, however, from having done with it; it was a situation with
such different sides, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said, and to none of which one could, in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Between Charlotte and the Prince? Why, nothing--except their having to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do? They fell in love with each other--but, seeing it wasn't possible,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to begin with, that of their neither of them having the means

question of life and death. It wouldn't have been a bit amusing, either,
to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) as a pauper--I mean leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) one. That was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had--as HE (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had--the reason to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); there was a manner in it that half answered.

<p/>The echo, not loud but deep, filled for a little the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) seemed to
listen to it die away; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) began again. <div class="bookquote">``How are you sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) waited before saying, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) spoke it was definite. <div class="bookquote">``There
wasn't time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had a small laugh for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) reason; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) might have expected some other.
<div class="bookquote">``Does it take so much time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) herself, however, remained serious. <div class="bookquote">``It takes more than they had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was detached, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``What was the matter with their time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After which, as, remembering it all, living it over and piecing it

<p/>It brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) quickly to the point, and as if also in a measure to
answer herself. <div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it--THEN. But you surely recall,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) went

nothing to gain. That helps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``even a gentleman. It was I
who named Maggie to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)--a year from last May. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had never heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it's grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean grave for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that everything's grave for `you' is what we take for granted and
are fundamentally talking about. It's grave--it WAS--for Charlotte. And
it's grave for Maggie. That is it WAS--when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Or when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
did see HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't torment me as much as you would like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) presently went on,
<div class="bookquote">``because you think of nothing that I haven't a thousand times thought
of, and because I think of everything that you never will. It would
all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) recognised, <div class="bookquote">``have been grave if it hadn't all been right. You
can't make out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) contended, <div class="bookquote">``that we got to Rome before the end of
February.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) more than agreed. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing in life, my dear, that I CAN make
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, there was nothing in life, apparently, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), at real need,
couldn't. <div class="bookquote">``Charlotte, who had been there, that year, from early, quite
from November, left suddenly, you'll quite remember, about the 10th of
April. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to have stayed on--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to have stayed, naturally,
more or less, for us; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to have stayed all the more that the
Ververs, due all winter, but delayed, week after week, in Paris, were at
last really coming. They were coming--that is Maggie was--largely to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and above all to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) THERE. It was all altered--by
Charlotte's going to Florence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went from one day to the other--you
forget everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) reasons, but I thought it odd, at the
time; I had a sense that something must have happened. The difficulty
was that, though I knew a little, I didn't know enough. I didn't know
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) relation with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had been, as you say, a `near' thing--that is I
didn't know HOW near. The poor girl's departure was a flight--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went
to save herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had listened more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) showed--as came out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) tone. <div class="bookquote">``To save
herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, also, really, I think, to save HIM too. I saw it afterwards--I
see it all now. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would have been sorry--he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) didn't want to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I daresay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel laughed. <div class="bookquote">``They generally don't!''

had had simply to face it. Their marriage couldn't be, and, if that was
so, the sooner they put the Apennines between them the better. It had

had met more than was known--though it was a good deal known. More,
certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``than I then imagined--though I don't know what

than a year, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has done nothing to spoil it. And there are things he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
might have done--things that many men easily would. Therefore I believe
in him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), and I was right, at first, in knowing I was going to. So I
haven't'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stated it as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have quoted from a slate, after
adding up the items, the sum of a column of figures--<div class="bookquote">``so I haven't, I

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have? All their
case wants, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div>Bob Assingham declared, <div class="bookquote">``is that you should
leave it well alone. It's theirs now; they've bought it, over the

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of which case,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``are you speaking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) smoked a minute: then with a groan: <div class="bookquote">``Lord, are there so many?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Maggie's and the Prince's, and there's the Prince's and
Charlotte's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; and then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel scoffed, <div class="bookquote">``there's Charlotte's and the
Prince's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Maggie's and Charlotte's,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went on--<div class="bookquote">``and there's also
Maggie's and mine. I think too that there's Charlotte's and mine. Yes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mused, <div class="bookquote">``Charlotte's and mine is certainly a case. In short, you see,
there are plenty. But I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to keep my head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we to settle them all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) inquired, <div class="bookquote">``to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should lose it if things had happened otherwise--if I had acted
with any folly.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had gone on in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) earnestness, unheeding of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
question. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't be able to bear that now. But my good conscience
is my strength; no one can accuse me. The Ververs came on to Rome
alone--Charlotte, after their days with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in Florence, had decided
about America. Maggie, I daresay, had helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
a present, and a handsome one, so that many things were easy. Charlotte
left them, came to England, `joined' somebody or other, sailed for New
York. I have still her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) letter from Milan, telling me; I didn't know at
the moment all that was behind it, but I felt in it nevertheless the
undertaking of a new life. Certainly, in any case, it cleared THAT
air--I mean the dear old Roman, in which we were steeped. It left the
field free--it gave me a free hand. There was no question for me of
anybody else when I brought the two others together. More than that,
there was no question for them. So you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) concluded, <div class="bookquote">``where that
puts me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) got up, on the words, very much as if they were the blue
daylight towards which, through a darksome tunnel, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been pushing
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) way, and the elation in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) voice, combined with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) recovered
alertness, might have signified the sharp whistle of the train that
shoots at last into the open. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) turned about the room; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked out
a moment into the August night; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stopped, here and there, before the
flowers in bowls and vases. Yes, it was distinctly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had proved
what was needing proof, as if the issue of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) operation had been,
almost unexpectedly, a success. Old arithmetic had perhaps been
fallacious, but the new settled the question. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, oddly,
however, kept his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) place without apparently measuring these results.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been amused at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) intensity, so he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not uplifted by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
relief; his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) interest might in fact have been more enlisted than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
allowed. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presently asked, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) had already forgot
about Charlotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) faced round as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had touched a spring. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) WANTED to,
naturally--and it was much the best thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) could do.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was in
possession of the main case, as it truly seemed; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had it all now. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>)
was capable of the effort, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) took the best way. Remember too what
Maggie then seemed to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s very nice; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) always seems to me, more than anything else,
the young woman who has a million a year. If you mean that that's what
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) especially seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>), you of course place the thing in your
light. The effort to forget Charlotte couldn't, I grant you, have been
so difficult.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up but for an instant. <div class="bookquote">``I never said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) didn't from the
first--I never said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) doesn't more and more--like Maggie's money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said I shouldn't have liked it myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div>Bob Assingham returned.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) made no movement; he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) smoked another minute. <div class="bookquote">``How much did Maggie
know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seemed to consider--as if it were between quarts and
gallons--how best to express the quantity. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew what Charlotte, in
Florence, had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what had Charlotte told her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you so sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, this--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) explained a little what
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) meant. <div class="bookquote">``There are things, my dear--haven't you felt it yourself,
coarse as you are?--that no one could tell Maggie. There are things
that, upon my word, I shouldn't care to attempt to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel smoked on it. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'d be so scandalised?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'d be so frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'d be, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) strange little way, so hurt.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wasn't born to know evil. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must never know it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div>Bob Assingham had
a queer grim laugh; the sound of which, in fact, fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wife before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We're taking grand ways to prevent it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stood there to protest. <div class="bookquote">``We're not taking any ways. The ways are
all taken; they were taken from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) came up to our carriage
that day in Villa Borghese--the second or third of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) days in Rome,
when, as you remember, you went off somewhere with Mr. Verver, and the
Prince, who had got into the carriage with us, came home with us to tea.
They had met; they had seen each other well; they were in relation: the
rest was to come of itself and as it could. It began, practically, I
recollect, in our drive. Maggie happened to learn, by some other man's
greeting of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in the bright Roman way, from a streetcorner as we
passed, that one of the Prince's baptismal names, the one always used
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) among his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) relations, was Amerigo: which -LRB-as you probably don't
know, however, even after a lifetime of ME-RRB-, was the name, four hundred
years ago, or whenever, of the pushing man who followed, across the sea,
in the wake of Columbus and succeeded, where Columbus had failed, in
becoming godfather, or name-father, to the new Continent; so that the
thought of any connection with him (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) can even now thrill our artless
breasts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel's grim placidity could always quite adequately meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
wife's not infrequent imputation of ignorances, on the score of the land
of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) birth, unperturbed and unashamed; and these dark depths were even
at the present moment not directly lighted by an inquiry that managed to
be curious without being apologetic. <div class="bookquote">``But where does the connection come
in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife was prompt. <div class="bookquote">``By the women--that is by some obliging woman,
of old, who was a descendant of the pushing man, the make-believe
discoverer, and whom the Prince is therefore luckily able to refer to
as an ancestress. A branch of the other family had become great--great
enough, at least, to marry into his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); and the name of the navigator,
crowned with glory, was, very naturally, to become so the fashion among
them that some son, of every generation, was appointed to wear it. My
point is, at any rate, that I recall noticing at the time how the Prince
was, from the start, helped with the dear Ververs by his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wearing it.
The connection became romantic for Maggie the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took it in; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
filled out, in a flash, every link that might be vague. `By that sign,'
I quite said to myself, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)'ll conquer'--with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) good fortune, of
course, of having the other necessary signs too. It really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``was, practically, the fine side of the wedge. Which struck
me as also,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``a lovely note for the candour of the
Ververs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel took in the tale, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) comment was prosaic. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew,
Amerigo, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was about. And I don't mean the OLD one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what you mean!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife bravely threw off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The old one'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) pointed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) effect <div class="bookquote">``isn't the only discoverer in the
family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, as much as you like! If he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) discovered America--or got himself
honoured as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had--his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) successors were, in due time, to discover the
Americans. And it was one of them in particular, doubtless, who was to
discover how patriotic we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't this be the same one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel asked, <div class="bookquote">``who really
discovered what you call the connection?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) a look. <div class="bookquote">``The connection's a true thing--the connection's
perfectly historic, Your insinuations recoil upon your cynical mind.
Don't you understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``that the history of such people is
known, root and branch, at every moment of its course?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div>said Bob Assingham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to the British Museum,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion continued with spirit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what am I to do there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a whole immense room, or recess, or department, or whatever,
filled with books written about his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) family alone. You can see for
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen for YOUR self?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) faltered but an instant. <div class="bookquote">``Certainly--I went one day with Maggie. We
looked him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up, so to say. They were most civil.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fell again into
the current her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband had slightly ruffled. <div class="bookquote">``The effect was produced,
the charm began to work, at all events, in Rome, from that hour of the
Prince's drive with us. My only course, afterwards, had to be to make
the best of it. It was certainly good enough for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham
hastened to add, <div class="bookquote">``and I didn't in the least see my duty in making the
worst. In the same situation, to-day; I wouldn't act differently. I
entered into the case as it then appeared to me--and as, for the matter
of that, it still does. I LIKED it, I thought all sorts of good of it,
and nothing can even now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said with some intensity, <div class="bookquote">``make me think
anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing can ever make you think anything you don't want to,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the
Colonel, still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) chair, remarked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) pipe. <div class="bookquote">``You've got a
precious power of thinking whatever you do want. You want also, from
moment to moment, to think such desperately different things. What
happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``was that you fell violently in love with the
Prince yourself, and that as you couldn't get me out of the way you had
to take some roundabout course. You couldn't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), any more than
Charlotte could--that is not to yourself. But you could to somebody
else--it was always the Prince, it was always marriage. You could to
your little friend, to whom there were no objections.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not only there were no objections, but there were reasons, positive
ones--and all excellent, all charming.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) spoke with an absence of
all repudiation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) exposure of the spring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) conduct; and
this abstention, clearly and effectively conscious, evidently cost
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) nothing. <div class="bookquote">``It IS always the Prince; and it IS always, thank heaven,
marriage. And these are the things, God grant, that it will always be.
That I could help, a year ago, most assuredly made me happy, and it
continues to make me happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why aren't you quiet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I AM quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) colourless candour, still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) place; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
moved about again, a little, emphasising by her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) unrest her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) declaration
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) tranquillity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was as silent, at first, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
answer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was not to keep it long. <div class="bookquote">``What do you make of it that, by
your own show, Charlotte couldn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) all? What do you make of it
that the Prince didn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) anything? Say one understands that there
are things she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) can't be told--since, as you put it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is so easily
scared and shocked.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) produced these objections slowly, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
time, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) pauses, to stop roaming and come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
was roaming still when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) inquiry. <div class="bookquote">``If there hadn't been

the world was what there HAD been too bad to be spoken of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham, after this question, continued still to circulate--not
directly meeting it even when at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you wanted me to be quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I do--and I'm trying to make you so much so that you won't worry
more. Can't you be quiet on THAT?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) thought a moment--then seemed to try. <div class="bookquote">``To relate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had to
`bolt' for the reasons we speak of, even though the bolting had done for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wished--THAT I can perfectly feel Charlotte's not wanting
to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then, if it HAS done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wished-!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>But the Colonel's
conclusion hung by the <div class="bookquote">``if''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>which his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife didn't take up. So it hung
but the longer when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) presently spoke again. <div class="bookquote">``All one wonders, in that
case, is why then she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hasn't come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). Not really to HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll say anything you like. But that won't do me the same good as your
saying it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, my dear, will do you good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham returned. <div class="bookquote">``You
don't care for anything in itself; you care for nothing but to be
grossly amused because I don't keep washing my hands--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought your whole argument was that everything is so right that this
is precisely what you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife, as it was a point she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had often made, could go on as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had gone on before. ``You're perfectly indifferent, really; you're
perfectly immoral. You've taken part in the sack of cities, and I'm sure
you've done dreadful things yourself. But I DON'T trouble my head, if
you like. `So now there!''' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) laugh, but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) way. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I back poor
Charlotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Back' her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then, so do I. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) does know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wants.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Assingham
produced this quantity, at last, on the girl's behalf, as the ripe
result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) late wanderings and musings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had groped through
their talk, for the thread, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had got it. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wants to be
magnificent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel almost cynically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wants'' (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>--his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife now had it fast <div class="bookquote">``to be thoroughly superior, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s capable of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of wanting to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see Maggie through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob Assingham wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Through what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Through everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) KNOWS the Prince.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Maggie doesn't. No, dear thing'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>--Mrs. Assingham had to recognise
it--<div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doesn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that Charlotte has come out to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lessons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) continued, Fanny Assingham, to work out her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has done
this great thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). That is, a year ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) practically did it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) practically, at any rate, helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to do it himself--and helped me
to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) kept off, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stayed away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) free; and what,
moreover, were her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) silences to Maggie but a direct aid to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had spoken in Florence; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own poor story; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had,
come back at any time--till within a few weeks ago; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hadn't gone
to New York and hadn't held out there: if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hadn't done these things
all that has happened since would certainly have been different.
Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s in a position to be consistent now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knows the
Prince,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham repeated. It involved even again her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) former
recognition. <div class="bookquote">``And Maggie, dear thing, doesn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was high, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was lucid, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was almost inspired; and it was but
the deeper drop therefore to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) husband's flat common sense. <div class="bookquote">``In other
words Maggie is, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ignorance, in danger? Then if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s in danger,
there IS danger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There WON'T be--with Charlotte's understanding of it. That's where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)

<div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sees it--to become, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) best friend, an element of POSITIVE

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob Assingham looked at it hard. <div class="bookquote">``Which of them do you call her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) best

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave a toss of impatience. <div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you to discover!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But the

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and I. It's for us to be Charlotte's. It's for us, on our side, to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So we're to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We're to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). It will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham continued, <div class="bookquote">``the great
thing I can do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) made it out more and more. <div class="bookquote">``It will make up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make up for what?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said nothing, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) desire for

make up for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, if I did do either of them, by any chance, a wrong. If I made a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll make up for it by making another?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) again took

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One can never be ideally sure of anything. There are always

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, if we can but strike so wild, why keep meddling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) again look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Where would you have been, my dear, if I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that wasn't meddling--I was your own. I was your own,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, these people won't object. They are my own too--in the sense that

it. Therefore to see that Charlotte gets a good husband as soon as
possible--that, as I say, will be one of my ways of living. It will
cover,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said with conviction, <div class="bookquote">``all the ground.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then as his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own
conviction appeared to continue as little to match: <div class="bookquote">``The ground, I mean,
of any nervousness I may ever feel. It will be in fact my duty and I
shan't rest till my duty's performed.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had arrived by this time at
something like exaltation. <div class="bookquote">``I shall give, for the next year or two if
necessary, my life to it. I shall have done in that case what I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) took it at last as it came. <div class="bookquote">``You hold there's no limit to what you
`can'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say there's no limit, or anything of the sort. I say there are

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By after `all' you mean after she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s in love with somebody else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel put his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) question with a quietude doubtless designed to be
fatal; but it scarcely pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s not too much in love not
herself to want to marry. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would now particularly like to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told you so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet. It's too soon. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will. Meanwhile, however, I don't
require the information. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marrying will prove the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what truth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth of everything I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prove it to whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to myself, to begin with. That will be enough for me--to work
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). What it will prove,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham presently went on, <div class="bookquote">``will be
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s cured. That she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) accepts the situation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) paid this the tribute of a long pull at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) pipe. <div class="bookquote">``The situation of
doing the one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can that will really seem to cover her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tracks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), the good dry man, as if now at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was
merely vulgar. <div class="bookquote">``The one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can do that will really make new
tracks altogether. The thing that, before any other, will be wise and
right. The thing that will best give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chance to be magnificent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) slowly emitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) smoke. <div class="bookquote">``And best give you, by the same token,
yours to be magnificent with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be as magnificent, at least, as I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob Assingham got up. <div class="bookquote">``And you call ME immoral?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I'll call you stupid if you prefer. But stupidity pushed
to a certain point IS, you know, immorality. Just so what is morality
but high intelligence?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was unable to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); which left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
more definitely to conclude. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, it's all, at the worst, great
fun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you simply put it at THAT--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) implication was that in this case they had a common ground; yet even
thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) couldn't catch her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by it. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said from the
threshold, <div class="bookquote">``the fun that you mean. Good-night.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>In answer to which, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) turned out the electric light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) gave an odd, short groan, almost a
grunt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) HAD apparently meant some particular kind.



<p/>V

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now I must tell you, for I want to be absolutely honest.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>So
Charlotte spoke, a little ominously, after they had got into the Park.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't want to pretend, and I can't pretend a moment longer. You may
think of me what you will, but I don't care. I knew I shouldn't and I
find now how little. I came back for this. Not really for anything else.
For this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) repeated as, under the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tone, the Prince
had already come to a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For `this'?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) spoke as if the particular thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) indicated were
vague to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--or were, rather, a quantity that couldn't, at the most, be
much.

<p/>It would be as much, however, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should be able to make it. <div class="bookquote">``To have
one hour alone with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It had rained heavily in the night, and though
the pavements were now dry, thanks to a cleansing breeze, the August
morning, with its hovering, thick-drifting clouds and freshened air, was
cool and grey. The multitudinous green of the Park had been deepened,
and a wholesome smell of irrigation, purging the place of dust and of
odours less acceptable, rose from the earth. Charlotte had looked about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), with expression, from the first of their coming in, quite as if for
a deep greeting, for general recognition: the day was, even in the heart
of London, of a rich, low-browed, weatherwashed English type. It was as
if it had been waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew it, placed it, loved it,
as if it were in fact a part of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had come back for. So far as
this was the case the impression of course could only be lost on a mere
vague Italian; it was one of those for which you had to be, blessedly,
an American--as indeed you had to be, blessedly, an American for all
sorts of things: so long as you hadn't, blessedly or not, to remain
in America. The Prince had, by half-past ten--as also by definite
appointment--called in Cadogan Place for Mrs. Assingham's visitor, and
then, after brief delay, the two had walked together up Sloane Street
and got straight into the Park from Knightsbridge. The understanding
to this end had taken its place, after a couple of days, as inevitably
consequent on the appeal made by the girl during those first moments in
Mrs. Assingham's drawing-room. It was an appeal the couple of days
had done nothing to invalidate--everything, much rather, to place in a
light, and as to which, obviously, it wouldn't have fitted that anyone
should raise an objection. Who was there, for that matter, to raise
one, from the moment Mrs. Assingham, informed and apparently
not disapproving, didn't intervene? This the young man had asked
himself--with a very sufficient sense of what would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ridiculous. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasn't going to begin--that at least was certain--by
showing a fear. Even had fear at first been sharp in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), moreover,
it would already, not a little, have dropped; so happy, all round, so
propitious, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quite might have called it, had been the effect of this
rapid interval.

<p/>The time had been taken up largely by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) active reception of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
wedding-guests and by Maggie's scarce less absorbed entertainment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
friend, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had kept for hours together in Portland Place; whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had not, as wouldn't have been convenient, invited altogether as yet to
migrate, but who had been present, with other persons, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contingent,
at luncheon, at tea, at dinner, at perpetual repasts--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), had to reckon with so much eating--whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had looked in. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not again, till this hour, save for a minute,
seen Charlotte alone, so, positively, all the while, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not seen
even Maggie; and if, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not seen even Maggie, nothing was
more natural than that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouldn't have seen Charlotte. The exceptional
minute, a mere snatch, at the tail of the others, on the huge Portland
Place staircase had sufficiently enabled the girl to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--so
ready she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) assumed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be--of what they were to do. Time pressed if
they were to do it at all. Everyone had brought gifts; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relations
had brought wonders--how did they still have, where did they still find,
such treasures? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only had brought nothing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was ashamed; yet
even by the sight of the rest of the tribute she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wouldn't be put off.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would do what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, unknown to Maggie, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must
remember, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aid. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had prolonged the minute so far as
to take time to hesitate, for a reason, and then to risk bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
reason out. The risk was because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pride, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had that particular sort. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might as well be hurt one way as
another; and, besides, that particular sort of pride was just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hadn't. So his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slight resistance, while they lingered, had been just
easy enough not to be impossible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate to encourage you--and for such a purpose, after all--to spend
your money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had stood a stair or two below him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); where, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked up at
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beneath the high, domed light of the hall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rubbed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
palm the polished mahogany of the balustrade, which was mounted on fine
ironwork, eighteenth-century English. <div class="bookquote">``Because you think I must have
so little? I've enough, at any rate--enough for us to take our hour.

said, <div class="bookquote">``it isn't of course a question of anything expensive, gorged with
treasure as Maggie is; it isn't a question of competing or outshining.
What, naturally, in the way of the priceless, hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) got? Mine is to
be the offering of the poor--something, precisely, that--no rich person
COULD ever give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and that, being herself too rich ever to buy it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would therefore never have.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Charlotte had spoken as if after so
much thought. <div class="bookquote">``Only, as it can't be fine, it ought to be funny--and
that's the sort of thing to hunt for. Hunting in London, besides, is
amusing in itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recalled even how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) word. ```Funny'?'' ``Oh,
I don't mean a comic toy--I mean some little thing with a charm. But
absolutely RIGHT, in its comparative cheapness. That's what I call
funny,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had explained. ``You used,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had also added, <div class="bookquote">``to help me
to get things cheap in Rome. You were splendid for beating down. I have
them all still, I needn't say--the little bargains I there owed you.
There are bargains in London in August.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I don't understand your English buying, and I confess I find
it dull.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So much as that, while they turned to go up together, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
objected. <div class="bookquote">``I understood my poor dear Romans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was they who understood you--that was your pull,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``Our amusement here is just that they don't understand us. We can make
it amusing. You'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hesitated again it was because the point permitted. <div class="bookquote">``The
amusement surely will be to find our present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly--as I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if they don't come down--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we'll come up. There's always something to be done. Besides,
Prince,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had gone on, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not, if you come to that, absolutely a
pauper. I'm too poor for some things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had said--yet, strange as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was, lightly enough; <div class="bookquote">``but I'm not too poor for others.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
paused again at the top. <div class="bookquote">``I've been saving up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had really challenged it. <div class="bookquote">``In America?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, even there--with my motive. And we oughtn't, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
wound up, <div class="bookquote">``to leave it beyond to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>That, definitely, with ten words more, was what had passed--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feeling
all the while how any sort of begging-off would only magnify it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
might get on with things as they were, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must do anything rather
than magnify. Besides which it was pitiful to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) beg of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
WAS making her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had begged; and this, for a special sensibility in
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), didn't at all do. That was accordingly, in fine, how they had come
to where they were: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was engaged, as hard as possible, in the policy
of not magnifying. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had kept this up even on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) making a point--and
as if it were almost the whole point--that Maggie of course was not to
have an idea. Half the interest of the thing at least would be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
shouldn't suspect; therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was completely to keep it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--as
Charlotte on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side would--that they had been anywhere at all together
or had so much as seen each other for five minutes alone. The absolute
secrecy of their little excursion was in short of the essence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
appealed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kindness to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).
There had been something, frankly, a little disconcerting in such an
appeal at such an hour, on the very eve of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nuptials: it was one
thing to have met the girl casually at Mrs. Assingham's and another to
arrange with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) thus for a morning practically as private as their old
mornings in Rome and practically not less intimate. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had immediately
told Maggie, the same evening, of the minutes that had passed between
them in Cadogan Place--though not mentioning those of Mrs. Assingham's
absence any more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mentioned the fact of what their friend had
then, with such small delay, proposed. But what had briefly checked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
assent to any present, to any positive making of mystery--what had made
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), while they stood at the top of the stairs, demur just long enough
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) to notice it--was the sense of the resemblance of the little
plan before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to occasions, of the past, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite
disconnected, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could only desire to be. This was like
beginning something over, which was the last thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted. The
strength, the beauty of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) actual position was in its being wholly a
fresh start, was that what it began would be new altogether. These items
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) consciousness had clustered so quickly that by the time Charlotte
read them in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in presence of what they amounted to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had challenged them as soon as read them, had met them with a <div class="bookquote">``Do you
want then to go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>that had somehow made them ridiculous.
It had made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), promptly, fall back on minimizing it--that is on
minimizing <div class="bookquote">``fuss.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Apparent scruples were, obviously, fuss, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
on the spot clutched, in the light of this truth, at the happy principle
that would meet every case.

<p/>This principle was simply to be, with the girl, always simple--and with
the very last simplicity. That would cover everything. It had covered,
then and there, certainly, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediate submission to the sight of what
was clearest. This was, really, that what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked was little compared
to what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave. What she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave touched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) faced him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for it
was the full tune of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) renouncing. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) really renounced--renounced
everything, and without even insisting now on what it had all been for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only insistence was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) insistence on the small matter of
their keeping their appointment to themselves. That, in exchange for
<div class="bookquote">``everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>everything she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave up, was verily but a trifle. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let
himself accordingly be guided; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so soon assented, for enlightened
indulgence, to any particular turn she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might wish the occasion to take,
that the stamp of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) preference had been well applied to it even while
they were still in the Park. The application in fact presently required
that they should sit down a little, really to see where they were; in
obedience to which propriety they had some ten minutes, of a quality
quite distinct, in a couple of penny-chairs under one of the larger
trees. They had taken, for their walk, to the cropped, rain-freshened
grass, after finding it already dry; and the chairs, turned away from
the broad alley, the main drive and the aspect of Park Lane, looked
across the wide reaches of green which seemed in a manner to refine
upon their freedom. They helped Charlotte thus to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) position--her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
temporary position--still more clear, and it was for this purpose,
obviously, that, abruptly, on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) opportunity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sat down.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stood for a little before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), as if to mark the importance of not
wasting time, the importance she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) herself had previously insisted on; but
after she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had said a few words it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) not to resort
again to good-nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) marked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could, by this concession, that if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had finally met her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) first proposal for what would be <div class="bookquote">``amusing''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in
it, so any idea she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might have would contribute to that effect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had consequently--in all consistency--to treat it as amusing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
reaffirmed, and reaffirmed again, the truth that was HER truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care what you make of it, and I don't ask anything whatever of
you--anything but this. I want to have said it--that's all; I want not
to have failed to say it. To see you once and be with you, to be as we
are now and as we used to be, for one small hour--or say for two--that's
what I have had for weeks in my head. I mean, of course, to get it
BEFORE--before what you're going to do. So, all the while, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it was a question for me if I should
be able to manage it in time. If I couldn't have come now I probably
shouldn't have come at all--perhaps even ever. Now that I'm here I shall
stay, but there were moments, over there, when I despaired. It wasn't
easy--there were reasons; but it was either this or nothing. So I didn't
struggle, you see, in vain. AFTER--oh, I didn't want that! I don't
mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``that it wouldn't have been delightful to see you
even then--to see you at any time; but I would never have come for it.
This is different. This is what I wanted. This is what I've got. This is
what I shall always have. This is what I should have missed, of course,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``if you had chosen to make me miss it. If you had thought
me horrid, had refused to come, I should, naturally, have been immensely
`sold.' I had to take the risk. Well, you're all I could have hoped.
That's what I was to have said. I didn't want simply to get my time with
you, but I wanted you to know. I wanted you'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) kept it up, slowly,
softly, with a small tremor of voice, but without the least failure of
sense or sequence--<div class="bookquote">``I wanted you to understand. I wanted you, that is,
to hear. I don't care, I think, whether you understand or not. If I ask
nothing of you I don't--I mayn't--ask even so much as that. What you may
think of me--that doesn't in the least matter. What I want is that it
shall always be with you--so that you'll never be able quite to get rid
of it--that I DID. I won't say that you did--you may make as little of
that as you like. But that I was here with you where we are and as
we are--I just saying this. Giving myself, in other words, away--and
perfectly willing to do it for nothing. That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) paused as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) demonstration was complete--yet, for the moment,
without moving; as if in fact to give it a few minutes to sink in;
into the listening air, into the watching space, into the conscious
hospitality of nature, so far as nature was, all Londonised, all
vulgarised, with them there; or even, for that matter, into her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own open
ears, rather than into the attention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) passive and prudent friend.
His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) attention had done all that attention could do; his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) handsome,
slightly anxious, yet still more definitely <div class="bookquote">``amused''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>face sufficiently
played its part. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) clutched, however, at what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could best clutch
at--the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) off, definitely let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
off, it seemed, even from so much as answering; so that while he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) smiled
back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in return for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) information he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lips remain closed
to the successive vaguenesses of rejoinder, of objection, that rose for
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) from within. Charlotte herself spoke again at last--<div class="bookquote">``You may want to
know what I get by it. But that's my own affair.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) really didn't want
to know even this--or continued, for the safest plan, quite to behave as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) didn't; which prolonged the mere dumbness of diversion in which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had taken refuge. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was glad when, finally--the point she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had wished to
make seeming established to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) satisfaction--they brought to what might
pass for a close the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life at which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had had least to
say. Movement and progress, after this, with more impersonal talk, were
naturally a relief; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not again, during their excursion, at
a loss for the right word. The air had been, as it were, cleared; they
had their errand itself to discuss, and the opportunities of London,
the sense of the wonderful place, the pleasures of prowling there, the
question of shops, of possibilities, of particular objects, noticed by
each in previous prowls. Each professed surprise at the extent of the
other's knowledge; the Prince in especial wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) friend's
possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had rather prized his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own possession, the
guidance he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could really often give a cabman; it was a whim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own,
a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) Anglomania, and congruous with that feature, which had,
after all, so much more surface than depth. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) companion, with the
memory of other visits and other rambles, spoke of places he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hadn't
seen and things he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) didn't know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) actually felt again--as half the
effect--just a shade humiliated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might even have felt a trifle
annoyed--if it hadn't been, on this spot, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) being, even more,
interested. It was a fresh light on Charlotte and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) curious
world-quality, of which, in Rome, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) due sense, but
which clearly would show larger on the big London stage. Rome was, in
comparison, a village, a family-party, a little old-world spinnet for
the fingers of one hand. By the time they reached the Marble Arch it was
almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) were showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) a new side, and that, in fact, gave
amusement a new and a firmer basis. The right tone would be easy for
putting himself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hands. Should they disagree a little--frankly
and fairly--about directions and chances, values and authenticities, the
situation would be quite gloriously saved. They were none the less,
as happened, much of one mind on the article of their keeping clear of
resorts with which Maggie would be acquainted. Charlotte recalled it
as a matter of course, named it in time as a condition--they would keep
away from any place to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had already been with Maggie.

<p/>This made indeed a scant difference, for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had during the last
month done few things so much as attend his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) future wife on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) making
of purchases, the antiquarii, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) called them with Charlotte, had not
been the great affair. Except in Bond Street, really, Maggie had had
no use for them: her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) situation indeed, in connection with that order of
traffic, was full of consequences produced by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's. Mr. Verver,
one of the great collectors of the world, hadn't left his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter to
prowl for herself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had little to do with shops, and was mostly, as
a purchaser, approached privately and from afar. Great people, all over
Europe, sought introductions to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>); high personages, incredibly high,
and more of them than would ever be known, solemnly sworn as everyone
was, in such cases, to discretion, high personages made up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) as
the one man on the short authentic list likely to give the price. It had
therefore been easy to settle, as they walked, that the tracks of
the Ververs, daughter's as well as father's, were to be avoided; the
importance only was that their talk about it led for a moment to
the first words they had as yet exchanged on the subject of Maggie.
Charlotte, still in the Park, proceeded to them--for it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) who
began--with a serenity of appreciation that was odd, certainly, as a
sequel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) words of ten minutes before. This was another note on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have called another light--for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion, who,
though without giving a sign, admired, for what it was, the simplicity
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) transition, a transition that took no trouble either to trace or
to explain itself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) paused again an instant, on the grass, to make
it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stopped before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with a sudden <div class="bookquote">``Anything of course, dear as
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is, will do for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I mean if I were to give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a pin-cushion from
the Baker-Street Bazaar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's exactly what _I_ meant'' (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>--the Prince laughed out this allusion to
their snatch of talk in Portland Place. <div class="bookquote">``It's just what I suggested.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) took, however, no notice of the reminder; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own
way. <div class="bookquote">``But it isn't a reason. In that case one would never do anything
for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte explained, <div class="bookquote">``if one took advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) character?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We mustn't take advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) character,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl, again unheeding,
pursued. <div class="bookquote">``One mustn't, if not for HER, at least for one's self. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
saves one such trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had spoken thoughtfully, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend's; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might
have been talking, preoccupied and practical, of someone with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
was comparatively unconnected. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) certainly GIVES one no trouble,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>said the Prince. And then as if this were perhaps ambiguous or
inadequate: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s not selfish--God forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!--enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte instantly said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s not selfish
enough. There's nothing, absolutely, that one NEED do for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s
so modest,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) developed--<div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) doesn't miss things. I mean if you love
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--or, rather, I should say, if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loves you. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lets it go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince frowned a little--as a tribute, after all, to seriousness.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lets what--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything--anything that you might do and that you don't. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lets
everything go but her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own disposition to be kind to you. It's of herself
that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asks efforts--so far as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ever HAS to ask them. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hasn't,
much. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does everything herself. And that's terrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince had listened; but, always with propriety, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) didn't commit
himself. <div class="bookquote">``Terrible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, unless one is almost as good as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). It makes too easy terms for
one. It takes stuff, within one, so far as one's decency is concerned,
to stand it. And nobody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte continued in the same manner, <div class="bookquote">``is
decent enough, good enough, to stand it--not without help from religion,
or something of that kind. Not without prayer and fasting--that is
without taking great care. Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``such people as you and
I are not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince, obligingly, thought an instant. <div class="bookquote">``Not good enough to stand
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, not good enough not rather to feel the strain. We happen each, I
think, to be of the kind that are easily spoiled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend, again, for propriety, followed the argument. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't
know. May not one's affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) do something more for one's
decency, as you call it, than her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) own generosity--her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) own affection, HER
`decency'--has the unfortunate virtue to undo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, of course it must be all in that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) question, all the same, interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What
it comes to--one can see what you mean--is the way she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) believes in one.
That is if she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) believes at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's what it comes to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte Stant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) asked, almost soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``should it be terrible?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
couldn't, at the worst, see that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it's always so--the idea of having to pity people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not when there's also, with it, the idea of helping them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but if we can't help them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We CAN--we always can. That is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) competently added, <div class="bookquote">``if we care for
them. And that's what we're talking about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) on the whole assented. <div class="bookquote">``It comes back then to our absolutely
refusing to be spoiled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. But everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince laughed as they went on--<div class="bookquote">``all
your `decency,' I mean--comes back to that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) walked beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``It's just what _I_ meant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) then
reasonably said.



<p/>VI

<p/>The man in the little shop in which, well after this, they lingered
longest, the small but interesting dealer in the Bloomsbury street who
was remarkable for an insistence not importunate, inasmuch as it was
mainly mute, but singularly, intensely coercive--this personage fixed
on his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) visitors an extraordinary pair of eyes and looked from one to the
other while they considered the object with which he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) appeared mainly to
hope to tempt them. They had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) last, for their time was nearly
up; an hour of it at least, from the moment of their getting into a
hansom at the Marble Arch, having yielded no better result than the
amusement invoked from the first. The amusement, of course, was to have
consisted in seeking, but it had also involved the idea of finding;
which latter necessity would have been obtrusive only if they had found
too soon. The question at present was if they were finding, and they
put it to each other, in the Bloomsbury shop, while they enjoyed the
undiverted attention of the shopman. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was clearly the master, and
devoted to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) business--the essence of which, in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) conception,
might precisely have been this particular secret that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) possessed for
worrying the customer so little that it fairly made for their relations
a sort of solemnity. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had not many things, none of the redundancy of
<div class="bookquote">``rot''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>they had elsewhere seen, and our friends had, on entering, even
had the sense of a muster so scant that, as high values obviously
wouldn't reign, the effect might be almost pitiful. Then their
impression had changed; for, though the show was of small pieces,
several taken from the little window and others extracted from a
cupboard behind the counter--dusky, in the rather low-browed place,
despite its glass doors--each bid for their attention spoke, however
modestly, for itself, and the pitch of their entertainer's pretensions
was promptly enough given. His (<font color='blue'><b>entertainer</b></font>) array was heterogeneous and not at all
imposing; still, it differed agreeably from what they had hitherto seen.

<p/>Charlotte, after the incident, was to be full of impressions, of several
of which, later on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion--always in the interest of
their amusement--the benefit; and one of the impressions had been that
the man himself was the greatest curiosity they had looked at. The
Prince was to reply to this that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) himself hadn't looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); as,
precisely, in the general connection, Charlotte had more than once, from
other days, noted, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) advantage, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) consciousness of how, below
a certain social plane, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) never SAW. One kind of shopman was just like
another to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--which was oddly inconsequent on the part of a mind that,
where it did notice, noticed so much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) took throughout, always, the
meaner sort for granted--the night of their meanness, or whatever name
one might give it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), made all his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) cats grey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) didn't, no doubt,
want to hurt them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) imaged them no more than if his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes acted
only for the level of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own high head. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own vision acted for
every relation--this he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had seen for himself: she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) remarked beggars, she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
remembered servants, she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) recognised cabmen; she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had often distinguished
beauty, when out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), in dirty children; she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had admired <div class="bookquote">``type''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in
faces at hucksters' stalls. Therefore, on this occasion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had found
their antiquario interesting; partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) cared so for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
things, and partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) cared--well, so for them. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) likes his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
things--he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) loves them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was to say; <div class="bookquote">``and it isn't only--it isn't
perhaps even at all--that he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) loves to sell them. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) would love
to keep them if he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) could; and he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) prefers, at any rate, to sell them to
right people. We, clearly, were right people--he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) knows them when he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
sees them; and that's why, as I say, you could make out, or at least _I_
could, that he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) cared for us. Didn't you see'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was to ask it with an
insistence--<div class="bookquote">``the way he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) looked at us and took us in? I doubt if either
of us have ever been so well looked at before. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'ll remember
us'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was to profess herself convinced of that almost to uneasiness.
<div class="bookquote">``But it was after all'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--this was perhaps reassuring--<div class="bookquote">``because, given his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
taste, since he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) HAS taste, he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was pleased with us, he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was struck--he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
had ideas about us. Well, I should think people might; we're
beautiful--aren't we?--and he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) knows. Then, also, he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) way;
for that way of saying nothing with his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) lips when he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'s all the while
pressing you so with his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) face, which shows how he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) knows you feel
it--that is a regular way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the shopman fingers</b></font>)</div><p/>Of decent old gold, old silver, old bronze, of old chased and jewelled
artistry, were the objects that, successively produced, had ended by
numerously dotting the counter, where the shopman's slim, light fingers,
with neat nails, touched them at moments, briefly, nervously, tenderly,
as those of a chess-player rest, a few seconds, over the board, on a
figure he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) may move and then may not: small florid ancientries,
ornaments, pendants, lockets, brooches, buckles, pretexts for dim
brilliants, bloodless rubies, pearls either too large or too opaque
for value; miniatures mounted with diamonds that had ceased to dazzle;
snuffboxes presented to--or by--the too-questionable great; cups, trays,
taper-stands, suggestive of pawn-tickets, archaic and brown, that
would themselves, if preserved, have been prized curiosities. A few
commemorative medals, of neat outline but dull reference; a classic
monument or two, things of the first years of the century; things
consular, Napoleonic, temples, obelisks, arches, tinily re-embodied,
completed the discreet cluster; in which, however, even after tentative
reinforcement from several quaint rings, intaglios, amethysts,
carbuncles, each of which had found a home in the ancient sallow satin
of some weakly-snapping little box, there was, in spite of the due
proportion of faint poetry, no great force of persuasion. They looked,
the visitors, they touched, they vaguely pretended to consider, but
with scepticism, so far as courtesy permitted, in the quality of their
attention. It was impossible they shouldn't, after a little, tacitly
agree as to the absurdity of carrying to Maggie a token from such a
stock. It would be--that was the difficulty--pretentious without being
<div class="bookquote">``good'' (<font color='red'><b>the giver</b></font>)</div>; too usual, as a treasure, to have been an inspiration of the
giver, and yet too primitive to be taken as tribute welcome on any
terms. They had been out more than two hours and, evidently, had found
nothing. It forced from Charlotte a kind of admission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It ought, really, if it should be a thing of this sort, to take its
little value from having belonged to one's self.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ecco!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>said the Prince--just triumphantly enough. <div class="bookquote">``There you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dealer</b></font>)</div><p/>Behind the dealer were sundry small cupboards in the wall. Two or three
of these Charlotte had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) open, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes found themselves
resting on those he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had not visited. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) completed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) admission.
<div class="bookquote">``There's nothing here she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) could wear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>It was only after a moment that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``Is there
anything--do you think--that you could?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) just start. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't, at all events, look at the objects;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) but looked for an instant very directly at him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince quietly exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte asked, <div class="bookquote">``your idea to offer me something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, why not--as a small ricordo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But a ricordo of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of `this'--as you yourself say. Of this little hunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I say it--but hasn't my whole point been that I don't ask you to.
Therefore,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) demanded--but smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) now--<div class="bookquote">``where's the logic?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the logic--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But logic's everything. That, at least, is how I feel it. A ricordo
from you--from you to me--is a ricordo of nothing. It has no reference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) vaguely protested. Their entertainer, meanwhile, stood
there with his (<font color='blue'><b>entertainer</b></font>) eyes on them, and the girl, though at this minute more
interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) passage with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friend than in anything else, again
met his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gaze. It was a comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that their foreign tongue covered
what they said--and they might have appeared of course, as the Prince
now had one of the snuffboxes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hand, to be discussing a purchase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't refer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went on to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``_I_ refer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had lifted the lid of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) little box and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) looked into it hard. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you mean by that then that you would be free--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Free'--?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To offer me something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>This gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a longer pause, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke again she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have
seemed, oddly, to be addressing the dealer. <div class="bookquote">``Would you allow me--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>said the Prince into his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) little box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't accept it from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) repeated in the same way.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) exhaled a long breath that was like a guarded sigh. <div class="bookquote">``But you've
touched an idea that HAS been mine. It's what I've wanted.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
added: <div class="bookquote">``It was what I hoped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) box--this had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) made nothing, clearly,
of the little man's attention. <div class="bookquote">``It's what you brought me out for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``my own affair. But it won't
do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't do, cara mia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's impossible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's impossible.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) took up one of the brooches.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had another pause, while the shopman only waited. <div class="bookquote">``If I were to
accept from you one of these charming little ornaments as you suggest,
what should I do with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was perhaps at last a little irritated; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) even--as if HE (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might
understand--looked vaguely across at their host. <div class="bookquote">``Wear it, per Bacco!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where then, please? Under my clothes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wherever you like. But it isn't then, if you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``worth
talking about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only worth talking about, mio caro,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``from your having
begun it. My question is only reasonable--so that your idea may stand
or fall by your answer to it. If I should pin one of these things on
for you would it be, to your mind, that I might go home and show it to
Maggie as your present?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They had had between them often in talk the refrain, jocosely,
descriptively applied, of <div class="bookquote">``old Roman.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It had been, as a pleasantry,
in the other time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) explanation to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of everything; but nothing,
truly, had even seemed so old-Roman as the shrug in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) now
indulged. <div class="bookquote">``Why in the world not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--on our basis--it would be impossible to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) an account of
the pretext.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The pretext--?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wondered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The occasion. This ramble that we shall have had together and that
we're not to speak of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said after a moment <div class="bookquote">``I remember we're not to speak of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That of course you're pledged to. And the one thing, you see, goes with
the other. So you don't insist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had again, at random, laid back his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) trinket; with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) quite
turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), a little wearily at last--even a little impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't insist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It disposed for the time of the question, but what was next apparent
was that it had seen them no further. The shopman, who had not stirred,
stood there in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) patience--which, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) mute intensity helping, had
almost the effect of an ironic comment. The Prince moved to the glass
door and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) back to the others, as with nothing more to contribute,
looked--though not less patiently--into the street. Then the
shopman, for Charlotte, momentously broke silence. <div class="bookquote">``You've seen,
disgraziatamente, signora principessa,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) sadly said, <div class="bookquote">``too much'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and
it made the Prince face about. For the effect of the momentous came, if
not from the sense, from the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) words; which was that of
the suddenest, sharpest Italian. Charlotte exchanged with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend a
glance that matched it, and just for the minute they were held in check.
But their glance had, after all, by that time, said more than one thing;
had both exclaimed on the apprehension, by the wretch, of their intimate
conversation, let alone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) possible, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) impossible, title, and
remarked, for mutual reassurance, that it didn't, all the same, matter.
The Prince remained by the door, but immediately addressing the speaker
from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) stood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're Italian then, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But the reply came in English. <div class="bookquote">``Oh dear no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're English?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>To which the answer was this time, with a smile, in briefest Italian.
<div class="bookquote">``Che!''  (<font color='red'><b>The dealer</b></font>)</div>The dealer waived the question--he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) practically disposed of it by
turning straightway toward a receptacle to which he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) had not yet resorted
and from which, after unlocking it, he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) extracted a square box, of some
twenty inches in height, covered with worn-looking leather. He (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) placed
the box on the counter, pushed back a pair of small hooks, lifted the
lid and removed from its nest a drinking-vessel larger than a common
cup, yet not of exorbitant size, and formed, to appearance, either of
old fine gold or of some material once richly gilt. He (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) handled it with
tenderness, with ceremony, making a place for it on a small satin mat.
<div class="bookquote">``My Golden Bowl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) observed--and it sounded, on his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) lips, as if it
said everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) left the important object--for as <div class="bookquote">``important''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>it
did somehow present itself--to produce its certain effect. Simple, but
singularly elegant, it stood on a circular foot, a short pedestal with a
slightly spreading base, and, though not of signal depth, justified its
title by the charm of its shape as well as by the tone of its surface.
It might have been a large goblet diminished, to the enhancement of its
happy curve, by half its original height. As formed of solid gold it was
impressive; it seemed indeed to warn off the prudent admirer. Charlotte,
with care, immediately took it up, while the Prince, who had after a
minute shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) position again, regarded it from a distance.

<p/>It was heavier than Charlotte had thought. <div class="bookquote">``Gold, really gold?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
asked of their companion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Look a little, and perhaps you'll make out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looked, holding it up in both her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fine hands, turning it to the
light. <div class="bookquote">``It may be cheap for what it is, but it will be dear, I'm afraid,
for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, <div class="bookquote">``I can part with it for less than its value. I got
it, you see, for less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For how much then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited, always with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) serene stare. <div class="bookquote">``Do you like it then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``Do YOU like it?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came no nearer; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looked at their companion. <div class="bookquote">``Cos'e?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, signori miei, if you must know, it's just a perfect crystal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we must know, per Dio!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>said the Prince. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) turned away
again--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) glass door.

<p/>Charlotte set down the bowl; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was evidently taken. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean it's
cut out of a single crystal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it isn't I think I can promise you that you'll never find any joint
or any piecing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Even if I were to scrape off the gold?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) showed, though with due respect, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You couldn't
scrape it off--it has been too well put on; put on I don't know when and
I don't know how. But by some very fine old worker and by some beautiful
old process.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte, frankly charmed with the cup, smiled back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) now. <div class="bookquote">``A lost
art?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Call it a lost art,''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But of what time then is the whole thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, say also of a lost time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl considered. <div class="bookquote">``Then if it's so precious, how comes it to be
cheap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>interlocutor fire</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) interlocutor once more hung fire, but by this time the Prince
had lost patience. <div class="bookquote">``I'll wait for you out in the air,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
companion, and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) spoke without irritation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) pointed his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
remark by passing immediately into the street, where, during the next
minutes, the others saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) back to the shopwindow, philosophically
enough hover and light a fresh cigarette. Charlotte even took, a
little, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) time; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) funny Italian taste for London
street-life.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) host meanwhile, at any rate, answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) question. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I've had
it a long time without selling it. I think I must have been keeping it,
madam, for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've kept it for me because you've thought I mightn't see what's the
matter with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) only continued to face her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) only continued to appear to follow the
play of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``What IS the matter with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's not for me to say; it's for you honestly to tell me. Of course
I know something must be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if it's something you can't find out, isn't it as good as if it
were nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I probably SHOULD find out as soon as I had paid for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) host lucidly insisted, <div class="bookquote">``if you hadn't paid too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you call,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``little enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what should you say to fifteen pounds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte with the utmost promptitude, <div class="bookquote">``that it's
altogether too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>The dealer shook his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) head slowly and sadly, but firmly. <div class="bookquote">``It's my price,
madam--and if you admire the thing I think it really might be yours.
It's not too much. It's too little. It's almost nothing. I can't go
lower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte, wondering, but resisting, bent over the bowl again. <div class="bookquote">``Then
it's impossible. It's more than I can afford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man returned, <div class="bookquote">``one can sometimes afford for a present more
than one can afford for one's self.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said it so coaxingly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
found herself going on without, as might be said, putting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
place. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course it would be only for a present--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it would be a lovely one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does one make a present,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``of an object that contains, to
one's knowledge, a flaw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if one knows of it one has only to mention it. The good faith,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man smiled, <div class="bookquote">``is always there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And leave the person to whom one gives the thing, you mean, to discover
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wouldn't discover it--if you're speaking of a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not speaking of anyone in particular,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, whoever it might be. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might know--and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might try. But he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
wouldn't find.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as if, though unsatisfied, mystified, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) yet
had a fancy for the bowl. <div class="bookquote">``Not even if the thing should come to pieces?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was silent: <div class="bookquote">``Not even if he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should have to say to me `The
Golden Bowl is broken'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still silent; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strangest smile. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, if
anyone should WANT to smash it--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) laughed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) almost admired the little man's expression. <div class="bookquote">``You mean
one could smash it with a hammer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; if nothing else would do. Or perhaps even by dashing it with
violence--say upon a marble floor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, marble floors!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might have been thinking--for they were a
connection, marble floors; a connection with many things: with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) old
Rome, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); with the palaces of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) past, and, a little, of
hers; with the possibilities of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future, with the sumptuosities of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage, with the wealth of the Ververs. All the same, however,
there were other things; and they all together held for a moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
fancy. <div class="bookquote">``Does crystal then break--when it IS crystal? I thought its
beauty was its hardness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend, in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) way, discriminated. <div class="bookquote">``Its beauty is its BEING crystal.
But its hardness is certainly, its safety. It doesn't break,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went
on, <div class="bookquote">``like vile glass. It splits--if there is a split.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!'' (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>--Charlotte breathed with interest. <div class="bookquote">``If there is a split.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looked down again at the bowl. <div class="bookquote">``There IS a split, eh? Crystal does
split, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On lines and by laws of its own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean if there's a weak place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For all answer, after an hesitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took the bowl up again, holding
it aloft and tapping it with a key. It rang with the finest, sweetest
sound. <div class="bookquote">``Where is the weak place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) then did the question justice. <div class="bookquote">``Well, for ME, only the price. I'm
poor, you see--very poor. But I thank you and I'll think.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div>The Prince,
on the other side of the shop-window, had finally faced about and, as
to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hadn't done, was trying to reach, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes, the
comparatively dim interior. <div class="bookquote">``I like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``I want it. But I
must decide what I can do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The man, not ungraciously, resigned himself. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll keep it for
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The small quarter-of-an-hour had had its marked oddity--this she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt
even by the time the open air and the Bloomsbury aspects had again, in
their protest against the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gathered impression, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
more or less their own. Yet the oddity might have been registered as
small as compared to the other effect that, before they had gone much
further, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion, to take account of. This latter
was simply the effect of their having, by some tacit logic, some queer
inevitability, quite dropped the idea of a continued pursuit. They
didn't say so, but it was on the line of giving up Maggie's present
that they practically proceeded--the line of giving it up without
more reference to it. The Prince's first reference was in fact quite
independently made. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you satisfied yourself, before you had done,
of what was the matter with that bowl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No indeed, I satisfied myself of nothing. Of nothing at least but that
the more I looked at it the more I liked it, and that if you weren't so
unaccommodating this would be just the occasion for your giving me the
pleasure of accepting it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked graver for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), at this, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had looked all the morning.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you propose it seriously--without wishing to play me a trick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``What trick would it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) harder. <div class="bookquote">``You mean you really don't know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But know what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what's the matter with it. You didn't see, all the while?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) only continued, however, to stare. <div class="bookquote">``How could you see--out in the
street?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw before I went out. It was because I saw that I did go out. I
didn't want to have another scene with you, before that rascal, and I
judged you would presently guess for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) a rascal?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte asked. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) price is so moderate.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) waited
but a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Five pounds. Really so little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five pounds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) continued to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Five pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might have been doubting her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) word, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was only, it appeared,
gathering emphasis. <div class="bookquote">``It would be dear--to make a gift of--at five
shillings. If it had cost you even but five pence I wouldn't take it
from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``what IS the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it has a crack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It sounded, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) lips, so sharp, it had such an authority, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
almost started, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) colour, at the word, rose. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
had been right, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) assurance was wonderful. <div class="bookquote">``You answer for it
without having looked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did look. I saw the object itself. It told its story. No wonder it's
cheap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's exquisite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte, as if with an interest in it now made
even tenderer and stranger, found herself moved to insist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it's exquisite. That's the danger.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Then a light visibly came
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--a light in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend suddenly and intensely showed.
The reflection of it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own face. <div class="bookquote">``The
danger--I see--is because you're superstitious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Per Dio, I'm superstitious! A crack is a crack--and an omen's an omen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd be afraid--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Per Bacco!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For your happiness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For my happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For your safety?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For my safety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) just paused. <div class="bookquote">``For your marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For my marriage. For everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thought again. <div class="bookquote">``Thank goodness then that if there BE a crack we know
it! But if we may perish by cracks in things that we don't know--!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smiled with the sadness of it. <div class="bookquote">``We can never then give each other
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) considered, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) met it. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, but one does know. _I_ do, at
least--and by instinct. I don't fail. That will always protect me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was funny, the way he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said such things; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), really,
the more for it. They fell in for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) with a general, or rather with a
special, vision. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spoke with a mild despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What then will protect ME?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where I'm concerned _I_ will. From me at least you've nothing to fear,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) now quite amiably responded. <div class="bookquote">``Anything you consent to accept from
me--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, shall be perfect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) presently answered. <div class="bookquote">``It's vain, after all, for
you to talk of my accepting things when you'll accept nothing from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah, THERE, better still, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You attach an impossible
condition. That, I mean, of my keeping your gift so to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looked, before him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) there, at the condition--then,
abruptly, with a gesture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave it up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had a headshake of
disenchantment--so far as the idea had appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). It all appeared
too difficult. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my `condition'--I don't hold to it. You may cry it
on the housetops--anything I ever do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah well, then--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This made, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) laughed, all the difference.

<p/>But it was too late. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't care now! I SHOULD have liked the
Bowl. But if that won't do there's nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) considered this; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took it in, looking graver again; but after a
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) qualified. <div class="bookquote">``Yet I shall want some day to give you something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wondered at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The day you marry. For you WILL marry. You must--SERIOUSLY--marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) took it from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), but it determined in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) the only words she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
to have uttered, all the morning, that came out as if a spring had been
pressed. <div class="bookquote">``To make you feel better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) replied frankly, wonderfully--<div class="bookquote">``it will. But here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``is your hansom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had signalled--the cab was charging. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) put out no hand for their
separation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) prepared to get in. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did so, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
said what had been gathering while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) waited. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I would marry, I
think, to have something from you in all freedom.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div><p/>PART SECOND

<p/>VII

<p/>Adam Verver, at Fawns, that autumn Sunday, might have been observed to
open the door of the billiard-room with a certain freedom--might have
been observed, that is, had there been a spectator in the field. The
justification of the push he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) had applied, however, and of the push,
equally sharp, that, to shut himself in, he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) again applied--the ground
of this energy was precisely that he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) might here, however briefly, find
himself alone, alone with the handful of letters, newspapers and other
unopened missives, to which, during and since breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) had lacked
opportunity to give an eye. The vast, square, clean apartment was
empty, and its large clear windows looked out into spaces of terrace
and garden, of park and woodland and shining artificial lake, of
richly-condensed horizon, all dark blue upland and church-towered
village and strong cloudshadow, which were, together, a thing to create
the sense, with everyone else at church, of one's having the world to
one's self. We share this world, none the less, for the hour, with
Mr. Verver; the very fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) striking, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) would have said,
for solitude, the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) quiet flight, almost on tiptoe, through
tortuous corridors, investing him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) with an interest that makes our
attention--tender indeed almost to compassion--qualify his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) achieved
isolation. For it may immediately be mentioned that this amiable man
bethought himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal advantage, in general, only when it
might appear to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that other advantages, those of other persons, had
successfully put in their claim. It may be mentioned also that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always
figured other persons--such was the law of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature--as a numerous
array, and that, though conscious of but a single near tie, one
affection, one duty deepest-rooted in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, it had never, for many
minutes together, been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) portion not to feel himself surrounded
and committed, never quite been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) refreshment to make out where
the many-coloured human appeal, represented by gradations of tint,
diminishing concentric zones of intensity, of importunity, really faded
to the blessed impersonal whiteness for which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vision sometimes
ached. It shaded off, the appeal--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have admitted that; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had as yet noted no point at which it positively stopped.

<p/>Thus had grown in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a little habit--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) innermost secret, not confided
even to Maggie, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) understood it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) understood,
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) view, everything--thus had shaped itself the innocent trick of
occasionally making believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no conscience, or at least that
blankness, in the field of duty, did reign for an hour; a small game to
which the few persons near enough to have caught him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) playing it, and of
whom Mrs. Assingham, for instance, was one, attached indulgently that
idea of quaintness, quite in fact that charm of the pathetic, involved
in the preservation by an adult of one of childhood's toys. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took
a rare moment <div class="bookquote">``off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so with the touching, confessing eyes of
a man of forty-seven caught in the act of handling a relic of
infancy--sticking on the head of a broken soldier or trying the lock
of a wooden gun. It was essentially, in him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), the IMITATION of
depravity--which, for amusement, as might have been, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) practised
<div class="bookquote">``keeping up.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In spite of practice he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was still imperfect, for these so
artlessly-artful interludes were condemned, by the nature of the case,
to brevity. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had fatally stamped himself--it was his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) own fault--a
man who could be interrupted with impunity. The greatest of wonders,
moreover, was exactly in this, that so interrupted a man should ever
have got, as the phrase was, should above all have got so early, to
where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was. It argued a special genius; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was clearly a case of
that. The spark of fire, the point of light, sat somewhere in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inward
vagueness as a lamp before a shrine twinkles in the dark perspective of
a church; and while youth and early middle-age, while the stiff American
breeze of example and opportunity were blowing upon it hard, had made
of the chamber of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain a strange workshop of fortune. This
establishment, mysterious and almost anonymous, the windows of which,
at hours of highest pressure, never seemed, for starers and wonderers,
perceptibly to glow, must in fact have been during certain years the
scene of an unprecedented, a miraculous white-heat, the receipt for
producing which it was practically felt that the master of the forge
could not have communicated even with the best intentions.

<p/>The essential pulse of the flame, the very action of the cerebral
temperature, brought to the highest point, yet extraordinarily
contained--these facts themselves were the immensity of the result; they
were one with perfection of machinery, they had constituted the kind of
acquisitive power engendered and applied, the necessary triumph of all
operations. A dim explanation of phenomena once vivid must at all events
for the moment suffice us; it being obviously no account of the
matter to throw on our friend's amiability alone the weight of the
demonstration of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) economic history. Amiability, of a truth, is an
aid to success; it has even been known to be the principle of large
accumulations; but the link, for the mind, is none the less fatally
missing between proof, on such a scale, of continuity, if of nothing
more insolent, in one field, and accessibility to distraction in every
other. Variety of imagination--what is that but fatal, in the world of
affairs, unless so disciplined as not to be distinguished from
monotony? Mr. Verver then, for a fresh, full period, a period betraying,
extraordinarily, no wasted year, had been inscrutably monotonous
behind an iridescent cloud. The cloud was his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) native envelope--the soft
looseness, so to say, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) temper and tone, not directly expressive
enough, no doubt, to figure an amplitude of folds, but of a quality
unmistakable for sensitive feelers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was still reduced, in fine, to
getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) rare moments with himself by feigning a cynicism. His (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) real
inability to maintain the pretence, however, had perhaps not often been
better instanced than by his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) acceptance of the inevitable to-day--his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
acceptance of it on the arrival, at the end of a quarter-of-an hour, of
that element of obligation with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had all the while known he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) must
reckon. A quarter-of-an-hour of egoism was about as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>),
taking one situation with another, usually got. Mrs. Rance opened the
door--more tentatively indeed than he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) himself had just done; but on
the other hand, as if to make up for this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) pushed forward even more
briskly on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had been moved to do on seeing nobody.
Then, with force, it came home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had, definitely, a week
before, established a precedent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) at least that justice--it
was a kind of justice he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was always doing someone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had on the
previous Sunday liked to stop at home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had exposed himself
thereby to be caught in the act. To make this possible, that is, Mrs.
Rance had only had to like to do the same--the trick was so easily
played. It had not occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) to plan in any way for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>)
absence--which would have destroyed, somehow, in principle, the
propriety of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) own presence. If persons under his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) roof hadn't a right
not to go to church, what became, for a fair mind, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) own right?
His (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) subtlest manoeuvre had been simply to change from the library to
the billiard-room, it being in the library that his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) guest, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
daughter's, or the guest of the Miss Lutches--he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) scarce knew in which
light to regard her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)--had then, and not unnaturally, of course, joined
him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>). It was urged on him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) memory of the duration of the visit she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
had that time, as it were, paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), that the law of recurrence would
already have got itself enacted. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had spent the whole morning with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), was still there, in the library, when the others came back--thanks
to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) having been tepid about their taking, Mr. Verver and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), a
turn outside. It had been as if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) looked on that as a kind of
subterfuge--almost as a form of disloyalty. Yet what was it she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had in
mind, what did she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wish to make of him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had already made,
a patient, punctilious host, mindful that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had originally arrived
much as a stranger, arrived not at all deliberately or yearningly
invited?--so that one positively had her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) possible susceptibilities the
MORE on one's conscience. The Miss Lutches, the sisters from the middle
West, were there as friends of Maggie's, friends of the earlier time;
but Mrs. Rance was there--or at least had primarily appeared--only as a
friend of the Miss Lutches.

<p/>This lady herself was not of the middle West--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rather insisted on
it--but of New Jersey, Rhode Island or Delaware, one of the smallest and
most intimate States: he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) couldn't remember which, though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) insisted
too on that. It was not in him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--we may say it for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--to go so far as
to wonder if their group were next to be recruited by some friend of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own; and this partly because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), verily, rather
as wanting to get the Miss Lutches themselves away than to extend the
actual circle, and partly, as well as more essentially, because such
connection as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) enjoyed with the ironic question in general resided
substantially less in a personal use of it than in the habit of seeing
it as easy to others. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was so framed by nature as to be able to keep
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) inconveniences separate from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) resentments; though indeed if
the sum of these latter had at the most always been small, that was
doubtless in some degree a consequence of the fewness of the former. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
greatest inconvenience, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would have admitted, had he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) analyzed, was in
finding it so taken for granted that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had money, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had force.
It pressed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hard, and all round, assuredly, this attribution of
power. Everyone had need of one's power, whereas one's own need, at the
best, would have seemed to be but some trick for not communicating it.
The effect of a reserve so merely, so meanly defensive would in most
cases, beyond question, sufficiently discredit the cause; wherefore,
though it was complicating to be perpetually treated as an infinite
agent, the outrage was not the greatest of which a brave man might
complain. Complaint, besides, was a luxury, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreaded the
imputation of greed. The other, the constant imputation, that of
being able to <div class="bookquote">``do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>would have no ground if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't been, to start
with--this was the point--provably luxurious. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, somehow, were
closed--and by a spring connected moreover with the action of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes
themselves. The latter showed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had come out; quite at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hill of difficulty, the tall sharp
spiral round which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had begun to wind his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ascent at the age of twenty,
and the apex of which was a platform looking down, if one would, on
the kingdoms of the earth and with standing-room for but half-a-dozen
others.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, in any case, now saw Mrs. Rance approach with an instant
failure to attach to the fact any grossness of avidity of Mrs. Rance's
own--or at least to descry any triumphant use even for the luridest
impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) intensity. What was virtually supreme would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>)
vision of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) having attempted, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desertion of the library, to
mislead her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>)--which in point of fact barely escaped being what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
designed. It was not easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in spite of accumulations fondly and
funnily regarded as of systematic practice, not now to be ashamed; the
one thing comparatively easy would be to gloss over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) course. The
billiard-room was NOT, at the particular crisis, either a natural or a
graceful place for the nominally main occupant of so large a house to
retire to--and this without prejudice, either, to the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>)
visitor wouldn't, as he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) apprehended, explicitly make him (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) a scene. Should
she (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) frankly denounce him (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) for a sneak he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) would simply go to pieces; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) was, after an instant, not afraid of that. Wouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) rather, as
emphasising their communion, accept and in a manner exploit the anomaly,
treat it perhaps as romantic or possibly even as comic?--show at least
that they needn't mind even though the vast table, draped in brown
holland, thrust itself between them as an expanse of desert sand. She (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
couldn't cross the desert, but she (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) could, and did, beautifully get round
it; so that for him (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) to convert it into an obstacle he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) would have had
to cause himself, as in some childish game or unbecoming romp, to be
pursued, to be genially hunted. This last was a turn he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) was well aware
the occasion should on no account take; and there loomed before him (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>)--for
the mere moment--the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) fairly proposing that they should
knock about the balls. That danger certainly, it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) should
manage in some way to deal with. Why too, for that matter, had he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) need
of defences, material or other?--how was it a question of dangers really
to be called such? The deep danger, the only one that made him (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>), as
an idea, positively turn cold, would have been the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
seeking him (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) in marriage, of her (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) bringing up between them that terrible
issue. Here, fortunately, she (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was powerless, it being apparently so
provable against her (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had a husband in undiminished existence.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), it was true, only in America, only in Texas, in Nebraska,
in Arizona or somewhere--somewhere that, at old Fawns House, in the
county of Kent, scarcely counted as a definite place at all; it showed
somehow, from afar, as so lost, so indistinct and illusory, in the great
alkali desert of cheap Divorce. She (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) even in bondage, poor man,
had him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in contempt, had him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in remembrance so imperfect as barely to
assert itself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), none the less, in existence unimpeached:
the Miss Lutches had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the flesh--as they had appeared
eager to mention; though when they were separately questioned their
descriptions failed to tally. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be at the worst, should it come
to the worst, Mrs. Rance's difficulty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) served therefore quite
enough as the stout bulwark of anyone else. This was in truth logic
without a flaw, yet it gave Mr. Verver less comfort than it ought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
feared not only danger--he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) feared the idea of danger, or in other words
feared, hauntedly, himself. It was above all as a symbol that Mrs. Rance
actually rose before him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)--a symbol of the supreme effort that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) should
have sooner or later, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) felt, to make. This effort would be to say
No--he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) lived in terror of having to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) should be proposed to at a given
moment--it was only a question of time--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) should have to do
a thing that would be extremely disagreeable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) almost wished, on
occasion, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wasn't so sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) WOULD do it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) knew himself,
however, well enough not to doubt: he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) knew coldly, quite bleakly, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) would, at the crisis, draw the line. It was Maggie's marriage and
Maggie's finer happiness--happy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) before--that had
made the difference; he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) hadn't in the other time, it now seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>),
had to think of such things. They hadn't come up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), and it was as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), positively, had herself kept them down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had only been his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
child--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was indeed as much as ever; but there were sides on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had protected him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were more than a daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) knew--much, and blissfully, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) always HAD
known. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did at present more than ever, through having what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
called the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) life to make up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) for, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) situation
still, all the same, kept pace with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) activity--his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) situation being
simply that there was more than ever to be done.

<p/>There had not yet been quite so much, on all the showing, as since their
return from their twenty months in America, as since their settlement
again in England, experimental though it was, and the consequent sense,
now quite established for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), of a domestic air that had cleared and
lightened, producing the effect, for their common personal life,
of wider perspectives and large waiting spaces. It was as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
son-in-law's presence, even from before his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) becoming his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) son-in-law,
had somehow filled the scene and blocked the future--very richly and
handsomely, when all was said, not at all inconveniently or in ways not
to have been desired: inasmuch as though the Prince, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) measure now
practically taken, was still pretty much the same <div class="bookquote">``big fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>the sky
had lifted, the horizon receded, the very foreground itself expanded,
quite to match him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), quite to keep everything in comfortable scale. At
first, certainly, their decent little old-time union, Maggie's and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
own, had resembled a good deal some pleasant public square, in the heart
of an old city, into which a great Palladian church, say--something with
a grand architectural front--had suddenly been dropped; so that the rest
of the place, the space in front, the way round, outside, to the east
end, the margin of street and passage, the quantity of over-arching
heaven, had been temporarily compromised. Not even then, of a truth, in
a manner disconcerting--given, that is, for the critical, or at least
the intelligent, eye, the great style of the facade and its high place
in its class. The phenomenon that had since occurred, whether originally
to have been pronounced calculable or not, had not, naturally, been the
miracle of a night, but had taken place so gradually, quietly, easily,
that from this vantage of wide, wooded Fawns, with its eighty rooms, as
they said, with its spreading park, with its acres and acres of garden
and its majesty of artificial lake--though that, for a person
so familiar with the <div class="bookquote">``great''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>ones, might be rather ridiculous--no
visibility of transition showed, no violence of adjustment, in
retrospect, emerged. The Palladian church was always there, but the
piazza took care of itself. The sun stared down in his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) fulness, the air
circulated, and the public not less; the limit stood off, the way round
was easy, the east end was as fine, in its fashion, as the west,
and there were also side doors for entrance, between the two--large,
monumental, ornamental, in their style--as for all proper great
churches. By some such process, in fine, had the Prince, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
father-in-law, while remaining solidly a feature, ceased to be, at all
ominously, a block.

<p/>Mr. Verver, it may further be mentioned, had taken at no moment
sufficient alarm to have kept in detail the record of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) reassurance;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) would none the less not have been unable, not really have been
indisposed, to impart in confidence to the right person his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) notion of
the history of the matter. The right person--it is equally distinct--had
not, for this illumination, been wanting, but had been encountered in
the form of Fanny Assingham, not for the first time indeed admitted to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) counsels, and who would have doubtless at present, in any case, from
plenitude of interest and with equal guarantees, repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) secret.
It all came then, the great clearance, from the one prime fact that
the Prince, by good fortune, hadn't proved angular. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) clung to that
description of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) daughter's husband as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) often did to terms and
phrases, in the human, the social connection, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had found for
himself: it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) way to have times of using these constantly, as if
they just then lighted the world, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own path in it, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--even
when for some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) interlocutors they covered less ground. It was true
that with Mrs. Assingham he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) never felt quite sure of the ground anything
covered; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) disputed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) so little, agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) so much,
surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) with such systematic consideration, such predetermined
tenderness, that it was almost--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had once told her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) in irritation
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) were nursing a sick baby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) of not taking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) seriously, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had replied--as from her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) it couldn't frighten
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) religiously, adoringly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had laughed again,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had laughed before, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) producing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) that good right word
about the happy issue of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) connection with the Prince--with an effect
the more odd perhaps as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had not contested its value. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) couldn't of
course, however, be, at the best, as much in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) discovery as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was so much so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) fairly worked it--to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own
comfort; came in fact sometimes near publicly pointing the moral of what
might have occurred if friction, so to speak, had occurred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) pointed
it frankly one day to the personage in question, mentioned to the Prince
the particular justice he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) did him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), was even explicit as to the danger
that, in their remarkable relation, they had thus escaped. Oh, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
HAD been angular!--who could say what might THEN have happened? He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
spoke--and it was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had spoken to Mrs. Assingham too--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
grasped the facts, without exception, for which angularity stood.

<p/>It figured for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), clearly, as a final idea, a conception of the last
vividness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might have been signifying by it the sharp corners and
hard edges, all the stony pointedness, the grand right geometry of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
spreading Palladian church. Just so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was insensible to no feature of
the felicity of a contact that, beguilingly, almost confoundingly, was a
contact but with practically yielding lines and curved surfaces.
<div class="bookquote">``You're round, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had said--<div class="bookquote">``you're ALL, you're variously
and inexhaustibly round, when you might, by all the chances, have been
abominably square. I'm not sure, for that matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had added, <div class="bookquote">``that
you're not square in the general mass--whether abominably or not. The
abomination isn't a question, for you're inveterately round--that's
what I mean--in the detail. It's the sort of thing, in you, that one
feels--or at least I do--with one's hand. Say you had been formed, all
over, in a lot of little pyramidal lozenges like that wonderful side of
the Ducal Palace in Venice--so lovely in a building, but so damnable,
for rubbing against, in a man, and especially in a near relation. I can
see them all from here--each of them sticking out by itself--all the
architectural cut diamonds that would have scratched one's softer sides.
One would have been scratched by diamonds--doubtless the neatest way
if one was to be scratched at all--but one would have been more or less
reduced to a hash. As it is, for living with, you're a pure and perfect
crystal. I give you my idea--I think you ought to have it--just as it
has come to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The Prince had taken the idea, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) way, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was
well accustomed, by this time, to taking; and nothing perhaps even could
more have confirmed Mr. Verver's account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) surface than the manner
in which these golden drops evenly flowed over it. They caught in
no interstice, they gathered in no concavity; the uniform smoothness
betrayed the dew but by showing for the moment a richer tone. The young
man, in other words, unconfusedly smiled--though indeed as if assenting,
from principle and habit, to more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understood. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked all signs
that things were well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cared rather less WHY they were.

<p/>In regard to the people among whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had since his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage been
living, the reasons they so frequently gave--so much oftener than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
ever heard reasons given before--remained on the whole the element by
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most differed from them; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father-in-law and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife
were, after all, only first among the people among whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been
living. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was never even yet sure of how, at this, that or the other
point, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would strike them; they felt remarkably, so often, things he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hadn't meant, and missed not less remarkably, and not less often, things
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fallen back on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) general explanation--<div class="bookquote">``We haven't the
same values;''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>by which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understood the same measure of importance. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``curves''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>apparently were important because they had been unexpected,
or, still more, unconceived; whereas when one had always, as in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
relegated old world, taken curves, and in much greater quantities too,
for granted, one was no more surprised at the resulting feasibility of
intercourse than one was surprised at being upstairs in a house that had
a staircase. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had in fact on this occasion disposed alertly enough of
the subject of Mr. Verver's approbation. The promptitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) answer,
we may in fact well surmise, had sprung not a little from a particular
kindled remembrance; this had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) acknowledgment its easiest
turn. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if I'm a crystal I'm delighted that I'm a perfect one, for I
believe that they sometimes have cracks and flaws--in which case they're
to be had very cheap!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had stopped short of the emphasis it would
have given his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) joke to add that there had been certainly no having
HIM cheap; and it was doubtless a mark of the good taste practically
reigning between them that Mr. Verver had not, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) side either,
taken up the opportunity. It is the latter's relation to such aspects,
however, that now most concerns us, and the bearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) pleased view
of this absence of friction upon Amerigo's character as a representative
precious object. Representative precious objects, great ancient pictures
and other works of art, fine eminent <div class="bookquote">``pieces''  (<font color='red'><b>Representative</b></font>)</div>in gold, in silver, in
enamel, majolica, ivory, bronze, had for a number of years so multiplied
themselves round him (<font color='blue'><b>Representative</b></font>) and, as a general challenge to acquisition and
appreciation, so engaged all the faculties of his (<font color='blue'><b>Representative</b></font>) mind, that the
instinct, the particular sharpened appetite of the collector, had fairly
served as a basis for his (<font color='blue'><b>Representative</b></font>) acceptance of the Prince's suit.

<p/>Over and above the signal fact of the impression made on Maggie herself,
the aspirant to his (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) daughter's hand showed somehow the great marks and
signs, stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) with the high authenticities, he (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) had learned to
look for in pieces of the first order. Adam Verver knew, by this time,
knew thoroughly; no man in Europe or in America, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) privately believed,
was less capable, in such estimates, of vulgar mistakes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never
spoken of himself as infallible--it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way; but, apart from the
natural affections, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had acquainted himself with no greater joy, of
the intimately personal type, than the joy of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) originally coming
to feel, and all so unexpectedly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the spirit of
the connoisseur. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, like many other persons, in the course of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reading, been struck with Keats's sonnet about stout Cortez in the
presence of the Pacific; but few persons, probably, had so devoutly
fitted the poet's grand image to a fact of experience. It consorted so
with Mr. Verver's consciousness of the way in which, at a given moment,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had stared at HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) Pacific, that a couple of perusals of the immortal
lines had sufficed to stamp them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) memory. His (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``peak in Darien''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was the sudden hour that had transformed his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) life, the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
perceiving with a mute inward gasp akin to the low moan of apprehensive
passion, that a world was left him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) to conquer and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) might conquer
it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) tried. It had been a turning of the page of the book of
life--as if a leaf long inert had moved at a touch and, eagerly
reversed, had made such a stir of the air as sent up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) face the
very breath of the Golden Isles. To rifle the Golden Isles had, on
the spot, become the business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) future, and with the sweetness of
it--what was most wondrous of all--still more even in the thought than
in the act. The thought was that of the affinity of Genius, or at least
of Taste, with something in himself--with the dormant intelligence of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) had thus almost violently become aware and that affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) as
changing by a mere revolution of the screw his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) whole intellectual
plane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) was equal, somehow, with the great seers, the invokers and
encouragers of beauty--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) didn't after all perhaps dangle so far
below the great producers and creators. He (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) had been nothing of that kind
before-too decidedly, too dreadfully not; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) saw why he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) had been
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) had, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) had failed and fallen short even in huge success;
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) read into his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) career, in one single magnificent night, the
immense meaning it had waited for.

<p/>It was during his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) first visit to Europe after the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) wife,
when his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) daughter was ten years old, that the light, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) mind, had
so broken--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) had even made out at that time why, on an earlier
occasion, the journey of his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) honeymoon year, it had still been closely
covered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``bought''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>then, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) had been able, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) had
bought almost wholly for the frail, fluttered creature at his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) side, who
had had her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fancies, decidedly, but all for the art, then wonderful
to both of them, of the Rue de la Paix, the costly authenticities of
dressmakers and jewellers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) flutter--pale disconcerted ghost as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
actually was, a broken white flower tied round, almost grotesquely for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) present sense, with a huge satin <div class="bookquote">``bow''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>of the Boulevard--her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) flutter
had been mainly that of ribbons, frills and fine fabrics; all funny,
pathetic evidence, for memory, of the bewilderments overtaking them as a
bridal pair confronted with opportunity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) could wince, fairly, still,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) remembered the sense in which the poor girl's pressure had, under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) fond encouragement indeed, been exerted in favour of purchase and
curiosity. These were wandering images, out of the earlier dusk, that
threw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) pity, into a past more remote than he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) liked
their common past, their young affection, to appear. It would have had
to be admitted, to an insistent criticism, that Maggie's mother, all too
strangely, had not so much failed of faith as of the right application
of it; since she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had exercised it eagerly and restlessly, made it a
pretext for innocent perversities in respect to which philosophic time
was at, last to reduce all groans to gentleness. And they had loved each
other so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) own intelligence, on the higher line, had temporarily
paid for it. The futilities, the enormities, the depravities, of
decoration and ingenuity, that, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) sense was unsealed, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) think lovely! Musing, reconsidering little man that he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) was, and
addicted to silent pleasures--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) was accessible to silent pains--he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>)
even sometimes wondered what would have become of his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) intelligence, in
the sphere in which it was to learn more and more exclusively to play,
if his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) wife's influence upon it had not been, in the strange scheme of
things, so promptly removed. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) have led him (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) altogether, attached
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) was to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), into the wilderness of mere mistakes? Would she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) have
prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) from ever scaling his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) vertiginous Peak?--or would she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
otherwise, have been able to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) to that eminence, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) might have pointed out to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as Cortez to HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Cortez</b></font>) companions, the
revelation vouchsafed? No companion of Cortez had presumably been a real
lady: Mr. Verver allowed that historic fact to determine his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) inference.




<p/>VIII

<p/>What was at all events not permanently hidden from him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was a truth much
less invidious about his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) years of darkness. It was the strange scheme of
things again: the years of darkness had been needed to render possible
the years of light. A wiser hand than he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) at first knew had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) hard
at acquisition of one sort as a perfect preliminary to acquisition of
another, and the preliminary would have been weak and wanting if the
good faith of it had been less. His (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) comparative blindness had made
the good faith, which in its turn had made the soil propitious for the
flower of the supreme idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had had to LIKE forging and sweating, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
had had to like polishing and piling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) arms. They were things at
least he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had had to believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) liked, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) liked
transcendent calculation and imaginative gambling all for themselves,
the creation of <div class="bookquote">``interests''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that were the extinction of other interests,
the livid vulgarity, even, of getting in, or getting out, first. That
had of course been so far from really the case--with the supreme idea,
all the while, growing and striking deep, under everything, in the warm,
rich earth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had stood unknowing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had walked and worked where it
was buried, and the fact itself, the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) fortune, would have
been a barren fact enough if the first sharp tender shoot had never
struggled into day. There on one side was the ugliness his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) middle time
had been spared; there on the other, from all the portents, was the
beauty with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) age might still be crowned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was happier,
doubtless, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) deserved; but THAT, when one was happy at all, it
was easy to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had wrought by devious ways, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had reached the
place, and what would ever have been straighter, in any man's life,
than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, now, of occupying it? It hadn't merely, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plan, all the
sanctions of civilization; it was positively civilization condensed,
concrete, consummate, set down by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands as a house on a rock--a
house from whose open doors and windows, open to grateful, to thirsty
millions, the higher, the highest knowledge would shine out to bless the
land. In this house, designed as a gift, primarily, to the people of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
adoptive city and native State, the urgency of whose release from the
bondage of ugliness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in a position to measure--in this museum of
museums, a palace of art which was to show for compact as a Greek temple
was compact, a receptacle of treasures sifted to positive sanctity, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
spirit to-day almost altogether lived, making up, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have said,
for lost time and haunting the portico in anticipation of the final
rites.

<p/>These would be the <div class="bookquote">``opening exercises,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the august dedication of the
place. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imagination, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was well aware, got over the ground faster
than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) judgment; there was much still to do for the production of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
first effect. Foundations were laid and walls were rising, the structure
of the shell all determined; but raw haste was forbidden him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a
connection so intimate with the highest effects of patience and piety;
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should belie himself by completing without a touch at least of the
majesty of delay a monument to the religion he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished to propagate, the
exemplary passion, the passion for perfection at any price. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was far
from knowing as yet where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would end, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was admirably definite
as to where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't begin. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't begin with a small show--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would begin with a great, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could scarce have indicated, even had
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished to try, the line of division he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had drawn. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken no
trouble to indicate it to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellow-citizens, purveyors and consumers,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own and the circumjacent commonwealths, of comic matter in large
lettering, diurnally <div class="bookquote">``set up,''  (<font color='red'><b>consumers</b></font>)</div>printed, published, folded and delivered,
at the expense of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presumptuous emulation of the snail. The snail
had become for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), under this ironic suggestion, the loveliest beast
in nature, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) return to England, of which we are present witnesses,
had not been unconnected with the appreciation so determined. It marked
what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked to mark, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needed, on the matter in question,
instruction from no one on earth. A couple of years of Europe again, of
renewed nearness to changes and chances, refreshed sensibility to the
currents of the market, would fall in with the consistency of wisdom,
the particular shade of enlightened conviction, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished to
observe. It didn't look like much for a whole family to hang about
waiting-they being now, since the birth of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grandson, a whole
family; and there was henceforth only one ground in all the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
felt, on which the question of appearance would ever really again count
for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cared that a work of art of price should <div class="bookquote">``look like''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>the
master to whom it might perhaps be deceitfully attributed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
ceased on the whole to know any matter of the rest of life by its looks.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took life in general higher up the stream; so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not
actually taking it as a collector, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was taking it, decidedly, as a
grandfather. In the way of precious small pieces he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had handled nothing
so precious as the Principino, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter's first-born, whose Italian
designation endlessly amused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could manipulate
and dandle, already almost toss and catch again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't a
correspondingly rare morsel of an earlier pate tendre. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could take
the small clutching child from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nurse's arms with an iteration grimly
discountenanced, in respect to their contents, by the glass doors of
high cabinets. Something clearly beatific in this new relation had,
moreover, without doubt, confirmed for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the sense that none of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
silent answers to public detraction, to local vulgarity, had ever been
so legitimately straight as the mere element of attitude--reduce it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said, to that--in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) easy weeks at Fawns. The element of attitude was
all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted of these weeks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was enjoying it on the spot, even
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hoped: enjoying it in spite of Mrs. Rance and the Miss
Lutches; in spite of the small worry of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belief that Fanny Assingham
had really something for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was keeping back; in spite of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) full consciousness, overflowing the cup like a wine too generously
poured, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had consented to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter, and thereby to
make, as it were, the difference, what surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now was, exactly,
consent vivified, marriage demonstrated, the difference, in fine,
definitely made. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could call back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prior, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own wedded
consciousness--it was not yet out of range of vague reflection. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
supposed himself, above all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had supposed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, as married as
anyone could be, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered if their state had deserved the
name, or their union worn the beauty, in the degree to which the couple
now before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried the matter. In especial since the birth of their
boy, in New York--the grand climax of their recent American period,
brought to so right an issue--the happy pair struck him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as having
carried it higher, deeper, further; to where it ceased to concern
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) imagination, at any rate, to follow them. Extraordinary, beyond
question, was one branch of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) characteristic mute wonderment--it
characterised above all, with its subject before it, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) modesty: the
strange dim doubt, waking up for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at the end of the years, of whether
Maggie's mother had, after all, been capable of the maximum. The maximum
of tenderness he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) meant--as the terms existed for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); the maximum of
immersion in the fact of being married. Maggie herself was capable;
Maggie herself at this season, was, exquisitely, divinely, the maximum:
such was the impression that, positively holding off a little for the
practical, the tactful consideration it inspired in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), a respect for
the beauty and sanctity of it almost amounting to awe--such was the
impression he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) daily received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother, oh yes--but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother and something more; it becoming thus a new light for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),
and in such a curious way too, that anything more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother should
prove at this time of day possible.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could live over again at almost any quiet moment the long process
of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) introduction to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) present interests--an introduction that
had depended all on himself, like the <div class="bookquote">``cheek''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>of the young man who
approaches a boss without credentials or picks up an acquaintance, makes
even a real friend, by speaking to a passer in the street. HIS (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) real
friend, in all the business, was to have been his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) own mind, with which
nobody had put him (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) in relation. He (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) had knocked at the door of that
essentially private house, and his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) call, in truth, had not been
immediately answered; so that when, after waiting and coming back,
he (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) had at last got in, it was, twirling his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) hat, as an embarrassed
stranger, or, trying his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) keys, as a thief at night. He (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) had gained
confidence only with time, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) had taken real possession of
the place it had been never again to come away. All of which success
represented, it must be allowed, his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) one principle of pride. Pride in
the mere original spring, pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) money, would have been pride in
something that had come, in comparison, so easily. The right ground
for elation was difficulty mastered, and his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) difficulty--thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>)
modesty--had been to believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) facility. THIS was the problem he (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>)
had worked out to its solution--the solution that was now doing more
than all else to make his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) feet settle and his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) days flush; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>)
wished to feel <div class="bookquote">``good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as they said at American City, he (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) had but to
retrace his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) immense development. That was what the whole thing came back
to--that the development had not been somebody's else passing falsely,
accepted too ignobly, for his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>). To think how servile he (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) might have been
was absolutely to respect himself, was in fact, as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) liked, to
admire himself, as free. The very finest spring that ever responded
to his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) touch was always there to press--the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) freedom as
dawning upon him (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>), like a sunrise all pink and silver, during a winter
divided between Florence, Rome and Naples some three years after his (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>)
wife's death. It was the hushed daybreak of the Roman revelation in
particular that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) could usually best recover, with the way that
there, above all, where the princes and Popes had been before him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>)
divination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) faculty most went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) was a plain American
citizen, staying at an hotel where, sometimes, for days together, there
were twenty others like him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>); but no Pope, no prince of them all had read
a richer meaning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) believed, into the character of the Patron of Art.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) was ashamed of them really, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) wasn't afraid, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had on the
whole never so climbed to the tip-top as in judging, over a perusal
of Hermann Grimm, where Julius II and Leo X were <div class="bookquote">``placed''  (<font color='red'><b>Leo</b></font>)</div>by their
treatment of Michael Angelo. Far below the plain American citizen--in
the case at least in which this personage happened not to be too plain
to be Adam Verver. Going to our friend's head, moreover, some of the
results of such comparisons may doubtless be described as having stayed
there. His (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) freedom to see--of which the comparisons were part--what
could it do but steadily grow and grow?

<p/>It came perhaps even too much to stand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) for ALL freedom--since,
for example, it was as much there as ever at the very time of Mrs.
Rance's conspiring against him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), at Fawns, with the billiard-room and the
Sunday morning, on the occasion round which we have perhaps drawn our
circle too wide. Mrs. Rance at least controlled practically each other
license of the present and the near future: the license to pass the hour
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) would have found convenient; the license to stop remembering, for
a little, that, though if proposed to--and not only by this aspirant but
by any other--he (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) wouldn't prove foolish, the proof of wisdom was none
the less, in such a fashion, rather cruelly conditioned; the license
in especial to proceed from his (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) journals and insulate,
orientate, himself afresh by the sound, over his (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) gained interval, of
the many-mouthed monster the exercise of whose lungs he (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) so constantly
stimulated. Mrs. Rance remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) till the others came back from
church, and it was by that time clearer than ever that his (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) ordeal, when
it should arrive, would be really most unpleasant. His (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) impression--this
was the point--took somehow the form not so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) wanting to press
home her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) own advantage as of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) building better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) knew; that
is of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) symbolising, with virtual unconsciousness, his (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) own special
deficiency, his (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) unfortunate lack of a wife to whom applications could
be referred. The applications, the contingencies with which Mrs. Rance
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) as potentially bristling, were not of a sort, really, to be
met by one's self. And the possibility of them, when his (<font color='blue'><b>aspirant</b></font>) visitor said,
or as good as said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm restrained, you see, because of Mr. Rance, and
also because I'm proud and refined; but if it WASN'T for Mr. Rance and
for my refinement and my pride!'' (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>--the possibility of them, I say, turned
to a great murmurous rustle, of a volume to fill the future; a rustle
of petticoats, of scented, many-paged letters, of voices as to which,
distinguish themselves as they might from each other, it mattered
little in what part of the resounding country they had learned to make
themselves prevail. The Assinghams and the Miss Lutches had taken the
walk, through the park, to the little old church, <div class="bookquote">``on the property,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lutches</b></font>)</div>that our friend had often found himself wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) were able to
transport, as it stood, for its simple sweetness, in a glass case, to
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) exhibitory halls; while Maggie had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband,
not inveterate in such practices, to make with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), by carriage, the
somewhat longer pilgrimage to the nearest altar, modest though it
happened to be, of the faith--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own as it had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mother's, and
as Mr. Verver himself had been loosely willing, always, to let it be
taken for his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)--without the solid ease of which, making the stage firm
and smooth, the drama of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) marriage might not have been acted out.

<p/>What at last appeared to have happened, however, was that the divided
parties, coming back at the same moment, had met outside and then
drifted together, from empty room to room, yet not in mere aimless quest
of the pair of companions they had left at home. The quest had carried
them to the door of the billiard-room, and their appearance, as it
opened to admit them, determined for Adam Verver, in the oddest way in
the world, a new and sharp perception. It was really remarkable: this
perception expanded, on the spot, as a flower, one of the strangest,
might, at a breath, have suddenly opened. The breath, for that matter,
was more than anything else, the look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter's eyes--the look
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) SAW her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) take in exactly what had occurred in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) absence:
Mrs. Rance's pursuit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) to this remote locality, the spirit and
the very form, perfectly characteristic, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) acceptance of the
complication--the seal set, in short, unmistakably, on one of Maggie's
anxieties. The anxiety, it was true, would have been, even though not
imparted, separately shared; for Fanny Assingham's face was, by the
same stroke, not at all thickly veiled for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), and a queer light, of
a colour quite to match, fairly glittered in the four fine eyes of the
Miss Lutches. Each of these persons--counting out, that is, the Prince
and the Colonel, who didn't care, and who didn't even see that the
others did--knew something, or had at any rate had her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) idea; the idea,
precisely, that this was what Mrs. Rance, artfully biding her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) time,
WOULD do. The special shade of apprehension on the part of the Miss
Lutches might indeed have suggested the vision of an energy supremely
asserted. It was droll, in truth, if one came to that, the position
of the Miss Lutches: they had themselves brought, they had guilelessly
introduced Mrs. Rance, strong in the fact of Mr. Rance's having been
literally beheld of them; and it was now for them, positively, as if
their handful of flowers--since Mrs. Rance was a handful!--had been but
the vehicle of a dangerous snake. Mr. Verver fairly felt in the air the
Miss Lutches' imputation--in the intensity of which, really, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) own
propriety might have been involved.

<p/>That, none the less, was but a flicker; what made the real difference,
as I have hinted, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) mute passage with Maggie. His (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter's
anxiety alone had depths, and it opened out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) the wider that it
was altogether new. When, in their common past, when till this moment,
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) shown a fear, however dumbly, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) individual life? They
had had fears together, just as they had had joys, but all of hers, at
least, had been for what equally concerned them. Here of a sudden was
a question that concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) alone, and the soundless explosion of it
somehow marked a date. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was even in a manner on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands--as a distinct thing, that is, from being, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had always
been, merely deep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life; too deep down, as it
were, to be disengaged, contrasted or opposed, in short objectively
presented. But time finally had done it; their relation was altered:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) SAW, again, the difference lighted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). This marked it to
himself--and it wasn't a question simply of a Mrs. Rance the more or the
less. For Maggie too, at a stroke, almost beneficently, their visitor
had, from being an inconvenience, become a sign. They had made vacant,
by their marriage, his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) immediate foreground, his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) personal precinct--they
being the Princess and the Prince. They had made room in it for
others--so others had become aware. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) became aware himself, for that
matter, during the minute Maggie stood there before speaking; and with
the sense, moreover, of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had the sense of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw HIM. This last, it may be added, would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) intensest
perception had there not, the next instant, been more for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in Fanny
Assingham. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face couldn't keep it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had seen, on top of
everything, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) quick way, what they both were seeing.




<p/>IX

<p/>So much mute communication was doubtless, all this time, marvellous,
and we may confess to having perhaps read into the scene, prematurely,
a critical character that took longer to develop. Yet the quiet hour of
reunion enjoyed that afternoon by the father and the daughter did really
little else than deal with the elements definitely presented to each
in the vibration produced by the return of the church-goers. Nothing
allusive, nothing at all insistent, passed between them either before or
immediately after luncheon--except indeed so far as their failure soon
again to meet might be itself an accident charged with reference. The
hour or two after luncheon--and on Sundays with especial rigour, for
one of the domestic reasons of which it belonged to Maggie quite
multitudinously to take account--were habitually spent by the Princess
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) little boy, in whose apartment she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) either frequently found her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
father already established or was sooner or later joined by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grandson, at some hour or other, held its place, in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
day, against all interventions, and this without counting his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grandson's
visits to HIM, scarcely less ordered and timed, and the odd bits, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
called them, that they picked up together when they could--communions
snatched, for the most part, on the terrace, in the gardens or the park,
while the Principino, with much pomp and circumstance of perambulator,
parasol, fine lace over-veiling and incorruptible female attendance,
took the air. In the private apartments, which, occupying in the great
house the larger part of a wing of their own, were not much more easily
accessible than if the place had been a royal palace and the small
child an heir-apparent--in the nursery of nurseries the talk, at these
instituted times, was always so prevailingly with or about the master
of the scene that other interests and other topics had fairly learned to
avoid the slighting and inadequate notice there taken of them. They came
in, at the best, but as involved in the little boy's future, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) past,
or his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) comprehensive present, never getting so much as a chance to plead
their own merits or to complain of being neglected. Nothing perhaps, in
truth, had done more than this united participation to confirm in the
elder parties that sense of a life not only uninterrupted but more
deeply associated, more largely combined, of which, on Adam Verver's
behalf, we have made some mention. It was of course an old story and a
familiar idea that a beautiful baby could take its place as a new link
between a wife and a husband, but Maggie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father had, with every
ingenuity, converted the precious creature into a link between a mamma
and a grandpapa. The Principino, for a chance spectator of this process,
might have become, by an untoward stroke, a hapless half-orphan, with
the place of immediate male parent swept bare and open to the next
nearest sympathy.

<p/>They had no occasion thus, the conjoined worshippers, to talk of what
the Prince might be or might do for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) son--the sum of service, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) absence, so completely filled itself out. It was not in the least,
moreover, that there was doubt of him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was conspicuously addicted
to the manipulation of the child, in the frank Italian way, at such
moments as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) judged discreet in respect to other claims: conspicuously,
indeed, that is, for Maggie, who had more occasion, on the whole, to
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband of the extravagance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father than to speak
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father of the extravagance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband. Adam Verver had,
all round, in this connection, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) own serenity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was sure of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) son-in-law's auxiliary admiration--admiration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) meant, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
grand-son; since, to begin with, what else had been at work but the
instinct--or it might fairly have been the tradition--of the latter's
making the child so solidly beautiful as to HAVE to be admired? What
contributed most to harmony in this play of relations, however, was the
way the young man seemed to leave it to be gathered that, tradition
for tradition, the grandpapa's own was not, in any estimate, to go for
nothing. A tradition, or whatever it was, that had flowered prelusively
in the Princess herself--well, Amerigo's very discretions were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way
of taking account of it. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discriminations in respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heir
were, in fine, not more angular than any others to be observed in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);
and Mr. Verver received perhaps from no source so distinct an impression
of being for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) an odd and important phenomenon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) received from
this impunity of appropriation, these unchallenged nursery hours. It
was as if the grandpapa's special show of the character were but another
side for the observer to study, another item for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to note. It came
back, this latter personage knew, to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own previous perception--that
of the Prince's inability, in any matter in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was concerned,
to CONCLUDE. The idiosyncrasy, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), at each stage, had to be
demonstrated--on which, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) admirably accepted it. This last
was, after all, the point; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) really worked, poor young man, for
acceptance, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) worked so constantly for comprehension. And how,
when you came to that, COULD you know that a horse wouldn't shy at
a brass-band, in a country road, because it didn't shy at a
traction-engine? It might have been brought up to traction-engines
without having been brought up to brass-bands. Little by little, thus,
from month to month, the Prince was learning what his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife's father
had been brought up to; and now it could be checked off--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had been
brought, up to the romantic view of principini. Who would have thought
it, and where would it all stop? The only fear somewhat sharp for Mr.
Verver was a certain fear of disappointing him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) for strangeness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) felt
that the evidence he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) offered, thus viewed, was too much on the positive
side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) didn't know--he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was learning, and it was funny for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)--to
how many things he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) HAD been brought up. If the Prince could only strike
something to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hadn't! This wouldn't, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), ruffle
the smoothness, and yet MIGHT, a little, add to the interest.

<p/>What was now clear, at all events, for the father and the daughter, was
their simply knowing they wanted, for the time, to be together--at any
cost, as it were; and their necessity so worked in them as to bear them
out of the house, in a quarter hidden from that in which their friends
were gathered, and cause them to wander, unseen, unfollowed, along
a covered walk in the <div class="bookquote">``old''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>garden, as it was called, old with an
antiquity of formal things, high box and shaped yew and expanses of
brick wall that had turned at once to purple and to pink. They went out
of a door in the wall, a door that had a slab with a date set above it,
1713, but in the old multiplied lettering, and then had before them
a small white gate, intensely white and clean amid all the greenness,
through which they gradually passed to where some of the grandest trees
spaciously clustered and where they would find one of the quietest
places. A bench had been placed, long ago, beneath a great oak that
helped to crown a mild eminence, and the ground sank away below it, to
rise again, opposite, at a distance sufficient to enclose the solitude
and figure a bosky horizon. Summer, blissfully, was with them yet, and
the low sun made a splash of light where it pierced the looser shade;
Maggie, coming down to go out, had brought a parasol, which, as, over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) charming bare head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now handled it, gave, with the big straw
hat that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father in these days always wore a good deal tipped
back, definite intention to their walk. They knew the bench; it was
<div class="bookquote">``sequestered'' (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>--they had praised it for that together, before, and liked
the word; and after they had begun to linger there they could have
smiled -LRB-if they hadn't been really too serious, and if the question
hadn't so soon ceased to matter-RRB-, over the probable wonder of the others
as to what would have become of them.

<p/>The extent to which they enjoyed their indifference to any judgment of
their want of ceremony, what did that of itself speak but for the way
that, as a rule, they almost equally had others on their mind? They each
knew that both were full of the superstition of not <div class="bookquote">``hurting,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but might
precisely have been asking themselves, asking in fact each other, at
this moment, whether that was to be, after all, the last word of their
conscientious development. Certain it was, at all events, that,
in addition to the Assinghams and the Lutches and Mrs. Rance, the
attendance at tea, just in the right place on the west terrace, might
perfectly comprise the four or five persons--among them the very
pretty, the typically Irish Miss Maddock, vaunted, announced and now
brought--from the couple of other houses near enough, one of these the
minor residence Of their proprietor, established, thriftily, while he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>)
hired out his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) ancestral home, within sight and sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) profit.
It was not less certain, either, that, for once in a way, the group in
question must all take the case as they found it. Fanny Assingham, at
any time, for that matter, might perfectly be trusted to see Mr. Verver
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter, to see their reputation for a decent friendliness,
through any momentary danger; might be trusted even to carry off their
absence for Amerigo, for Amerigo's possible funny Italian anxiety;
Amerigo always being, as the Princess was well aware, conveniently
amenable to this friend's explanations, beguilements, reassurances,
and perhaps in fact rather more than less dependent on them as his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) new
life--since that was his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own name for it--opened out. It was no secret
to Maggie--it was indeed positively a public joke for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
couldn't explain as Mrs. Assingham did, and that, the Prince liking
explanations, liking them almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) collected them, in the manner
of book-plates or postage-stamps, for themselves, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) requisition
of this luxury had to be met. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) didn't seem to want them as yet for
use--rather for ornament and amusement, innocent amusement of the
kind he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) most fancied and that was so characteristic of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) blessed,
beautiful, general, slightly indolent lack of more dissipated, or even
just of more sophisticated, tastes.

<p/>However that might be, the dear woman had come to be frankly and gaily
recognised--and not least by herself--as filling in the intimate little
circle an office that was not always a sinecure. It was almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had taken, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kind, melancholy Colonel at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heels, a responsible
engagement; to be within call, as it were, for all those appeals that
sprang out of talk, that sprang not a little, doubtless too, out of
leisure. It naturally led her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position in the household, as, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) called
it, to considerable frequency of presence, to visits, from the good
couple, freely repeated and prolonged, and not so much as under form
of protest. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was there to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) quiet--it was Amerigo's own
description of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) influence; and it would only have needed a more
visible disposition to unrest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to make the account perfectly fit.
Fanny herself limited indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) minimised, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) office; you didn't
need a jailor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) contended, for a domesticated lamb tied up with pink
ribbon. This was not an animal to be controlled--it was an animal to
be, at the most, educated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) admitted accordingly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
educative--which Maggie was so aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) herself, inevitably,
wasn't; so it came round to being true that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was most in charge
of was his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) mere intelligence. This left, goodness knew, plenty of
different calls for Maggie to meet--in a case in which so much pink
ribbon, as it might be symbolically named, was lavished on the creature.
What it all amounted to, at any rate, was that Mrs. Assingham would be
keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) quiet now, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) father-in-law carried out
their own little frugal picnic; quite moreover, doubtless, not much less
neededly in respect to the members of the circle that were with them
there than in respect to the pair they were missing almost for the first
time. It was present to Maggie that the Prince could bear, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife, almost any queerness on the part of people, strange
English types, who bored him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), beyond convenience, by being so little
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) himself was; for this was one of the ways in which a wife was
practically sustaining. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was as positively aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hadn't
yet learned to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) as meeting such exposure in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) absence. How did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) move and talk, how above all did he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), or how WOULD he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), look--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) who,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) so nobly handsome face, could look such wonderful things--in
case of being left alone with some of the subjects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wonder?
There were subjects for wonder among these very neighbours; only Maggie
herself had her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own odd way--which didn't moreover the least irritate
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--of really liking them in proportion as they could strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
as strange. It came out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by heredity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) amused himself with
declaring, this love of chinoiseries; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) actually this evening
didn't mind--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might deal with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) Chinese as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could.

<p/>Maggie indeed would always have had for such moments, had they oftener
occurred, the impression made on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by a word of Mrs. Assingham's, a
word referring precisely to that appetite in Amerigo for the explanatory
which we have just found in our path. It wasn't that the Princess could
be indebted to another person, even to so clever a one as this friend,
for seeing anything in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) mightn't see unaided; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had ever, hitherto, been of a nature to accept with modest gratitude
any better description of a felt truth than her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) little limits--terribly
marked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) knew, in the direction of saying the right things--enabled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) to make. Thus it was, at any rate, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was able to live more
or less in the light of the fact expressed so lucidly by their common
comforter--the fact that the Prince was saving up, for some very
mysterious but very fine eventual purpose, all the wisdom, all the
answers to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) questions, all the impressions and generalisations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
gathered; putting them away and packing them down because he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
great gun to be loaded to the brim on the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) should decide to let it
off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wanted first to make sure of the whole of the subject that was
unrolling itself before him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); after which the innumerable facts he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
collected would find their use. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was about--trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
at last therefore to make, and to some effect, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) big noise. And Mrs.
Assingham had repeated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was about. It was the happy
form of this assurance that had remained with Maggie; it could always
come in for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that Amerigo knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might at moments
seem vague, seem absent, seem even bored: this when, away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father, with whom it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to appear anything but
respectfully occupied, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) native gaiety go in outbreaks of
song, or even of quite whimsical senseless sound, either expressive of
intimate relaxation or else fantastically plaintive. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might at times
reflect with the frankest lucidity on the circumstance that the case was
for a good while yet absolutely settled in regard to what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) still
had left, at home, of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) very own; in regard to the main seat of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
affection, the house in Rome, the big black palace, the Palazzo Nero, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) was fond of naming it, and also on the question of the villa in the
Sabine hills, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sabine</b></font>) had, at the time of their engagement, seen and
yearned over, and the Castello proper, described by him (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) always as
the <div class="bookquote">``perched''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>place, that had, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sabine</b></font>) knew, formerly stood up, on the
pedestal of its mountain-slope, showing beautifully blue from afar, as
the head and front of the princedom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) might rejoice in certain moods
over the so long-estranged state of these properties, not indeed
all irreclaimably alienated, but encumbered with unending leases and
charges, with obstinate occupants, with impossibilities of use--all
without counting the cloud of mortgages that had, from far back, buried
them beneath the ashes of rage and remorse, a shroud as thick as the
layer once resting on the towns at the foot of Vesuvius, and actually
making of any present restorative effort a process much akin to slow
excavation. Just so he (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) might with another turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) humour almost wail
for these brightest spots of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) lost paradise, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) was an
idiot not to be able to bring himself to face the sacrifices--sacrifices
resting, if definitely anywhere, with Mr. Verver--necessary for winning
them back.

<p/>One of the most comfortable things between the husband and the wife
meanwhile--one of those easy certitudes they could be merely gay
about--was that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never admired him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) so much, or so found him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
heartbreakingly handsome, clever, irresistible, in the very degree in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had originally and fatally dawned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw
other women reduced to the same passive pulp that had then begun, once
for all, to constitute HER substance. There was really nothing they had
talked of together with more intimate and familiar pleasantry than of
the license and privilege, the boundless happy margin, thus established
for each: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) going so far as to put it that, even should he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) some day
get drunk and beat her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), the spectacle of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with hated rivals would,
after no matter what extremity, always, for the sovereign charm of it,
charm of it in itself and as the exhibition of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that most deeply
moved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), suffice to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) round. What would therefore be more open
to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) than to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) agreed, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart,
at these light moments, that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) course wouldn't then be difficult,
inasmuch as, so simply constituted as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was on all the precious
question--and why should he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) be ashamed of it?--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew but one way with
the fair. They had to be fair--and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was fastidious and particular, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
standard was high; but when once this was the case what relation with
them was conceivable, what relation was decent, rudimentary, properly
human, but that of a plain interest in the fairness? His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) interest, she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
always answered, happened not to be <div class="bookquote">``plain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and plainness, all round,
had little to do with the matter, which was marked, on the contrary, by
the richest variety of colour; but the working basis, at all events, had
been settled--the Miss Maddocks of life been assured of their importance
for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). How conveniently assured Maggie--to take him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) too into the
joke--had more than once gone so far as to mention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father; since
it fell in easily with the tenderness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) disposition to remember she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
might occasionally make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) happy by an intimate confidence. This
was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rules-full as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was of little rules, considerations,
provisions. There were things she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) of course couldn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), in so
many words, about Amerigo and herself, and about their happiness and
their union and their deepest depths--and there were other things she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
needn't; but there were also those that were both true and amusing,
both communicable and real, and of these, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) so conscious, so
delicately cultivated scheme of conduct as a daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) profit at will. A pleasant hush, for that matter, had fallen on
most of the elements while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lingered apart with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion; it
involved, this serenity, innumerable complete assumptions: since so
ordered and so splendid a rest, all the tokens, spreading about them, of
confidence solidly supported, might have suggested for persons of poorer
pitch the very insolence of facility. Still, they weren't insolent--THEY
weren't, our pair could reflect; they were only blissful and grateful
and personally modest, not ashamed of knowing, with competence, when
great things were great, when good things were good, and when safe
things were safe, and not, therefore, placed below their fortune by
timidity which would have been as bad as being below it by impudence.
Worthy of it as they were, and as each appears, under our last possible
analysis, to have wished to make the other feel that they were, what
they most finally exhaled into the evening air as their eyes mildly
met may well have been a kind of helplessness in their felicity. Their
rightness, the justification of everything--something they so felt
the pulse of--sat there with them; but they might have been asking
themselves a little blankly to what further use they could put anything
so perfect. They had created and nursed and established it; they had
housed it here in dignity and crowned it with comfort; but mightn't the
moment possibly count for them--or count at least for us while we watch
them with their fate all before them--as the dawn of the discovery that
it doesn't always meet ALL contingencies to be right? Otherwise why
should Maggie have found a word of definite doubt--the expression of the
fine pang determined in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a few hours before--rise after a time to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
lips? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took so for granted moreover her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion's intelligence
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doubt that the mere vagueness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) question could say it all.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it, after all, that they want to do to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>were for
the Princess too the hovering forces of which Mrs. Rance was the symbol,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) father, only smiling back now, at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ease, took no trouble to
appear not to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) meant. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) meant--when once she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) had
spoken--could come out well enough; though indeed it was nothing, after
they had come to the point, that could serve as ground for a great
defensive campaign. The waters of talk spread a little, and Maggie
presently contributed an idea in saying: <div class="bookquote">``What has really happened is
that the proportions, for us, are altered.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) accepted equally, for
the time, this somewhat cryptic remark; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) still failed to challenge her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added that it wouldn't so much matter if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hadn't been
so terribly young. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uttered a sound of protest only when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went to
declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ought as a daughter, in common decency, to have waited.
Yet by that time she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was already herself admitting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should have
had to wait long--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) waited, that is, till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was old. But there was
a way. <div class="bookquote">``Since you ARE an irresistible youth, we've got to face it. That,
somehow, is what that woman has made me feel. There'll be others.''



 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>X

<p/>To talk of it thus appeared at last a positive relief to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
there'll be others. But you'll see me through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean if you give in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no. Through my holding out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie waited again, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke it had an effect of abruptness.
<div class="bookquote">``Why SHOULD you hold out forever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave, none the less, no start--and this as from the habit of taking
anything, taking everything, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as harmonious. But it was quite
written upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too, for that matter, that holding out wouldn't be,
so very completely, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) natural, or at any rate his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) acquired, form.
His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) appearance would have testified that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might have to do so a long
time--for a man so greatly beset. This appearance, that is, spoke but
little, as yet, of short remainders and simplified senses--and all in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being a small, spare, slightly stale person, deprived of
the general prerogative of presence. It was not by mass or weight or
vulgar immediate quantity that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would in the future, any more than
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done in the past, insist or resist or prevail. There was even
something in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position, on any occasion, made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
relation to any scene or to any group, a matter of the back of the
stage, of an almost visibly conscious want of affinity with the
footlights. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have figured less than anything the stage-manager
or the author of the play, who most occupy the foreground; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be,
at the best, the financial <div class="bookquote">``backer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>watching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interests from the
wing, but in rather confessed ignorance of the mysteries of mimicry.
Barely taller than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pressed at no point on the presumed
propriety of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) greater stoutness. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost early in life much of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crisp, closely-curling hair, the fineness of which was repeated in a
small neat beard, too compact to be called <div class="bookquote">``full,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>though worn equally,
as for a mark where other marks were wanting, on lip and cheek and
chin. His (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) neat, colourless face, provided with the merely indispensable
features, suggested immediately, for a description, that it was CLEAR,
and in this manner somewhat resembled a small decent room, clean-swept
and unencumbered with furniture, but drawing a particular advantage,
as might presently be noted, from the outlook of a pair of ample and
uncurtained windows. There was something in Adam Verver's eyes that both
admitted the morning and the evening in unusual quantities and gave the
modest area the outward extension of a view that was <div class="bookquote">``big''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>even when
restricted to stars. Deeply and changeably blue, though not romantically
large, they were yet youthfully, almost strangely beautiful, with their
ambiguity of your scarce knowing if they most carried their possessor's
vision out or most opened themselves to your own. Whatever you might
feel, they stamped the place with their importance, as the house-agents
say; so that, on one side or the other, you were never out of their
range, were moving about, for possible community, opportunity, the sight
of you scarce knew what, either before them or behind them. If other
importances, not to extend the question, kept themselves down, they
were in no direction less obtruded than in that of our friend's dress,
adopted once for all as with a sort of sumptuary scruple. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wore every
day of the year, whatever the occasion, the same little black <div class="bookquote">``cut away''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>coat, of the fashion of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) younger time; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wore the same cool-looking
trousers, chequered in black and white--the proper harmony with which,
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) inveterately considered, was a sprigged blue satin necktie; and,
over his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) concave little stomach, quaintly indifferent to climates and
seasons, a white duck waistcoat. <div class="bookquote">``Should you really,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) now asked,
<div class="bookquote">``like me to marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke as if, coming from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) daughter herself, it
MIGHT be an idea; which, for that matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would be ready to carry out
should she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) definitely say so.

<p/>Definite, however, just yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was not prepared to be, though it
seemed to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) with force, as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) thought, that there was a
truth, in the connection, to utter. <div class="bookquote">``What I feel is that there is
somehow something that used to be right and that I've made wrong. It
used to be right that you hadn't married, and that you didn't seem to
want to. It used also'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) continued to make out <div class="bookquote">``to seem easy for the
question not to come up. That's what I've made different. It does come
up. It WILL come up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't think I can keep it down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Verver's tone was cheerfully
pensive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've given you, by MY move, all the trouble of having to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) liked the tenderness of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) idea, and it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sat near
him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) arm about her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I guess I don't feel as if you had `moved'
very far. You've only moved next door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I don't feel as if it were fair for me just to
have given you a push and left you so. If I've made the difference for
you, I must think of the difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) indulgently asked, <div class="bookquote">``DO you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what I don't yet know. But I must find out. We must think
together--as we've always thought. What I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) went on after a
moment, <div class="bookquote">``is that it strikes me that I ought to at least offer you some
alternative. I ought to have worked one out for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An alternative to what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to your simply missing what you've lost--without anything being
done about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what HAVE I lost?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) thought a minute, as if it were difficult to say, yet as if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
more and more saw it. <div class="bookquote">``Well, whatever it was that, BEFORE, kept us from
thinking, and kept you, really, as you might say, in the market. It
was as if you couldn't be in the market when you were married to me. Or
rather as if I kept people off, innocently, by being married to you. Now
that I'm married to some one else you're, as in consequence, married to
nobody. Therefore you may be married to anybody, to everybody. People
don't see why you shouldn't be married to THEM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it enough of a reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) mildly inquired, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't want to
be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's enough of a reason, yes. But to BE enough of a reason it has to be
too much of a trouble. I mean FOR you. It has to be too much of a fight.
You ask me what you've lost,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie continued to explain. <div class="bookquote">``The not
having to take the trouble and to make the fight--that's what you've
lost. The advantage, the happiness of being just as you were--because I
was just as _I_ was--that's what you miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father presently said, <div class="bookquote">``that I had better get
married just in order to be as I was before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>The detached tone of it--detached as if innocently to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by
showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) desire to accommodate--was so far successful as to draw from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gravity a short, light laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Well, what I don't want you to feel
is that if you were to I shouldn't understand. I SHOULD understand.
That's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess gently.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) companion turned it pleasantly over. <div class="bookquote">``You don't go so far as to wish
me to take somebody I don't like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) sighed, <div class="bookquote">``you know how far I go--how far I COULD go.
But I only wish that if you ever SHOULD like anybody, you may never
doubt of my feeling how I've brought you to it. You'll always know that
I know that it's my fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) went on in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) contemplative way, <div class="bookquote">``that it will be you
who'll take the consequences?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie just considered. <div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you all the good ones, but I'll take
the bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's handsome.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) emphasised his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sense of it by drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
closer and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) more tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``It's about all I could expect of
you. So far as you've wronged me, therefore, we'll call it square. I'll
let you know in time if I see a prospect of your having to take it up.
But am I to understand meanwhile,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) soon went on, <div class="bookquote">``that, ready as you
are to see me through my collapse, you're not ready, or not AS ready,
to see me through my resistance? I've got to be a regular martyr before
you'll be inspired?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) demurred at his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) way of putting it. <div class="bookquote">``Why, if you like it, you know,
it won't BE a collapse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why talk about seeing me through at all? I shall only collapse if
I do like it. But what I seem to feel is that I don't WANT to like
it. That is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) amended, <div class="bookquote">``unless I feel surer I do than appears very
probable. I don't want to have to THINK I like it in a case when I
really shan't. I've had to do that in some cases,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) confessed--<div class="bookquote">``when
it has been a question of other things. I don't want,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``to
be MADE to make a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but it's too dreadful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``that you should even have to
FEAR--or just nervously to dream--that you may be. What does that show,
after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``but that you do really, well within, feel a
want? What does it show but that you're truly susceptible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it may show that'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) defended himself against nothing. <div class="bookquote">``But it
shows also, I think, that charming women are, in the kind of life we're
leading now, numerous and formidable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie entertained for a moment the proposition; under cover of which,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) passed quickly from the general to the particular. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
feel Mrs. Rance to be charming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) to be formidable. When they cast a spell it comes to
the same thing. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>)'d do anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well, I'd help you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess said with decision, <div class="bookquote">``as against
HER--if that's all you require. It's too funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) went on before he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
again spoke, <div class="bookquote">``that Mrs. Rance should be here at all. But if you talk
of the life we lead, much of it is, altogether, I'm bound to say, too
funny. The thing is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Maggie developed under this impression, <div class="bookquote">``that I
don't think we lead, as regards other people, any life at all. We don't
at any rate, it seems to me, lead half the life we might. And so
it seems, I think, to Amerigo. So it seems also, I'm sure, to Fanny
Assingham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver-as if from due regard for these persons--considered a little.
<div class="bookquote">``What life would they like us to lead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's not a question, I think, on which they quite feel together.
SHE thinks, dear Fanny, that we ought to be greater.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Greater--?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) echoed it vaguely. <div class="bookquote">``And Amerigo too, you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah yes'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reply was prompt <div class="bookquote">``but Amerigo doesn't mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) doesn't
care, I mean, what we do. It's for us, he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) considers, to see things
exactly as we wish. Fanny herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie pursued, <div class="bookquote">``thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'s
magnificent. Magnificent, I mean, for taking everything as it is, for
accepting the `social limitations' of our life, for not missing what we
don't give him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver attended. <div class="bookquote">``Then if he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) doesn't miss it his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) magnificence is
easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It IS easy-that's exactly what I think. If there were things he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) DID
miss, and if in spite of them he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) were always sweet, then, no doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)
would be a more or less unappreciated hero. He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) COULD be a Hero--he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) WILL
be one if it's ever necessary. But it will be about something better
than our dreariness. _I_ know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess declared, <div class="bookquote">``where he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'s
magnificent.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) rested a minute on that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) ended, however, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had begun. <div class="bookquote">``We're not, all the same, committed to anything stupid.
If we ought to be grander, as Fanny thinks, we CAN be grander. There's
nothing to prevent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a strict moral obligation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>Adam Verver inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--it's for the amusement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For whose? For Fanny's own?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For everyone's--though I dare say Fanny's would be a large part.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
hesitated; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had now, it might have appeared, something more to bring
out, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) finally produced. <div class="bookquote">``For yours in particular, say--if
you go into the question.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) even bravely followed it up. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't
really, after all, had to think much to see that much more can be done
for you than is done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver uttered an odd vague sound. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think a good deal is
done when you come out and talk to me this way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter, smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we make too much of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And
then to explain: <div class="bookquote">``That's good, and it's natural--but it isn't great. We
forget that we're as free as air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, THAT'S great,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Verver pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``Great if we act on it. Not if
we don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) continued to smile, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) smile; wondering again a little
by this time, however; struck more and more by an intensity in it that
belied a light tone. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) demanded, <div class="bookquote">``to do to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) added, as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) didn't say: <div class="bookquote">``You've got something in your mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It had
come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) within the minute that from the beginning of their session
there she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been keeping something back, and that an impression of
this had more than once, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) general theoretic respect for
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) present right to personal reserves and mysteries, almost ceased to
be vague in him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>). There had been from the first something in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) anxious
eyes, in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) occasionally lost herself, that it would perfectly
explain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was therefore now quite sure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got something up your sleeve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had a silence that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) right. <div class="bookquote">``Well, when I tell you you'll
understand. It's only up my sleeve in the sense of being in a letter I
got this morning. All day, yes--it HAS been in my mind. I've been asking
myself if it were quite the right moment, or in any way fair, to ask you
if you could stand just now another woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) a little, yet the beautiful consideration of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) manner
made it in a degree portentous. <div class="bookquote">``Stand one--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) stared--then he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``It depends on who she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There--you see! I've at all events been thinking whether you'd take
this particular person but as a worry the more. Whether, that is, you'd
go so far with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in your notion of having to be kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) gave at this the quickest shake to his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) foot. How far would she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) go in
HER notion of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter returned, <div class="bookquote">``you know how far, in a general way,
Charlotte Stant goes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte? Is SHE coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) writes me, practically, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'d like to if we're so good as to
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver continued to gaze, but rather as if waiting for more. Then,
as everything appeared to have come, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) expression had a drop. If this
was all it was simple. <div class="bookquote">``Then why in the world not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's face lighted anew, but it was now another light. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't a
want of tact?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To propose it to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That _I_ should ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) put the question as an effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) remnant of vagueness, but this
had also its own effect. Maggie wondered an instant; after which, as
with a flush of recognition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took it up. <div class="bookquote">``It would be too beautiful
if you WOULD!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This, clearly, had not been her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) first idea--the chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) words had
prompted it. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--it would be kind. It would be quite beautiful of you. That is, of
course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``if you sincerely CAN.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) appeared to wonder an instant why he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) sincerely shouldn't, and indeed,
for that matter, where the question of sincerity came in. This virtue,
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter's friend, had surely been taken for
granted. <div class="bookquote">``My dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I'm afraid of
Charlotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's just what it's lovely to have from you. From the moment
you're NOT--the least little bit--I'll immediately invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But where in the world is she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) spoke as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had not thought of
Charlotte, nor so much as heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) name pronounced, for a very long
time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) quite in fact amicably, almost amusedly, woke up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s in Brittany, at a little bathing-place, with some people I don't
know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s always with people, poor dear--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) rather has to be; even
when, as is sometimes the case; they're people she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) doesn't immensely
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) likes US,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>said Adam Verver. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--fortunately she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
likes us. And if I wasn't afraid of spoiling it for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie added,
<div class="bookquote">``I'd even mention that you're not the one of our number she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) likes
least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should that spoil it for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, you know. What else have we been talking about? It costs
you so much to be liked. That's why I hesitated to tell you of my
letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) stared a moment--as if the subject had suddenly grown out of
recognition. <div class="bookquote">``But Charlotte--on other visits--never used to cost me
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No--only her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) `keep,''' Maggie smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't think I mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) keep--if that's all.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Princess</b></font>)</div>The Princess,
however, it was clear, wished to be thoroughly conscientious. <div class="bookquote">``Well, it
may not be quite all. If I think of its being pleasant to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), it's
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) WILL make a difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what's the harm in that if it's but a difference for the better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then--there you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>And the Princess showed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) smile her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) small
triumphant wisdom. <div class="bookquote">``If you acknowledge a possible difference for the
better we're not, after all, so tremendously right as we are. I mean
we're not--as satisfied and amused. We do see there are ways of being
grander.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But will Charlotte Stant,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father asked with surprise, <div class="bookquote">``make us
grander?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, on this, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) well, had a remarkable reply. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I
think. Really grander.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought; for if this was a sudden opening he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wished but the more to
meet it. <div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)'s so handsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, father.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>And the Princess was almost solemn. <div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)'s so
great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great in nature, in character, in spirit. Great in life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Verver echoed. <div class="bookquote">``What has she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) done--in life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) has been brave and bright,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``That mayn't sound
like much, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) has been so in the face of things that might well
have made it too difficult for many other girls. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) hasn't a
creature in the world really--that is nearly--belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>). Only
acquaintances who, in all sorts of ways, make use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>), and distant
relations who are so afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)'ll make use of THEM that they seldom let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) look at them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver was struck--and, as usual, to some purpose. <div class="bookquote">``If we get her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)
here to improve us don't we too then make use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>It pulled the Princess up, however, but an instant. <div class="bookquote">``We're old,
old friends--we do her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) good too. I should always, even at the
worst--speaking for myself--admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) still more than I used her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. That always does good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Certainly--she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) knows it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) knows, I mean, how
great I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) courage and her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) cleverness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)'s not afraid--not of
anything; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) no more ever takes a liberty with you than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)
trembled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) life. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)'s INTERESTING--which plenty of
other people with plenty of other merits never are a bit.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>In which fine
flicker of vision the truth widened to the Princess's view. <div class="bookquote">``I myself of
course don't take liberties, but then I do, always, by nature, tremble
for my life. That's the way I live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I say, love!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father vaguely murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I live in terror,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) insisted. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a small creeping thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll not persuade me that you're not as good as Charlotte Stant,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
still placidly enough remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may be as good, but I'm not so great--and that's what we're talking
about. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) has a great imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) has, in every way, a great
attitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) has above all a great conscience.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>More perhaps than ever
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) life before Maggie addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father at this moment with a
shade of the absolute in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never come so near telling
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should take it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to believe. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) has only twopence
in the world--but that has nothing to do with it. Or rather indeed'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
quickly corrected herself--<div class="bookquote">``it has everything. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) doesn't care. I
never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) do anything but laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) poverty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) life has been
harder than anyone knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was moreover as if, thus unprecedentedly positive, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child had an
effect upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that Mr. Verver really felt as a new thing. <div class="bookquote">``Why then
haven't you told me about her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, haven't we always known--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) submitted, <div class="bookquote">``that we had already pretty well
sized her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly--we long ago quite took her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) for granted. But things change,
with time, and I seem to know that, after this interval, I'm going to
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) better than ever. I've lived more myself, I'm older, and
one judges better. Yes, I'm going to see in Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the
Princess--and speaking now as with high and free expectation--<div class="bookquote">``more than
I've ever seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll try to do so too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) WAS'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>--it came back to Mr. Verver
more--<div class="bookquote">``the one of your friends I thought the best for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) companion, however, was so launched in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) permitted liberty of
appreciation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) for the moment scarce heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was lost
in the case she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) made out, the vision of the different ways in which
Charlotte had distinguished herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would have liked for instance--I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would have liked
extremely--to marry; and nothing in general is more ridiculous, even
when it has been pathetic, than a woman who has tried and has not been
able.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>It had all Mr. Verver's attention. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has `tried'--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has seen cases where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have liked to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has not been able?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there are more cases, in Europe, in which it doesn't come to
girls who are poor than in which it does come to them. Especially,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said
Maggie with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) continued competence, <div class="bookquote">``when they're Americans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father now met her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and met her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheerfully, on all sides.
<div class="bookquote">``Unless you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suggested, <div class="bookquote">``that when the girls are American there
are more cases in which it comes to the rich than to the poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) good-humouredly. <div class="bookquote">``That may be--but I'm not going to be
smothered in MY case. It ought to make me--if I were in danger of being
a fool--all the nicer to people like Charlotte. It's not hard for ME,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) practically explained, <div class="bookquote">``not to be ridiculous--unless in a very
different way. I might easily be ridiculous, I suppose, by behaving as
if I thought I had done a great thing. Charlotte, at any rate, has done
nothing, and anyone can see it, and see also that it's rather strange;
and yet no one--no one not awfully presumptuous or offensive would
like, or would dare, to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is, as anything but quite
RIGHT. That's what it is to have something about you that carries things
off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver's silence, on this, could only be a sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had caused
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) story to interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>); though the sign when he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) spoke was perhaps
even sharper. <div class="bookquote">``And is it also what you mean by Charlotte's being
`great'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``it's one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ways.

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Again for a little her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father considered. <div class="bookquote">``And who is it she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has tried
to marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side as well, waited as if to bring it out with effect;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) after a minute either renounced or encountered an obstacle. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
afraid I'm not sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then how do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't KNOW'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and, qualifying again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was earnestly emphatic.
<div class="bookquote">``I only make it out for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must make it out about someone in particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had another pause. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I want even for myself to put
names and times, to pull away any veil. I've an idea there has been,
more than once, somebody I'm not acquainted with--and needn't be or
want to be. In any case it's all over, and, beyond giving her (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) credit for
everything, it's none of my business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver deferred, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) discriminated. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see how you can give
credit without knowing the facts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't I give it--generally--for dignity? Dignity, I mean, in
misfortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got to postulate the misfortune first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``I can do that. Isn't it always a misfortune to
be--when you're so fine--so wasted? And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``not to wail
about it, not to look even as if you knew it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver seemed at first to face this as a large question, and then,
after a little, solicited by another view, to let the appeal drop.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mustn't be wasted. We won't at least have waste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>It produced in Maggie's face another gratitude. <div class="bookquote">``Then, dear sir, that's
all I want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>And it would apparently have settled their question and ended their talk
if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father had not, after a little, shown the disposition to revert.
<div class="bookquote">``How many times are you supposing that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has tried?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more, at this, and as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hadn't been, couldn't be, hated to be,
in such delicate matters, literal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was moved to attenuate. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I
don't say she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) absolutely ever TRIED--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked perplexed. <div class="bookquote">``But if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has so absolutely failed, what then had
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has suffered--she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has done that.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>And the Princess added: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has
loved--and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver, however, still wondered. <div class="bookquote">``But how many times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie hesitated, but it cleared up. <div class="bookquote">``Once is enough. Enough, that is,
for one to be kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father listened, yet not challenging--only as with a need of some
basis on which, under these new lights, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bounty could be firm. <div class="bookquote">``But
has she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) told you nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, thank goodness, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stared. <div class="bookquote">``Then don't young women tell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, you mean, it's just what they're supposed to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), flushed again now; with which, after another hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``Do
young men tell?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave a short laugh. <div class="bookquote">``How do I know, my dear, what young men do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then how do _I_ know, father, what vulgar girls do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see--I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quickly returned.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke the next moment as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might, odiously, have been
sharp. <div class="bookquote">``What happens at least is that where there's a great deal of
pride there's a great deal of silence. I don't know, I admit, what _I_
should do if I were lonely and sore--for what sorrow, to speak of, have
I ever had in my life? I don't know even if I'm proud--it seems to me
the question has never come up for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I guess you're proud, Mag,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father cheerfully interposed. <div class="bookquote">``I
mean I guess you're proud enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, I hope I'm humble enough too. I might, at all events, for
all I know, be abject under a blow. How can I tell? Do you realise,
father, that I've never had the least blow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a long, quiet look. <div class="bookquote">``Who SHOULD realise if I don't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you'll realise when I HAVE one!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) exclaimed with a short laugh
that resembled, as for good reasons, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own of a minute before. <div class="bookquote">``I
wouldn't in any case have let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tell me what would have been dreadful
to me. For such wounds and shames are dreadful: at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added,
catching herself up, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose they are; for what, as I say, do I know
of them? I don't WANT to know!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke quite with vehemence. <div class="bookquote">``There
are things that are sacred whether they're joys or pains. But one
can always, for safety, be kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept on; <div class="bookquote">``one feels when that's
right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had got up with these last words; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood there before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with
that particular suggestion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aspect to which even the long habit
of their life together had not closed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sense, kept sharp, year after
year, by the collation of types and signs, the comparison of fine object
with fine object, of one degree of finish, of one form of the exquisite
with another--the appearance of some slight, slim draped <div class="bookquote">``antique''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>of Vatican or Capitoline halls, late and refined, rare as a note and
immortal as a link, set in motion by the miraculous infusion of a modern
impulse and yet, for all the sudden freedom of folds and footsteps
forsaken after centuries by their pedestal, keeping still the quality,
the perfect felicity, of the statue; the blurred, absent eyes, the
smoothed, elegant, nameless head, the impersonal flit of a creature lost
in an alien age and passing as an image in worn relief round and round a
precious vase. She (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) had always had odd moments of striking him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>),
daughter of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) very own though she (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) was, as a figure thus simplified,
<div class="bookquote">``generalised''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in its grace, a figure with which his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) human connection was
fairly interrupted by some vague analogy of turn and attitude, something
shyly mythological and nymphlike. The trick, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was not uncomplacently
aware, was mainly of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) own mind; it came from his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) caring for precious
vases only less than for precious daughters. And what was more to the
point still, it often operated while he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was quite at the same time
conscious that Maggie had been described, even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) prettiness, as
<div class="bookquote">``prim'' (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>--Mrs. Rance herself had enthusiastically used the word of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>); while he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) remembered that when once she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) had been told before him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>),
familiarly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) resembled a nun, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) had replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) was
delighted to hear it and would certainly try to; while also, finally,
it was present to him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) that, discreetly heedless, thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) long
association with nobleness in art, to the leaps and bounds of fashion,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) hair down very straight and flat over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) temples, in
the constant manner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) mother, who had not been a bit mythological.
Nymphs and nuns were certainly separate types, but Mr. Verver, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
really amused himself, let consistency go. The play of vision was at all
events so rooted in him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) could receive impressions of sense even
while positively thinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was positively thinking while Maggie stood
there, and it led for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) to yet another question--which in its turn
led to others still. <div class="bookquote">``Do you regard the condition as hers then that you
spoke of a minute ago?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The condition--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why that of having loved so intensely that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s, as you say, `beyond
everything'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie had scarcely to reflect--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) answer was so prompt. <div class="bookquote">``Oh no. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s
beyond nothing. For she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) has had nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. You must have had things to be them. It's a kind of law of
perspective.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie didn't know about the law, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) continued definite. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s
not, for example, beyond help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well then, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) shall have all we can give her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). I'll write to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``with pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) answered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gaily and tenderly looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>).

<p/>True as this might be, however, there was one thing more--he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was an
angel with a human curiosity. <div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) told you she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) likes me much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) has told me--but I won't pamper you. Let it be enough for
you it has always been one of my reasons for liking HER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s indeed not beyond everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Verver more or less
humorously observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh it isn't, thank goodness, that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s in love with you. It's not, as
I told you at first, the sort of thing for you to fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had spoken with cheer, but it appeared to drop before this
reassurance, as if the latter overdid his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) alarm, and that should be
corrected. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, I've always thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) as a little girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s not a little girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll write to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) as a brilliant woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's exactly what she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver had got up as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) spoke, and for a little, before retracing
their steps, they stood looking at each other as if they had really
arranged something. They had come out together for themselves, but it
had produced something more. What it had produced was in fact expressed
by the words with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) companion's last emphasis. <div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
has a famous friend in you, Princess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie took this in--it was too plain for a protest. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know what
I'm really thinking of?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wondered, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)--eyes of contentment at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) freedom
now to talk; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wasn't such a fool, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) presently showed, as not,
suddenly, to arrive at it. <div class="bookquote">``Why, of your finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) at last yourself a
husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good for YOU!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie smiled. <div class="bookquote">``But it will take,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``some
looking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let me look right here with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father said as they walked
on.



<p/>XI

<p/>Mrs. Assingham and the Colonel, quitting Fawns before the end of
September, had come back later on; and now, a couple of weeks after,
they were again interrupting their stay, but this time with the question
of their return left to depend, on matters that were rather hinted at
than importunately named. The Lutches and Mrs. Rance had also, by the
action of Charlotte Stant's arrival, ceased to linger, though with hopes
and theories, as to some promptitude of renewal, of which the lively
expression, awakening the echoes of the great stone-paved, oak-panelled,
galleried hall that was not the least interesting feature of the place,
seemed still a property of the air. It was on this admirable spot that,
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) October afternoon had waned, Fanny Assingham spent with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
easy host a few moments which led to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) announcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
husband's final secession, at the same time as they tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) to point
the moral of all vain reverberations. The double door of the house
stood open to an effect of hazy autumn sunshine, a wonderful, windless,
waiting, golden hour, under the influence of which Adam Verver met his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
genial friend as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) came to drop into the post-box with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) own hand
a thick sheaf of letters. They presently thereafter left the house
together and drew out half-an-hour on the terrace in a manner they were
to revert to in thought, later on, as that of persons who really had
been taking leave of each other at a parting of the ways. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) traced his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
impression, on coming to consider, back to a mere three words she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
had begun by using about Charlotte Stant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) simply <div class="bookquote">``cleared them
out'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--those had been the three words, thrown off in reference to the
general golden peace that the Kentish October had gradually ushered in,
the <div class="bookquote">``halcyon''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>days the full beauty of which had appeared to shine out
for them after Charlotte's arrival. For it was during these days that
Mrs. Rance and the Miss Lutches had been observed to be gathering
themselves for departure, and it was with that difference made that the
sense of the whole situation showed most fair--the sense of how right
they had been to engage for so ample a residence, and of all the
pleasure so fruity an autumn there could hold in its lap. This was
what had occurred, that their lesson had been learned; and what Mrs.
Assingham had dwelt upon was that without Charlotte it would have been
learned but half. It would certainly not have been taught by Mrs. Rance
and the Miss Lutches if these ladies had remained with them as long as
at one time seemed probable. Charlotte's light intervention had thus
become a cause, operating covertly but none the less actively, and Fanny
Assingham's speech, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had followed up a little, echoed within
him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), fairly to startle him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), as the indication of something irresistible.
He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) could see now how this superior force had worked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) fairly liked
to recover the sight--little harm as he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) dreamed of doing, little ill
as he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) dreamed of wishing, the three ladies, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had after all
entertained for a stiffish series of days. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had been so vague and
quiet about it, wonderful Charlotte, that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hadn't known what was
happening--happening, that is, as a result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) influence. <div class="bookquote">``Their
fires, as they felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), turned to smoke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham remarked;
which he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was to reflect on indeed even while they strolled. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had
retained, since his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) long talk with Maggie--the talk that had settled the
matter of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) own direct invitation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend--an odd little taste,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) would have described it, for hearing things said about this young
woman, hearing, so to speak, what COULD be said about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): almost as it
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) portrait, by some eminent hand, were going on, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) watched it
grow under the multiplication of touches. Mrs. Assingham, it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>),
applied two or three of the finest in their discussion of their young
friend--so different a figure now from that early playmate of Maggie's
as to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could almost recall from of old the definite occasions
of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) having paternally lumped the two children together in the
recommendation that they shouldn't make too much noise nor eat too much
jam. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) companion professed that in the light of Charlotte's prompt
influence she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had not been a stranger to a pang of pity for their recent
visitors. <div class="bookquote">``I felt in fact, privately, so sorry for them, that I kept my
impression to myself while they were here--wishing not to put the rest
of you on the scent; neither Maggie, nor the Prince, nor yourself,
nor even Charlotte HERself, if you didn't happen to notice. Since you
didn't, apparently, I perhaps now strike you as extravagant. But I'm
not--I followed it all. One SAW the consciousness I speak of come over
the poor things, very much as I suppose people at the court of the
Borgias may have watched each other begin to look queer after having had
the honour of taking wine with the heads of the family. My comparison's
only a little awkward, for I don't in the least mean that Charlotte was
consciously dropping poison into their cup. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was just herself their
poison, in the sense of mortally disagreeing with them--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't
know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't know it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Verver had asked with interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I THINK she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>--Mrs. Assingham had to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
hadn't pressingly sounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't pretend to be sure, in every
connection, of what Charlotte knows. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) doesn't, certainly, like to
make people suffer--not, in general, as is the case with so many of us,
even other women: she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) likes much rather to put them at their ease with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) likes, that is--as all pleasant people do--to be liked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) likes to be liked?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion had gone on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did, at the same time, no doubt, want to help us--to put us at our
ease. That is she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wanted to put you--and to put Maggie about you. So far
as that went she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had a plan. But it was only AFTER--it was not before, I
really believe--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw how effectively she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Again, as Mr. Verver felt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) must have taken it up. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted to
help us?--wanted to help ME?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham asked after an instant, <div class="bookquote">``should it surprise you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) just thought. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, it doesn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw, of course, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) came, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) quickness, where we
all were. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't need each of us to go, by appointment, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) room
at night, or take her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) out into the fields, for our palpitating tale. No
doubt even she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was rather impatient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``OF the poor things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Verver had here inquired while he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) waited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, of your not yourselves being so--and of YOUR not in particular.
I haven't the least doubt in the world, par exemple, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thinks you
too meek.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thinks me too meek?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been sent for, on the very face of it, to work right in.
All she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had to do, after all, was to be nice to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To--a--ME?''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>said Adam Verver.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) could remember now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) friend had positively had a laugh for his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
tone. <div class="bookquote">``To you and to every one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had only to be what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is--and to
be it all round. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s charming, how can she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) help it? So it was, and
so only, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) `acted'-as the Borgia wine used to act. One saw it
come over them--the extent to which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) particular way, a woman, a
woman other, and SO other, than themselves, COULD be charming. One saw
them understand and exchange looks, then one saw them lose heart and
decide to move. For what they had to take home was that it's she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) who's
the real thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, it's she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) who's the real thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>HE</b></font>)</div>As HE (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had not hitherto taken it
home as completely as the Miss Lutches and Mrs. Rance, so, doubtless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
had now, a little, appeared to offer submission in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) appeal. <div class="bookquote">``I see,
I see'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) could at least simply take it home now; yet as not without
wanting, at the same time, to be sure of what the real thing was. <div class="bookquote">``And
what would it be--a--definitely that you understand by that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) had only for an instant not found it easy to say. <div class="bookquote">``Why, exactly what
those women themselves want to be, and what her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) effect on them is to
make them recognise that they never will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--of course never?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It not only remained and abode with them, it positively developed and
deepened, after this talk, that the luxurious side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) personal
existence was now again furnished, socially speaking, with the thing
classed and stamped as <div class="bookquote">``real'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had been able to think of it
as not otherwise enriched in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter's marriage. The
note of reality, in so much projected light, continued to have for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
the charm and the importance of which the maximum had occasionally been
reached in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) great <div class="bookquote">``finds'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--continued, beyond any other, to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
attentive and gratified. Nothing perhaps might affect us as queerer, had
we time to look into it, than this application of the same measure of
value to such different pieces of property as old Persian carpets, say,
and new human acquisitions; all the more indeed that the amiable man
was not without an inkling, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own side, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, as a taster
of life, economically constructed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) one little glass
everything he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) raised to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, and it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had always carried
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, like a tool of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trade, this receptacle, a little glass
cut with a fineness of which the art had long since been lost, and kept
in an old morocco case stamped in uneffaceable gilt with the arms of a
deposed dynasty. As it had served him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to satisfy himself, so to speak,
both about Amerigo and about the Bernadino Luini he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had happened to come
to knowledge of at the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was consenting to the announcement of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter's betrothal, so it served him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at present to satisfy himself
about Charlotte Stant and an extraordinary set of oriental tiles of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lately got wind, to which a provoking legend was attached,
and as to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made out, contentedly, that further news was to
be obtained from a certain Mr. Gutermann-Seuss of Brighton. It was all,
at bottom, in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>), the aesthetic principle, planted where it could burn
with a cold, still flame; where it fed almost wholly on the material
directly involved, on the idea -LRB-followed by appropriation-RRB- of plastic
beauty, of the thing visibly perfect in its kind; where, in short, in
spite of the general tendency of the <div class="bookquote">``devouring element''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to spread,
the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>) spiritual furniture, modest, scattered, and tended with
unconscious care, escaped the consumption that in so many cases proceeds
from the undue keeping-up of profane altar-fires. Adam Verver had in
other words learnt the lesson of the senses, to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) own
little book, without having, for a day, raised the smallest scandal
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) economy at large; being in this particular not unlike those
fortunate bachelors, or other gentlemen of pleasure, who so manage
their entertainment of compromising company that even the austerest
housekeeper, occupied and competent below-stairs, never feels obliged
to give warning.

<p/>That figure has, however, a freedom that the occasion doubtless scarce
demands, though we may retain it for its rough negative value. It was to
come to pass, by a pressure applied to the situation wholly from within,
that before the first ten days of November had elapsed he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) found himself
practically alone at Fawns with his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) young friend; Amerigo and Maggie
having, with a certain abruptness, invited his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) assent to their going
abroad for a month, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) amusement was now scarce less happily
assured than his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) security. An impulse eminently natural had stirred
within the Prince; his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) life, as for some time established, was
deliciously dull, and thereby, on the whole, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) best liked; but a
small gust of yearning had swept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), and Maggie repeated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father, with infinite admiration, the pretty terms in which, after it
had lasted a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had described to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) this experience. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) called
it a <div class="bookquote">``serenade,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>a low music that, outside one of the windows of the
sleeping house, disturbed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rest at night. Timid as it was, and
plaintive, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) yet couldn't close his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes for it, and when finally,
rising on tiptoe, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had looked out, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had recognised in the figure
below with a mandolin, all duskily draped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) grace, the raised
appealing eyes and the one irresistible voice of the ever-to-be-loved
Italy. Sooner or later, that way, one had to listen; it was a hovering,
haunting ghost, as of a creature to whom one had done a wrong, a dim,
pathetic shade crying out to be comforted. For this there was obviously
but one way--as there were doubtless also many words for the simple
fact that so prime a Roman had a fancy for again seeing Rome. They would
accordingly--hadn't they better?--go for a little; Maggie meanwhile
making the too-absurdly artful point with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
repeated it, in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) amusement, to Charlotte Stant, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was by
this time conscious of addressing many remarks, that it was absolutely,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) came to think, the first thing Amerigo had ever asked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doesn't count of course his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) having asked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>--
this was Mr. Verver's indulgent criticism; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) found Charlotte,
equally touched by the ingenuous Maggie, in easy agreement with him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) over
the question. If the Prince had asked something of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife every day
in the year, this would be still no reason why the poor dear man should
not, in a beautiful fit of homesickness, revisit, without reproach, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
native country.

<p/>What his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father-in-law frankly counselled was that the reasonable, the
really too reasonable, pair should, while they were about it, take three
or four weeks of Paris as well--Paris being always, for Mr. Verver, in
any stress of sympathy, a suggestion that rose of itself to the lips.
If they would only do that, on their way back, or however they preferred
it, Charlotte and he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) would go over to join them there for a small
look--though even then, assuredly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had it at heart to add, not in
the least because they should have found themselves bored at being left
together. The fate of this last proposal indeed was that it reeled,
for the moment, under an assault of destructive analysis from Maggie,
who--having, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) granted, to choose between being an unnatural
daughter or an unnatural mother, and <div class="bookquote">``electing''  (<font color='red'><b>an mother</b></font>)</div>for the former--wanted
to know what would become of the Principino if the house were cleared of
everyone but the servants. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) question had fairly resounded, but it had
afterwards, like many of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) questions, dropped still more effectively
than it had risen: the highest moral of the matter being, before the
couple took their departure, that Mrs. Noble and Dr. Brady must mount
unchallenged guard over the august little crib. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) hadn't supremely
believed in the majestic value of the nurse, whose experience was in
itself the amplest of pillows, just as her (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) attention was a spreading
canopy from which precedent and reminiscence dropped as thickly as
parted curtains--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) hadn't been able to rest in this confidence she (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>)
would fairly have sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) husband on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) journey without her (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>). In the
same manner, if the sweetest--for it was so she (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) qualified him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--of
little country doctors hadn't proved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wisdom by rendering
irresistible, especially on rainy days and in direct proportion to
the frequency of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) calls, adapted to all weathers, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) should
converse with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for hours over causes and consequences, over what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had found to answer with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) little five at home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) would have
drawn scant support from the presence of a mere grandfather and a mere
brilliant friend. These persons, accordingly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) own predominance
having thus, for the time, given way, could carry with a certain ease,
and above all with mutual aid, their consciousness of a charge. So far
as their office weighed they could help each other with it--which was
in fact to become, as Mrs. Noble herself loomed larger for them, not a
little of a relief and a diversion.

<p/>Mr. Verver met his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) young friend, at certain hours, in the day-nursery,
very much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had regularly met the child's fond mother--Charlotte
having, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) clearly considered, given Maggie equal pledges and
desiring never to fail of the last word for the daily letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
promised to write. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wrote with high fidelity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion
know, and the effect of it was, remarkably enough, that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) himself
didn't write. The reason of this was partly that Charlotte <div class="bookquote">``told all
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) also let him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) know she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did--and partly that
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) enjoyed feeling, as a consequence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was generally, quite
systematically, eased and, as they said, <div class="bookquote">``done''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for. Committed, as it
were, to this charming and clever young woman, who, by becoming for him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
a domestic resource, had become for him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) practically a new person--and
committed, especially, in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own house, which somehow made his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sense of
it a deeper thing--he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) took an interest in seeing how far the connection
could carry him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), could perhaps even lead him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), and in thus putting to the
test, for pleasant verification, what Fanny Assingham had said, at the
last, about the difference such a girl could make. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was really making
one now, in their simplified existence, and a very considerable one,
though there was no one to compare her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with, as there had been, so
usefully, for Fanny--no Mrs. Rance, no Kitty, no Dotty Lutch, to help
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>) to be felt, according to Fanny's diagnosis, as real. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was real,
decidedly, from other causes, and Mr. Verver grew in time even a little
amused at the amount of machinery Mrs. Assingham had seemed to see
needed for pointing it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was directly and immediately real, real on
a pleasantly reduced and intimate scale, and at no moments more so than
during those--at which we have just glanced--when Mrs. Noble made
them both together feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) alone, in the absence of the
queen-mother, was regent of the realm and governess of the heir. Treated
on such occasions as at best a pair of dangling and merely nominal
court-functionaries, picturesque hereditary triflers entitled to the
petites entrees but quite external to the State, which began and ended
with the Nursery, they could only retire, in quickened sociability,
to what was left them of the Palace, there to digest their gilded
insignificance and cultivate, in regard to the true Executive, such
snuff-taking ironies as might belong to rococo chamberlains moving among
china lap-dogs.

<p/>Every evening, after dinner, Charlotte Stant played to him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>); seated
at the piano and requiring no music, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) went through his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``favourite
things'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) had many favourites--with a facility that never failed,
or that failed but just enough to pick itself up at a touch from his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>)
fitful voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) could play anything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) could play everything--always
shockingly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) of course insisted, but always, by his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) own vague
measure, very much as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) might, slim, sinuous and strong, and
with practised passion, have been playing lawn-tennis or endlessly and
rhythmically waltzing. His (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) love of music, unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) other loves,
owned to vaguenesses, but while, on his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) comparatively shaded sofa, and
smoking, smoking, always smoking, in the great Fawns drawing-room as
everywhere, the cigars of his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) youth, rank with associations--while,
I say, he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) so listened to Charlotte's piano, where the score was ever
absent but, between the lighted candles, the picture distinct, the
vagueness spread itself about him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) like some boundless carpet, a surface
delightfully soft to the pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) interest. It was a manner of
passing the time that rather replaced conversation, but the air, at the
end, none the less, before they separated, had a way of seeming full
of the echoes of talk. They separated, in the hushed house, not quite
easily, yet not quite awkwardly either, with tapers that twinkled in the
large dark spaces, and for the most part so late that the last solemn
servant had been dismissed for the night.

<p/>Late as it was on a particular evening toward the end of October, there
had been a full word or two dropped into the still-stirring sea of other
voices--a word or two that affected our friend even at the moment, and
rather oddly, as louder and rounder than any previous sound; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had lingered, under pretext of an opened window to be made secure, after
taking leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) companion in the hall and watching her (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) glimmer away
up the staircase. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had for himself another impulse than to go to bed;
picking up a hat in the hall, slipping his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arms into a sleeveless cape
and lighting still another cigar, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turned out upon the terrace through
one of the long drawing-room windows and moved to and fro there for an
hour beneath the sharp autumn stars. It was where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had walked in the
afternoon sun with Fanny Assingham, and the sense of that other hour,
the sense of the suggestive woman herself, was before him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) again as, in
spite of all the previous degustation we have hinted at, it had not yet
been. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought, in a loose, an almost agitated order, of many things;
the power that was in them to agitate having been part of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) conviction
that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should not soon sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) truly felt for a while that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should
never sleep again till something had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); some light, some idea,
some mere happy word perhaps, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had begun to want, but had been
till now, and especially the last day or two, vainly groping for. <div class="bookquote">``Can
you really then come if we start early?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--that was practically all he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had said to the girl as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bedroom light. And <div class="bookquote">``Why in
the world not, when I've nothing else to do, and should, besides, so
immensely like it?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--this had as definitely been, on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side, the limit
of the little scene. There had in fact been nothing to call a scene,
even of the littlest, at all--though he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) perhaps didn't quite know why
something like the menace of one hadn't proceeded from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stopping
half-way upstairs to turn and say, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked down on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
promised to content herself, for their journey, with a toothbrush and
a sponge. There hovered about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), at all events, while he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) walked,
appearances already familiar, as well as two or three that were new, and
not the least vivid of the former connected itself with that sense of
being treated with consideration which had become for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), as we have
noted, one of the minor yet so far as there were any such, quite one of
the compensatory, incidents of being a father-in-law. It had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>),
up to now, that this particular balm was a mixture of which Amerigo, as
through some hereditary privilege, alone possessed the secret; so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) found himself wondering if it had come to Charlotte, who had
unmistakably acquired it, through the young man's having amiably passed
it on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) made use, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) so quietly grateful host, however this
might be, of quite the same shades of attention and recognition, was
mistress in an equal degree of the regulated, the developed art of
placing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) high in the scale of importance. That was even for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
thought a clumsy way of expressing the element of similarity in the
agreeable effect they each produced on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and it held him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a little
only because this coincidence in their felicity caused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vaguely to
connect or associate them in the matter of tradition, training, tact,
or whatever else one might call it. It might almost have been--if such
a link between them was to be imagined--that Amerigo had, a little,
<div class="bookquote">``coached''  (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div>or incited their young friend, or perhaps rather that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had
simply, as one of the signs of the general perfection Fanny Assingham
commended in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), profited by observing, during her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) short opportunity
before the start of the travellers, the pleasant application by the
Prince of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) personal system. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might wonder what exactly it was that
they so resembled each other in treating him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) like--from what noble and
propagated convention, in cases in which the exquisite <div class="bookquote">``importance''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was
to be neither too grossly attributed nor too grossly denied, they had
taken their specific lesson; but the difficulty was here of course that
one could really never know--couldn't know without having been one's
self a personage; whether a Pope, a King, a President, a Peer, a
General, or just a beautiful Author.

<p/>Before such a question, as before several others when they recurred, he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
would come to a pause, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) arms on the old parapet and losing
himself in a far excursion. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had as to so many of the matters in hand
a divided view, and this was exactly what made him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) reach out, in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
unrest, for some idea, lurking in the vast freshness of the night,
at the breath of which disparities would submit to fusion, and so,
spreading beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), make him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) floated. What he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) kept
finding himself return to, disturbingly enough, was the reflection,
deeper than anything else, that in forming a new and intimate tie
he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) should in a manner abandon, or at the best signally relegate, his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) should reduce to definite form the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had lost
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)--as was indeed inevitable--by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own marriage; he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) should reduce to
definite form the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) having incurred an injury, or at the
best an inconvenience, that required some makeweight and deserved some
amends. And he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) should do this the more, which was the great point, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) should appear to adopt, in doing it, the sentiment, in fact the very
conviction, entertained, and quite sufficiently expressed, by
Maggie herself, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) beautiful generosity, as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had
suffered--putting it with extravagance--at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put it with
extravagance the extravagance was yet sincere, for it came--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
put with extravagance too--from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) persistence, always, in thinking,
feeling, talking about him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), as young. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had had glimpses of moments
when to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thus, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) absolutely unforced compunction, one would
have supposed the special edge of the wrong she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) to consist
in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) having still before him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) years and years to groan under it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had sacrificed a parent, the pearl of parents, no older than herself:
it wouldn't so much have mattered if he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had been of common parental
age. That he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) wasn't, that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was just her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) extraordinary equal and
contemporary, this was what added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) act the long train of its
effect. Light broke for him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) at last, indeed, quite as a consequence
of the fear of breathing a chill upon this luxuriance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spiritual
garden. As at a turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) labyrinth he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) issue, which opened
out so wide, for the minute, that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) breath with wonder. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was
afterwards to recall how, just then, the autumn night seemed to clear to
a view in which the whole place, everything round him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), the wide terrace
where he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) stood, the others, with their steps, below, the gardens, the
park, the lake, the circling woods, lay there as under some strange
midnight sun. It all met him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) during these instants as a vast expanse of
discovery, a world that looked, so lighted, extraordinarily new, and in
which familiar objects had taken on a distinctness that, as if it had
been a loud, a spoken pretension to beauty, interest, importance, to
he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) scarce knew what, gave them an inordinate quantity of character and,
verily, an inordinate size. This hallucination, or whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) might
have called it, was brief, but it lasted long enough to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
gasping. The gasp of admiration had by this time, however, lost itself
in an intensity that quickly followed--the way the wonder of it, since
wonder was in question, truly had been the strange DELAY of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) vision.
He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had these several days groped and groped for an object that lay at
his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) feet and as to which his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) blindness came from his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) stupidly looking
beyond. It had sat all the while at his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) hearth-stone, whence it now
gazed up in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) face.

<p/>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had recognised it there everything became coherent. The sharp
point to which all his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) light converged was that the whole call of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
future to him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), as a father, would be in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) so managing that Maggie
would less and less appear to herself to have forsaken him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>). And it not
only wouldn't be decently humane, decently possible, not to make
this relief easy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--the idea shone upon him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), more than that, as
exciting, inspiring, uplifting. It fell in so beautifully with what
might be otherwise possible; it stood there absolutely confronted with
the material way in which it might be met. The way in which it might
be met was by his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) putting his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) child at peace, and the way to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at
peace was to provide for his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) future--that is for hers--by marriage, by
a marriage as good, speaking proportionately, as hers had been. As he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
fairly inhaled this measure of refreshment he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) tasted the meaning of
recent agitations. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had seen that Charlotte could contribute--what he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
hadn't seen was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could contribute TO. When it had all supremely
cleared up and he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had simply settled this service to his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) daughter well
before him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) as the proper direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) young friend's leisure, the
cool darkness had again closed round him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) moral lucidity was
constituted. It wasn't only moreover that the word, with a click, so
fitted the riddle, but that the riddle, in such perfection, fitted
the word. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) might have been equally in want and yet not have had his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
remedy. Oh, if Charlotte didn't accept him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), of course the remedy would
fail; but, as everything had fallen together, it was at least there to
be tried. And success would be great--that was his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) last throb--if the
measure of relief effected for Maggie should at all prove to have been
given by his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) own actual sense of felicity. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) really didn't know when in
his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had thought of anything happier. To think of it merely for
himself would have been, even as he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had just lately felt, even doing
all justice to that condition--yes, impossible. But there was a grand
difference in thinking of it for his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) child.



<p/>XII

<p/>It was at Brighton, above all, that this difference came out; it was
during the three wonderful days he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) spent there with Charlotte that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
had acquainted himself further--though doubtless not even now quite
completely--with the merits of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) majestic scheme. And while, moreover,
to begin with, he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) still but held his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) vision in place, steadying it
fairly with his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) hands, as he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had often steadied, for inspection, a
precarious old pot or kept a glazed picture in its right relation to
the light, the other, the outer presumptions in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) favour, those
independent of what he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) might himself contribute and that therefore, till
he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) should <div class="bookquote">``speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>remained necessarily vague--that quantity, I say,
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) as positively multiplying, as putting on, in the fresh
Brighton air and on the sunny Brighton front, a kind of tempting
palpability. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) liked, in this preliminary stage, to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) should
be able to <div class="bookquote">``speak''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) would; the word itself being romantic,
pressing for him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) the spring of association with stories and plays where
handsome and ardent young men, in uniforms, tights, cloaks, high-boots,
had it, in soliloquies, ever on their lips; and the sense on the first
day that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) should probably have taken the great step before the second
was over conduced already to make him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) say to his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) companion that they
must spend more than their mere night or two. At his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) ease on the ground
of what was before him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) at all events definitely desired to be, and it
was strongly his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was proceeding step by step. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was
acting--it kept coming back to that--not in the dark, but in the high
golden morning; not in precipitation, flurry, fever, dangers these of
the path of passion properly so called, but with the deliberation of a
plan, a plan that might be a thing of less joy than a passion, but that
probably would, in compensation for that loss, be found to have the
essential property, to wear even the decent dignity, of reaching further
and of providing for more contingencies. The season was, in local
parlance, <div class="bookquote">``on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>the elements were assembled; the big windy hotel, the
draughty social hall, swarmed with <div class="bookquote">``types,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>in Charlotte's constant
phrase, and resounded with a din in which the wild music of gilded and
befrogged bands, Croatian, Dalmatian, Carpathian, violently exotic and
nostalgic, was distinguished as struggling against the perpetual popping
of corks. Much of this would decidedly have disconcerted our friends if
it hadn't all happened, more preponderantly, to give them the brighter
surprise. The noble privacy of Fawns had left them--had left Mr. Verver
at least--with a little accumulated sum of tolerance to spend on the
high pitch and high colour of the public sphere. Fawns, as it had been
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), and as Maggie and Fanny Assingham had both attested, was out
of the world, whereas the scene actually about him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), with the very sea a
mere big booming medium for excursions and aquariums, affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) as so
plump in the conscious centre that nothing could have been more complete
for representing that pulse of life which they had come to unanimity
at home on the subject of their advisedly not hereafter forgetting.
The pulse of life was what Charlotte, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) way, at home, had lately
reproduced, and there were positively current hours when it might have
been open to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion to feel himself again indebted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for
introductions. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``brought''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), to put it crudely, but it was
almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) were herself, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) greater gaiety, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) livelier
curiosity and intensity, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) readier, happier irony, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) about
and showing him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) the place. No one, really, when he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) came to think, had
ever taken him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) about before--it had always been he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), of old, who took
others and who in particular took Maggie. This quickly fell into its
relation with him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) as part of an experience--marking for him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), no doubt,
what people call, considerately, a time of life; a new and pleasant
order, a flattered passive state, that might become--why shouldn't it?--
one of the comforts of the future.

<p/>Mr. Gutermann-Seuss proved, on the second day--our friend had waited
till then--a remarkably genial, a positively lustrous young man
occupying a small neat house in a quarter of the place remote from the
front and living, as immediate and striking signs testified, in the
bosom of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family. Our visitors found themselves introduced, by
the operation of close contiguity, to a numerous group of ladies and
gentlemen older and younger, and of children larger and smaller, who
mostly affected them as scarce less anointed for hospitality and
who produced at first the impression of a birthday party, of some
anniversary gregariously and religiously kept, though they subsequently
fell into their places as members of one quiet domestic circle,
preponderantly and directly indebted for their being, in fact, to Mr.
Gutermann-Seuss. To the casual eye a mere smart and shining youth of
less than thirty summers, faultlessly appointed in every particular, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>)
yet stood among his (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>) progeny--eleven in all, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>) confessed without a
sigh, eleven little brown clear faces, yet with such impersonal old eyes
astride of such impersonal old noses--while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>) entertained the great
American collector whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>) had so long hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>) might meet, and whose
charming companion, the handsome, frank, familiar young lady, presumably
Mrs. Verver, noticed the graduated offspring, noticed the fat,
ear-ringed aunts and the glossy, cockneyfied, familiar uncles,
inimitable of accent and assumption, and of an attitude of cruder
intention than that of the head of the firm; noticed the place in short,
noticed the treasure produced, noticed everything, as from the habit
of a person finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) account at any time, according to a wisdom well
learned of life, in almost any <div class="bookquote">``funny''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>impression. It really came home
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) friend on the spot that this free range of observation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>),
picking out the frequent funny with extraordinary promptness, would
verily henceforth make a different thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) of such experiences, of
the customary hunt for the possible prize, the inquisitive play of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
accepted monomania; which different thing could probably be a lighter
and perhaps thereby a somewhat more boisterously refreshing form
of sport. Such omens struck him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as vivid, in any case, when Mr.
Gutermann-Seuss, with a sharpness of discrimination he (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>) had at first
scarce seemed to promise, invited his (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>) eminent couple into another
room, before the threshold of which the rest of the tribe, unanimously
faltering, dropped out of the scene. The treasure itself here, the
objects on behalf of which Mr. Verver's interest had been booked,
established quickly enough their claim to engage the latter's attention;
yet at what point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) past did our friend's memory, looking back
and back, catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), in any such place, thinking so much less of wares
artfully paraded than of some other and quite irrelevant presence? Such
places were not strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) when they took the form of bourgeois
back-parlours, a trifle ominously grey and grim from their north light,
at watering-places prevailingly homes of humbug, or even when they wore
some aspect still less, if not perhaps still more, insidious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had
been everywhere, pried and prowled everywhere, going, on occasion, so
far as to risk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) believed, life, health and the very bloom of
honour; but where, while precious things, extracted one by one from
thrice-locked yet often vulgar drawers and soft satchels of old oriental
ilk, were impressively ranged before him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), had he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), till now, let himself,
in consciousness, wander like one of the vague?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) didn't betray it--ah THAT he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) knew; but two recognitions took place
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) at once, and one of them suffered a little in sweetness by the
confusion. Mr. Gutermann-Seuss had truly, for the crisis, the putting
down of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>) cards, a rare manner; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gutermann-Seuss</b></font>) was perfect master of what not to
say to such a personage as Mr. Verver while the particular importance
that dispenses with chatter was diffused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) movements themselves,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) repeated act of passage between a featureless mahogany meuble and a
table so virtuously disinterested as to look fairly smug under a cotton
cloth of faded maroon and indigo, all redolent of patriarchal teas.
The Damascene tiles, successively, and oh so tenderly, unmuffled and
revealed, lay there at last in their full harmony and their venerable
splendour, but the tribute of appreciation and decision was, while the
spectator considered, simplified to a point that but just failed of
representing levity on the part of a man who had always acknowledged
without shame, in such affairs, the intrinsic charm of what was called
discussion. The infinitely ancient, the immemorial amethystine blue of
the glaze, scarcely more meant to be breathed upon, it would seem, than
the cheek of royalty--this property of the ordered and matched array
had inevitably all its determination for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) submission was,
perhaps for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, of the quick mind alone, the
process really itself, in its way, as fine as the perfection perceived
and admired: every inch of the rest of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being given to the
foreknowledge that an hour or two later he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have <div class="bookquote">``spoken.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The
burning of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ships therefore waited too near to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handle his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
opportunity with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usual firm and sentient fingers--waited somehow in
the predominance of Charlotte's very person, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) being there exactly
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was, capable, as Mr. Gutermann-Seuss himself was capable, of the
right felicity of silence, but with an embracing ease, through it all,
that made deferred criticism as fragrant as some joy promised a lover by
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mistress, or as a big bridal bouquet held patiently behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) couldn't otherwise have explained, surely, why he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) found himself
thinking, to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) enjoyment, of so many other matters than the felicity
of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) acquisition and the figure of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) cheque, quite equally high; any
more than why, later on, with their return to the room in which they had
been received and the renewed encompassment of the tribe, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) felt quite
merged in the elated circle formed by the girl's free response to the
collective caress of all the shining eyes, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) genial acceptance
of the heavy cake and port wine that, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was afterwards to note,
added to their transaction, for a finish, the touch of some mystic rite
of old Jewry.

<p/>This characterisation came from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as they walked away--walked
together, in the waning afternoon, back to the breezy sea and the
bustling front, back to the nimble and the flutter and the shining shops
that sharpened the grin of solicitation on the mask of night. They were
walking thus, as he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt, nearer and nearer to where he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should see his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
ships burn, and it was meanwhile for him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) quite as if this red glow would
impart, at the harmonious hour, a lurid grandeur to his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good faith. It
was meanwhile too a sign of the kind of sensibility often playing up
in him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that--fabulous as this truth may sound--he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) found a sentimental
link, an obligation of delicacy, or perhaps even one of the penalties
of its opposite, in his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) having exposed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to the north light, the quite
properly hard business-light, of the room in which they had been alone
with the treasure and its master. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had listened to the name of
the sum he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was capable of looking in the face. Given the relation of
intimacy with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had already, beyond all retractation, accepted,
the stir of the air produced at the other place by that high figure
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) as a thing that, from the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had exclaimed or
protested as little as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) himself had apologised, left him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) but one thing
more to do. A man of decent feeling didn't thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money, a huge lump
of it, in such a way, under a poor girl's nose--a girl whose
poverty was, after a fashion, the very basis of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) enjoyment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hospitality--without seeing, logically, a responsibility attached. And
this was to remain none the less true for the fact that twenty minutes
later, after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had applied his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) torch, applied it with a sign or two of
insistence, what might definitely result failed to be immediately clear.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spoken--spoken as they sat together on the out-of-the-way bench
observed during one of their walks and kept for the previous quarter of
the present hour well in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memory's eye; the particular spot to which,
between intense pauses and intenser advances, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had all the while
consistently led her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Below the great consolidated cliff, well on to
where the city of stucco sat most architecturally perched, with the
rumbling beach and the rising tide and the freshening stars in front
and above, the safe sense of the whole place yet prevailed in lamps
and seats and flagged walks, hovering also overhead in the close
neighbourhood of a great replete community about to assist anew at the
removal of dish-covers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've had, as it seems to me, such quite beautiful days together, that
I hope it won't come to you too much as a shock when I ask if you think
you could regard me with any satisfaction as a husband.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
known she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of course couldn't, at all gracefully, and
whether or no, reply with a rush, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said a little more--quite as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had felt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must in thinking it out in advance. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had put the question
on which there was no going back and which represented thereby the
sacrifice of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vessels, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) further said was to stand for the
redoubled thrust of flame that would make combustion sure. <div class="bookquote">``This isn't
sudden to me, and I've wondered at moments if you haven't felt me coming
to it. I've been coming ever since we left Fawns--I really started while
we were there.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke slowly, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired, time to
think; all the more that it was making her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steadily, and
making her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also, in a remarkable degree, look <div class="bookquote">``well''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>while she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
so--a large and, so far, a happy, consequence. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasn't at all events
shocked--which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had glanced at but for a handsome humility--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would give her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as many minutes as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't think I'm
forgetting that I'm not young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that isn't so. It's I that am old. You ARE young.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This was what
she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had at first answered--and quite in the tone too of having taken
her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) minutes. It had not been wholly to the point, but it had been
kind--which was what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most wanted. And she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept, for her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next words,
to kindness, kept to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clear, lowered voice and unshrinking face.
<div class="bookquote">``To me too it thoroughly seems that these days have been beautiful. I
shouldn't be grateful to them if I couldn't more or less have imagined
their bringing us to this.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) somehow as if she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
advanced a step to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and yet were at the same time standing
still. It only meant, however, doubtless, that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, gravely and
reasonably, thinking--as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exactly desired to make her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
but think enough she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would probably think to suit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that it's for YOU to be sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I AM sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>said Adam Verver. <div class="bookquote">``On matters of importance I never
speak when I'm not. So if you can yourself FACE such a union you needn't
in the least trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had another pause, and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have been felt as facing it while,
through lamplight and dusk, through the breath of the mild, slightly
damp southwest, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) eyes without evasion. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had at the end
of another minute debated only to the extent of saying: <div class="bookquote">``I won't pretend
I don't think it would be good for me to marry. Good for me, I mean,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``because I'm so awfully unattached. I should like to be a
little less adrift. I should like to have a home. I should like to have
an existence. I should like to have a motive for one thing more than
another--a motive outside of myself. In fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, so sincerely
that it almost showed pain, yet so lucidly that it almost showed
humour, <div class="bookquote">``in fact, you know, I want to BE married. It's--well, it's the
condition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The condition--?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was just vague.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the state, I mean. I don't like my own. `Miss,' among us all,
is too dreadful--except for a shopgirl. I don't want to be a horrible
English old-maid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you want to be taken care of. Very well then, I'll do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it's very much that. Only I don't see why, for what I speak
of,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled--<div class="bookquote">``for a mere escape from my state--I need do quite so
MUCH.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much as marry me in particular?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smile was as for true directness. <div class="bookquote">``I might get what I want for
less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think it so much for you to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presently said, <div class="bookquote">``I think it's a great deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then it was that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so gentle, so quite perfect with him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had come on far--then it was that of a sudden something
seemed to fail and he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) didn't quite know where they were. There rose for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), with this, the fact, to be sure, of their disparity, deny it as
mercifully and perversely as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) might have been her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course, yes--that's my disadvantage: I'm not the natural, I'm so
far from being the ideal match to your youth and your beauty. I've the
drawback that you've seen me always, so inevitably, in such another
light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave a slow headshake that made contradiction soft--made it
almost sad, in fact, as from having to be so complete; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had
already, before she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke, the dim vision of some objection in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind
beside which the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had named was light, and which therefore must be
strangely deep. <div class="bookquote">``You don't understand me. It's of all that it is for YOU
to do--it's of that I'm thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, with this, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), the thing was clearer! <div class="bookquote">``Then you needn't think.
I know enough what it is for me to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head again. <div class="bookquote">``I doubt if you know. I doubt if you CAN.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not, please--when I've had you so before me? That I'm old has
at least THAT fact about it to the good--that I've known you long and
from far back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think you've `known' me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>asked Charlotte Stant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
hesitated--for the tone of it, and her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look with it might have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
doubt. Just these things in themselves, however, with all the rest, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) fixed purpose now, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) committed deed, the fine pink glow,
projected forward, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) ships, behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), definitely blazing and
crackling--this quantity was to push him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) harder than any word of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
could warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>). All that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was herself, moreover, was so lighted, to
its advantage, by the pink glow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wasn't rabid, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wasn't either,
as a man of a proper spirit, to be frightened. <div class="bookquote">``What is that then--if
I accept it--but as strong a reason as I can want for just LEARNING to
know you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) always--kept it up as for honesty, and yet at the same
time, in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) odd way, as for mercy. <div class="bookquote">``How can you tell whether if you did
you would?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was ambiguous for an instant, as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) showed she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt. <div class="bookquote">``I mean when
it's a question of learning, one learns sometimes too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's a question,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) promptly enough made answer, <div class="bookquote">``of liking
you the more just for your saying these things. You should make
something,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``of my liking you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I make everything. But are you sure of having exhausted all other
ways?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This, of a truth, enlarged his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) gaze. <div class="bookquote">``But what other ways?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you've more ways of being kind than anyone I ever knew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``that I'm simply putting them all together
for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), on this, long again--still as if it
shouldn't be said she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't given him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) time or had withdrawn from his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
view, so to speak, a single inch of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) surface. This at least she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
fully to have exposed. It represented her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as oddly conscientious, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
scarce knew in what sense it affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>). On the whole, however, with
admiration. <div class="bookquote">``You're very, very honourable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just what I want to be. I don't see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``why you're
not right, I don't see why you're not happy, as you are. I can not ask
myself, I can not ask YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``if you're really as much at
liberty as your universal generosity leads you to assume. Oughtn't
we,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``to think a little of others? Oughtn't I, at least,
in loyalty--at any rate in delicacy--to think of Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With which,
intensely gentle, so as not to appear too much to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) duty,
she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s everything to you--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has always been. Are you so
certain that there's room in your life--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For another daughter?--is that what you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not hung upon it
long, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had quickly taken her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had not, however, disconcerted her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``For another young woman--very
much of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) age, and whose relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has always been so different
from what our marrying would make it. For another companion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>said
Charlotte Stant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't a man be, all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) almost fiercely asked, <div class="bookquote">``anything
but a father?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) went on before she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) could answer. <div class="bookquote">``You talk about
differences, but they've been already made--as no one knows better than
Maggie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feels the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made herself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own marriage--made, I
mean, for me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) constantly thinks of it--it allows her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) no rest. To put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at peace is therefore,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``what I'm trying, with you,
to do. I can't do it alone, but I can do it with your help. You can make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``positively happy about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) thoughtfully echoed. <div class="bookquote">``But what can I make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) about
herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s at ease about me the rest will take care of itself. The
case,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) declared, <div class="bookquote">``is in your hands. You'll effectually put out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
mind that I feel she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has abandoned me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Interest certainly now was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had kindled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) face, but it was
all the more honourable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had just called it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) should
want to see each of the steps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) conviction. <div class="bookquote">``If you've been driven
to the `likes' of me, mayn't it show that you've felt truly forsaken?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm willing to suggest that, if I can show at the same time that
I feel consoled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But HAVE you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) demanded, <div class="bookquote">``really felt so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Consoled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forsaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I haven't. But if it's her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) idea--!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>If it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) idea, in short,
that was enough. This enunciation of motive, the next moment, however,
sounded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) perhaps slightly thin, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) gave it another touch.
<div class="bookquote">``That is if it's my idea. I happen, you see, to like my idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's beautiful and wonderful. But isn't it, possibly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte
asked, <div class="bookquote">``not quite enough to marry me for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so, my dear child? Isn't a man's idea usually what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does marry
for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte, considering, looked as if this might perhaps be a large
question, or at all events something of an extension of one they were
immediately concerned with. <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't that a good deal depend on the sort
of thing it may be?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) suggested that, about marriage, ideas, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
called them, might differ; with which, however, giving no more time to
it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sounded another question. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you appear rather to put it to
me that I may accept your offer for Maggie's sake? Somehow'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) turned
it over--<div class="bookquote">``I don't so clearly SEE her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) quite so much finding reassurance,
or even quite so much needing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you then make nothing at all of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) having been so ready to leave
us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah, Charlotte on the contrary made much! <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was ready to leave us
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had to be. From the moment the Prince wanted it she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could
only go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly--so that, if you see your way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) will be able to `go with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)' in future as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte appeared to examine for a minute, in Maggie's interest,
this privilege--the result of which was a limited concession. <div class="bookquote">``You've
certainly worked it out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I've worked it out--that's exactly what I HAVE done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
hadn't for a long time been so happy about anything as at your being
there with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was to be with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) security.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>Adam Verver rang out, <div class="bookquote">``this IS her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) security. You've only, if you
can't see it, to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div><p/>```Ask' her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)?''--the girl echoed it in wonder. <div class="bookquote">``Certainly--in so many
words. Telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) you don't believe me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) debated. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean write it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so. Immediately. To-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't think I can write it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte Stant. <div class="bookquote">``When I write
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) looked amused for so different a shade--<div class="bookquote">``it's about
the Principino's appetite and Dr. Brady's visits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good then--put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face to face. We'll go straight to Paris
to meet them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte, at this, rose with a movement that was like a small cry; but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) unspoken sense lost itself while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) seat as for the help it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), a little, to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
appeal go up. Presently, however, a new sense had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
covered him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), kindly, with the expression of it. <div class="bookquote">``I do think, you know,
you must rather `like' me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>said Adam Verver. <div class="bookquote">``You WILL put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) yourself then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had another hesitation. <div class="bookquote">``We go over, you say, to meet them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as we can get back to Fawns. And wait there for them, if
necessary, till they come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait--a--at Fawns?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait in Paris. That will be charming in itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You take me to pleasant places.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) turned it over. <div class="bookquote">``You propose to me
beautiful things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It rests but with you to make them beautiful and pleasant. You've made
Brighton--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) almost tenderly protested. <div class="bookquote">``With what I'm doing now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're promising me now what I want. Aren't you promising me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
pressed, getting up, <div class="bookquote">``aren't you promising me to abide by what Maggie
says?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wanted to be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll ASK it of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) indeed, as by communication, a sense of the propriety of
being himself certain. Yet what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) but certain? <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll speak to
you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll speak to you FOR me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>This at last then seemed to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Very good. May we wait again
to talk of it till she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has done so?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) showed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) hands down in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) shoulders expressively up, a certain disappointment.
Soon enough, none the less, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) gentleness was all back and his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) patience
once more exemplary. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I give you time. Especially,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) smiled,
<div class="bookquote">``as it's time that I shall be spending with you. Our keeping on together
will help you perhaps to see. To see, I mean, how I need you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I already see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``how you've persuaded yourself you do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had to repeat it. <div class="bookquote">``That isn't, unfortunately, all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, how you'll make Maggie right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Right'?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) echoed it as if the word went far. And <div class="bookquote">``O--oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) still
critically murmured as they moved together away.



<p/>XIII

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) of their waiting in Paris, a week later, but on
the spot there this period of patience suffered no great strain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had
written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter, not indeed from Brighton, but directly after
their return to Fawns, where they spent only forty-eight hours before
resuming their journey; and Maggie's reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) news was a telegram
from Rome, delivered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) at noon of their fourth day and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
brought out to Charlotte, who was seated at that moment in the court
of the hotel, where they had agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) should join her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for their
proceeding together to the noontide meal. His (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) letter, at Fawns--a letter
of several pages and intended lucidly, unreservedly, in fact all but
triumphantly, to inform--had proved, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) sitting down to it, and a
little to his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) surprise, not quite so simple a document to frame as
even his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) due consciousness of its weight of meaning had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) to
assume: this doubtless, however, only for reasons naturally latent in
the very wealth of that consciousness, which contributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) message
something of their own quality of impatience. The main result of their
talk, for the time, had been a difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) relation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) young
friend, as well as a difference, equally sensible, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) relation
to himself; and this in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) not having again renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
undertaking to <div class="bookquote">``speak''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>to her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) so far even as to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) of the
communication despatched to Rome. Delicacy, a delicacy more beautiful
still, all the delicacy she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) should want, reigned between them--it being
rudimentary, in their actual order, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) mustn't be further worried
until Maggie should have put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ease.

<p/>It was just the delicacy, however, that in Paris--which, suggestively,
was Brighton at a hundredfold higher pitch--made, between him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
companion, the tension, made the suspense, made what he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) would have
consented perhaps to call the provisional peculiarity, of present
conditions. These elements acted in a manner of their own, imposing
and involving, under one head, many abstentions and precautions, twenty
anxieties and reminders--things, verily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) would scarce have known
how to express; and yet creating for them at every step an acceptance of
their reality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was hanging back, with Charlotte, till another person
should intervene for their assistance, and yet they had, by what had
already occurred, been carried on to something it was out of the
power of other persons to make either less or greater. Common
conventions--that was what was odd--had to be on this basis more thought
of; those common conventions that, previous to the passage by the
Brighton strand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had so enjoyed the sense of their overlooking. The
explanation would have been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) supposed--or would have figured it with
less of unrest--that Paris had, in its way, deeper voices and warnings,
so that if you went at all <div class="bookquote">``far''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>there it laid bristling traps, as they
might have been viewed, all smothered in flowers, for your going further
still. There were strange appearances in the air, and before you knew
it you might be unmistakably matching them. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wished therefore
to match no appearance but that of a gentleman playing with perfect
fairness any game in life he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) might be called to, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) found himself, on
the receipt of Maggie's missive, rejoicing with a certain inconsistency.
The announcement made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from home had, in the act, cost some biting of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) pen to sundry parts of him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) personal modesty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) imagination
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) prepared state for so quick a jump, it didn't much matter
which--and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was more eager than not for the drop of delay and for
the quicker transitions promised by the arrival of the imminent pair.
There was after all a hint of offence to a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age in being
taken, as they said at the shops, on approval. Maggie, certainly, would
have been as far as Charlotte herself from positively desiring this,
and Charlotte, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) side, as far as Maggie from holding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) light as
a real value. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fidget thus, poor girl, but from generous
rigour of conscience.

<p/>These allowances of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spirit were, all the same, consistent with a
great gladness at the sight of the term of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ordeal; for it was the
end of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seeming to agree that questions and doubts had a place. The
more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had inwardly turned the matter over the more it had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
that they had in truth only an ugliness. What he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have best borne,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now believed, would have been Charlotte's simply saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enough. This he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't have enjoyed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would quite have understood it and been able ruefully to submit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
did like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enough--nothing to contradict that had come out for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was restless for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as well as for himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hard a moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) telegram, and the look, for what
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fancied a dim, shy fear in it, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best moment of
conviction that--as a man, so to speak--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) properly pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said
nothing--the words sufficiently did it for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), doing it again better
still as Charlotte, who had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) chair at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approach, murmured
them out. <div class="bookquote">``We start to-night to bring you all our love and joy and
sympathy.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There they were, the words, and what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) want more? She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
didn't, however, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back the little unfolded leaf, say
they were enough--though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw, the next moment, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) silence was
probably not disconnected from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) having just visibly turned pale.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) extraordinarily fine eyes, as it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present theory that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
always thought them, shone at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the more darkly out of this change
of colour; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had again, with it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) apparent way of subjecting
herself, for explicit honesty and through her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) willingness to face him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
to any view he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might take, all at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ease, and even to wantonness, of
the condition he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) produced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perceived that emotion
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) soundless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew himself deeply touched, since it proved that,
little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) professed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been beautifully hoping. They stood
there a minute while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took in from this sign that, yes then, certainly
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enough--liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), old as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ready
to brand himself, flush for the pleasure of it. The pleasure of it
accordingly made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speak first. <div class="bookquote">``Do you begin, a little, to be
satisfied?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Still, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had to think. <div class="bookquote">``We've hurried them, you see. Why so
breathless a start?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because they want to congratulate us. They want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>said Adam Verver, <div class="bookquote">``to
SEE our happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wondered again--and this time also, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), as publicly as
possible. <div class="bookquote">``So much as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think it's too much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) continued to think plainly. <div class="bookquote">``They weren't to have started for
another week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what then? Isn't our situation worth the little sacrifice? We'll
go back to Rome as soon as you like WITH them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This seemed to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had previously seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) held, just a
trifle inscrutably, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) allusions to what they would do together on a
certain contingency. <div class="bookquote">``Worth it, the little sacrifice, for whom? For us,
naturally--yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We want to see them--for our reasons. That
is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) rather dimly smiled, <div class="bookquote">``YOU do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you do, my dear, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) bravely declared. <div class="bookquote">``Yes then--I do too,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) after an instant ungrudging enough acknowledged. <div class="bookquote">``For us, however,
something depends on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather! But does nothing depend on it for them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What CAN--from the moment that, as appears, they don't want to nip
us in the bud? I can imagine their rushing up to prevent us. But an
enthusiasm for us that can wait so very little--such intense eagerness,
I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``more than a little puzzles me. You may think
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) also added, <div class="bookquote">``ungracious and suspicious, but the Prince can't
at all want to come back so soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wanted quite too intensely to get
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver considered. <div class="bookquote">``Well, hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) been away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, just long enough to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) likes it. Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte,
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) may not be able to join in the rosy view of our case that you impute
to her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). It can't in the least have appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hitherto a matter of
course that you should give his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife a bouncing stepmother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Adam Verver, at this, looked grave. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid then he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)'ll just have
to accept from us whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife accepts; and accept it--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) can
imagine no better reason--just because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does. That,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) declared,
<div class="bookquote">``will have to do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) tone made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for a moment meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) face; after which, <div class="bookquote">``Let me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
abruptly said, <div class="bookquote">``see it again'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--taking from him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) the folded leaf that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had given back and he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had kept in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't the whole thing,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) asked when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had read it over, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps but a way like another for
their gaining time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) again stood staring; but the next minute, with that upward spring of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) shoulders and that downward pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) pockets which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
already, more than once, at disconcerted moments, determined in him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
turned sharply away and wandered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) looked about
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) small despair; he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) crossed the hotel court, which, overarched and
glazed, muffled against loud sounds and guarded against crude sights,
heated, gilded, draped, almost carpeted, with exotic trees in tubs,
exotic ladies in chairs, the general exotic accent and presence
suspended, as with wings folded or feebly fluttering, in the superior,
the supreme, the inexorably enveloping Parisian medium, resembled some
critical apartment of large capacity, some <div class="bookquote">``dental,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>medical, surgical
waiting-room, a scene of mixed anxiety and desire, preparatory, for
gathered barbarians, to the due amputation or extraction of excrescences
and redundancies of barbarism. He (<font color='blue'><b>ladies</b></font>) went as far as the porte-cochere,
took counsel afresh of his (<font color='blue'><b>ladies</b></font>) usual optimism, sharpened even, somehow,
just here, by the very air he (<font color='blue'><b>ladies</b></font>) tasted, and then came back smiling to
Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">``It is incredible to you that when a man is still as much in
love as Amerigo his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most natural impulse should be to feel what his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife
feels, to believe what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) believes, to want what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wants?--in the
absence, that is, of special impediments to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so doing.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The manner
of it operated--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) acknowledged with no great delay this natural
possibility. <div class="bookquote">``No--nothing is incredible to me of people immensely in
love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, isn't Amerigo immensely in love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hesitated but as for the right expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sense of the
degree--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) after all adopted Mr. Verver's. <div class="bookquote">``Immensely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had another smile, however--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wasn't there quite yet. <div class="bookquote">``That isn't
all that's wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife shall have made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really believe that SHE really
believes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>With which Charlotte became still more lucidly logical. <div class="bookquote">``The
reality of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belief will depend in such a case on the reality of hers.
The Prince may for instance now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``have made out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
satisfaction that Maggie may mainly desire to abound in your sense,
whatever it is you do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) may remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) has never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) do
anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>said Adam Verver, <div class="bookquote">``what kind of a warning will he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) have found in
that? To what catastrophe will he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) have observed such a disposition in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to lead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just to THIS one!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) as rising straighter and
clearer before him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had done even yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our little question itself?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) appearance had in fact, at the moment,
such an effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) could answer but in marvelling mildness.
<div class="bookquote">``Hadn't we better wait a while till we call it a catastrophe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) rejoinder to this was to wait--though by no means as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
meant. When at the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spoke, however, it was mildly
too. <div class="bookquote">``What would you like, dear friend, to wait for?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It lingered
between them in the air, this demand, and they exchanged for the time
a look which might have made each of them seem to have been watching in
the other the signs of its overt irony. These were indeed immediately so
visible in Mr. Verver's face that, as if a little ashamed of having
so markedly produced them--and as if also to bring out at last, under
pressure, something she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had all the while been keeping back--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) took
a jump to pure plain reason. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't noticed for yourself, but I
can't quite help noticing, that in spite of what you assume--WE assume,
if you like--Maggie wires her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) joy only to you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) makes no sign of its
overflow to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a point--and, staring a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) took account of it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
had, as before, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) presence of mind--to say nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) kindly
humour. <div class="bookquote">``Why, you complain of the very thing that's most charmingly
conclusive! She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) treats us already as ONE.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Clearly now, for the girl, in spite of lucidity and logic, there was
something in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) said things--! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) in all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) desire
to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), and then her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) word quite simply and definitely showed it.
<div class="bookquote">``I do like you, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, what could this do but stimulate his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) humour? <div class="bookquote">``I see what's the
matter with you. You won't be quiet till you've heard from the Prince
himself. I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the happy man added, <div class="bookquote">``that I'll go and secretly wire
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) that you'd like, reply paid, a few words for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>It could apparently but encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) further to smile. <div class="bookquote">``Reply paid for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), you mean--or for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'll pay, with pleasure, anything back for you--as many words as
you like.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) went on, to keep it up. <div class="bookquote">``Not requiring either to see
your message.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could take it, visibly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) meant it. <div class="bookquote">``Should you require to see
the Prince's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit. You can keep that also to yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) speaking, however, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) transmitting the hint were a
real question, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) appeared to consider--and almost as if for good
taste--that the joke had gone far enough. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter. Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
speaks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own movement--! And why should it be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``a thing
that WOULD occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Verver concurred, <div class="bookquote">``that it naturally wouldn't. HE (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
doesn't know you're morbid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) just wondered--but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) agreed. <div class="bookquote">``No--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hasn't yet found it out.
Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) will, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hasn't yet; and I'm willing to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
meanwhile the benefit of the doubt.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So with this the situation, to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
view, would appear to have cleared had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not too quickly had one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) restless relapses. <div class="bookquote">``Maggie, however, does know I'm morbid. SHE
hasn't the benefit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>said Adam Verver a little wearily at last, <div class="bookquote">``I think I feel
that you'll hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>It had even fairly come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), under
recurrent suggestion, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter's omission WAS surprising. And
Maggie had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life been wrong for more than three minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it isn't that I hold that I've a RIGHT to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte the next
instant rather oddly qualified--and the observation itself gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) a
further push.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--I shall like it myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>At this then, as if moved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) way of constantly--and more or less
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) own contention--coming round to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) showed how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
could also always, and not less gently, come half way. <div class="bookquote">``I speak of it
only as the missing GRACE--the grace that's in everything that Maggie
does. It isn't my due'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) kept it up--<div class="bookquote">``but, taking from you that we
may still expect it, it will have the touch. It will be beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come out to breakfast.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Verver had looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``It
will be here when we get back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it isn't'' (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>--and Charlotte smiled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looked about for a feather
boa that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had laid down on descending from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) room--<div class="bookquote">``if it isn't it
will have had but THAT slight fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) boa on the arm of the chair from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had moved to
meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), and, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had fetched it, raising it to make its charming
softness brush his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) face--for it was a wondrous product of Paris,
purchased under his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) direct auspices the day before--he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) held it there a
minute before giving it up. <div class="bookquote">``Will you promise me then to be at peace?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looked, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) debated, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) admirable present. <div class="bookquote">``I promise
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite for ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) went on, to justify his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) demand, <div class="bookquote">``remember that in wiring
you she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll naturally speak even more for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) husband than she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has done

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was only at a word that Charlotte had a demur. ```Naturally'--?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, our marriage puts him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for you, you see--or puts you for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--into
a new relation, whereas it leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) relation to me unchanged. It
therefore gives him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) more to say to you about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About its making me his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stepmother-in-law--or whatever I SHOULD
become?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Over which, for a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) not undivertedly mused. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
there may easily be enough for a gentleman to say to a young woman about
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Amerigo can always be, according to the case, either as funny or
as serious as you like; and whichever he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) may be for you, in sending you
a message, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'ll be it ALL.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl looks</b></font>)</div>And then as the girl, with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) so
deeply and oddly, yet so tenderly, critical looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), failed to take
up the remark, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) found himself moved, as by a vague anxiety, to add a
question. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s charming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, charming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte Stant. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) weren't I shouldn't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more should I!''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) friend harmoniously returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but you DON'T mind. You don't have to. You don't have to, I mean,
as I have. It's the last folly ever to care, in an anxious way, the
least particle more than one is absolutely forced. If I were you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)
went on--<div class="bookquote">``if I had in my life, for happiness and power and peace, even
a small fraction of what you have, it would take a great deal to make me
waste my worry. I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what in the world--that didn't
touch my luck--I should trouble my head about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite understand you--yet doesn't it just depend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Verver asked,
<div class="bookquote">``on what you call one's luck? It's exactly my luck that I'm talking
about. I shall be as sublime as you like when you've made me all right.
It's only when one is right that one really has the things you speak of.
It isn't they,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``that make one so: it's the something else
I want that makes THEM right. If you'll give me what I ask, you'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) boa and thrown it over her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) shoulders, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) eyes,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) still delayed, had turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), engaged by another
interest, though the court was by this time, the hour of dispersal for
luncheon, so forsaken that they would have had it, for free talk, should
they have been moved to loudness, quite to themselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) was ready
for their adjournment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) was also aware of a pedestrian youth,
in uniform, a visible emissary of the Postes et Telegraphes, who had
approached, from the street, the small stronghold of the concierge and
who presented there a missive taken from the little cartridge-box slung
over his (<font color='blue'><b>emissary</b></font>) shoulder. The portress, meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>emissary</b></font>) on the threshold, met
equally, across the court, Charlotte's marked attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>emissary</b></font>) visit,
so that, within the minute, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had advanced to our friends with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
cap-streamers flying and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smile of announcement as ample as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
broad white apron. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) raised aloft a telegraphic message and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
delivered it, sociably discriminated. <div class="bookquote">``Cette fois-ci pour madame!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--with
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as genially retreated, leaving Charlotte in possession.
Charlotte, taking it, held it at first unopened. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes had come back
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion, who had immediately and triumphantly greeted it. <div class="bookquote">``Ah,
there you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) broke the envelope then in silence, and for a minute, as with the
message he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) himself had put before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), studied its contents without
a sign. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) without a question, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looked up.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll give you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) simply said, <div class="bookquote">``what you ask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) face was strange--but since when had a woman's at
moments of supreme surrender not a right to be? He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) took it in with his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
own long look and his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) grateful silence--so that nothing more, for some
instants, passed between them. Their understanding sealed itself--he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
already felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) right. But he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was in presence too
of the fact that Maggie had made HER so; and always, therefore, without
Maggie, where, in fine, would he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) be? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) united them, brought them
together as with the click of a silver spring, and, on the spot, with
the vision of it, his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) eyes filled, Charlotte facing him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) meanwhile with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) expression made still stranger by the blur of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) gratitude. Through
it all, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``What my child does for me--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Through it all as well, that is still through the blur, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) saw
Charlotte, rather than heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) paper wide open,
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes were all for his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It isn't Maggie. It's the Prince.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I SAY!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) gaily rang out. <div class="bookquote">``Then it's best of all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you for thinking so!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) added <div class="bookquote">``It's enough for
our question, but it isn't--is it? quite enough for our breakfast?
Dejeunons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stood there, however, in spite of this appeal, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) document always
before them. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you want to read it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Not if it satisfies you. I don't require it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), as for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) conscience, another chance. <div class="bookquote">``You can if you
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hesitated afresh, but as for amiability, not for curiosity. <div class="bookquote">``Is it
funny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus, finally, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) again dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes on it, drawing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lips a
little. <div class="bookquote">``No--I call it grave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then, I don't want it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte Stant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what did I tell you of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) asked, rejoicing, as they
started: a question for all answer to which, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) arm,
the girl thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) paper, crumpled, into the pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) coat.




<p/>PART THIRD

<p/>XIV

<p/>Charlotte, half way up the <div class="bookquote">``monumental''  (<font color='red'><b>PART THIRD XIV Charlotte way</b></font>)</div>staircase, had begun by waiting
alone--waiting to be rejoined by her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion, who had gone down all
the way, as in common kindness bound, and who, his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) duty performed, would
know where to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was meanwhile, though extremely apparent,
not perhaps absolutely advertised; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would not have cared if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had been--so little was it, by this time, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) first occasion of facing
society with a consciousness materially, with a confidence quite
splendidly, enriched. For a couple of years now she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had known as never
before what it was to look <div class="bookquote">``well'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--to look, that is, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
always felt, from far back, that, in certain conditions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might.
On such an evening as this, that of a great official party in the
full flush of the London spring-time, the conditions affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
nerves, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) senses, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) imagination, as all profusely present; so that
perhaps at no moment yet had she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) been so justified of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) faith as at
the particular instant of our being again concerned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), that of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) chancing to glance higher up from where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stood and meeting in
consequence the quiet eyes of Colonel Assingham, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) elbows on
the broad balustrade of the great gallery overhanging the staircase and
who immediately exchanged with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) most artlessly familiar
signals. This simplicity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) visual attention struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), even with
the other things she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had to think about, as the quietest note in the
whole high pitch--much, in fact, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had pressed a finger on a
chord or a key and created, for the number of seconds, an arrest of
vibration, a more muffled thump. The sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) suggested indeed that
Fanny would be there, though so far as opportunity went she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). This was about the limit of what it could suggest.

<p/>The air, however, had suggestions enough--it abounded in them, many of
them precisely helping to constitute those conditions with which, for
our young woman, the hour was brilliantly crowned. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was herself in
truth crowned, and it all hung together, melted together, in light and
colour and sound: the unsurpassed diamonds that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head so happily
carried, the other jewels, the other perfections of aspect and
arrangement that made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) personal scheme a success, the PROVED private
theory that materials to work with had been all she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) required and that
there were none too precious for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to understand and use--to which
might be added lastly, as the strong-scented flower of the total
sweetness, an easy command, a high enjoyment, of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crisis. For a
crisis she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was ready to take it, and this ease it was, doubtless, that
helped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waited, to the right assurance, to the right
indifference, to the right expression, and above all, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt,
to the right view of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opportunity for happiness--unless indeed the
opportunity itself, rather, were, in its mere strange amplitude, the
producing, the precipitating cause. The ordered revellers, rustling and
shining, with sweep of train and glitter of star and clink of sword, and
yet, for all this, but so imperfectly articulate, so vaguely vocal--the
double stream of the coming and the going, flowing together where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
stood, passed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), brushed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), treated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to much crude contemplation
and now and then to a spasm of speech, an offered hand, even in some
cases to an unencouraged pause; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) missed no countenance and
invited no protection: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fairly liked to be, so long as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might,
just as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was--exposed a little to the public, no doubt, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
unaccompanied state, but, even if it were a bit brazen, careless of
queer reflections on the dull polish of London faces, and exposed, since
it was a question of exposure, to much more competent recognitions
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hoped no one would stop--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was positively keeping
herself; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) idea to mark in a particular manner the importance
of something that had just happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should mark it,
and what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was doing there made already a beginning.

<p/>When presently, therefore, from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) standpoint, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw the Prince come
back she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had an impression of all the place as higher and wider and
more appointed for great moments; with its dome of lustres lifted,
its ascents and descents more majestic, its marble tiers more vividly
overhung, its numerosity of royalties, foreign and domestic, more
unprecedented, its symbolism of <div class="bookquote">``State''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>hospitality both emphasised and
refined. This was doubtless a large consequence of a fairly familiar
cause, a considerable inward stir to spring from the mere vision,
striking as that might be, of Amerigo in a crowd; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
reasons, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held them there, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carried them in fact, responsibly and
overtly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) high tiara, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) folded fan, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
indifferent, unattended eminence; and it was when he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
could, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) arm, show herself as placed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) relation, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
felt supremely justified. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) notion of course that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave a
glimpse of but few of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grounds for this discrimination--indeed of the
most evident alone; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have been half willing it should be
guessed how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew inspiration, drew support, in quantity sufficient
for almost anything, from the individual value that, through all the
picture, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's son-in-law kept for the eye, deriving it from
his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) fine unconscious way, in the swarming social sum, of outshining,
overlooking and overtopping. It was as if in separation, even the
shortest, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) half forgot or disbelieved how he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) affected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sight, so
that reappearance had, in him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>), each time, a virtue of its own--a kind of
disproportionate intensity suggesting his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) connection with occult sources
of renewal. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) do when he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) was away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that made him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>)
always come back only looking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have called it, <div class="bookquote">``more so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Superior to any shade of cabotinage, he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) yet almost resembled an actor
who, between his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) moments on the stage, revisits his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) dressing-room and,
before the glass, pressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) need of effect, retouches his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) make-up.
The Prince was at present, for instance, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had quitted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) but
ten minutes before, still more than then the person it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be
left with--a truth that had all its force for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) care for their conspicuous return together to the upper rooms.
Conspicuous beyond any wish they could entertain was what, poor
wonderful man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't help making it; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes
again, on the ascent, to Bob Assingham, still aloft in his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) gallery and
still looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was aware that, in spite of hovering and
warning inward voices, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) even enjoyed the testimony rendered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
lonely vigil to the lustre she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reflected.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was always lonely at great parties, the dear Colonel--it wasn't in
such places that the seed he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) sowed at home was ever reaped by him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); but
nobody could have seemed to mind it less, to brave it with more bronzed
indifference; so markedly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) moved about less like one of the
guests than like some quite presentable person in charge of the police
arrangements or the electric light. To Mrs. Verver, as will be seen,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) represented, with the perfect good faith of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) apparent blankness,
something definite enough; though her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) bravery was not thereby too
blighted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) to feel herself calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to witness that the only
witchcraft her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) companion had used, within the few minutes, was that of
attending Maggie, who had withdrawn from the scene, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) carriage.
Notified, at all events, of Fanny's probable presence, Charlotte was,
for a while after this, divided between the sense of it as a fact
somehow to reckon with and deal with, which was a perception that made,
in its degree, for the prudence, the pusillanimity of postponement, of
avoidance--and a quite other feeling, an impatience that presently ended
by prevailing, an eagerness, really, to BE suspected, sounded, veritably
arraigned, if only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might have the bad moment over, if only that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might prove to herself, let alone to Mrs. Assingham also, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
could convert it to good; if only, in short, to be <div class="bookquote">``square,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as they
said, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) question. For herself indeed, particularly, it wasn't a
question; but something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) bones told her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) that Fanny would treat it
as one, and there was truly nothing that, from this friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not
bound in decency to take. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might hand things back with every tender
precaution, with acknowledgments and assurances, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) owed it to
them, in any case, and it to all Mrs. Assingham had done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), not to
get rid of them without having well unwrapped and turned them over.

<p/>To-night, as happened--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) recognised it more and more, with the
ebbing minutes, as an influence of everything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)--to-night
exactly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) would, no doubt, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) knew why, be as firm as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
might at any near moment again hope to be for going through that process
with the right temper and tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said, after a little, to the Prince,
<div class="bookquote">``Stay with me; let no one take you; for I want her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), yes, I do want her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
to see us together, and the sooner the better'' (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>--said it to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) hand
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) through constant diversions, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), in fact, by saying
it, profess a momentary vagueness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) that it was
Fanny Assingham, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wanted to see--who clearly would be there, since
the Colonel never either stirred without her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) or, once arrived, concerned
himself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) fate; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had, further, after Amerigo had met
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) with <div class="bookquote">``See us together? why in the world? hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) often seen us
together?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div>to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) that what had elsewhere and otherwise happened
didn't now matter and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) at any rate well knew, for the occasion,
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was about. <div class="bookquote">``You're strange, cara mia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) consentingly enough
dropped; but, for whatever strangeness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), as they circulated,
from being waylaid, even remarking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) afresh as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had often done
before, on the help rendered, in such situations, by the intrinsic
oddity of the London <div class="bookquote">``squash,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>a thing of vague, slow, senseless eddies,
revolving as in fear of some menace of conversation suspended over it,
the drop of which, with some consequent refreshing splash or spatter,
yet never took place. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was strange; this, as they went,
Charlotte knew for herself: how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) be anything else when the
situation holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), for that matter, just as much,
had so the stamp of it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had already accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) consciousness, as
we have already noted, that a crisis, for them all, was in the air; and
when such hours were not depressing, which was the form indeed in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had mainly known them, they were apparently in a high degree
exhilarating.

<p/>Later on, in a corner to which, at sight of an empty sofa, Mrs.
Assingham had, after a single attentive arrest, led her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) with a certain
earnestness, this vision of the critical was much more sharpened than
blurred. Fanny had taken it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>): yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was there with Amerigo
alone, Maggie having come with them and then, within ten minutes,
changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind, repented and departed. <div class="bookquote">``So you're staying on together
without her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the elder woman had asked; and it was Charlotte's answer
to this that had determined for them, quite indeed according to the
latter's expectation, the need of some seclusion and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion's
pounce at the sofa. They were staying on together alone, and--oh
distinctly!--it was alone that Maggie had driven away, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, as
usual, not having managed to come. ```As usual'--?'' Mrs. Assingham had
seemed to wonder; Mr. Verver's reluctances not having, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) in fact quite
intimated, hitherto struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). Charlotte responded, at any rate, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) indisposition to go out had lately much increased--even though
to-night, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) admitted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had pleaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) not feeling well. Maggie
had wished to stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)--for the Prince and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), dining out, had
afterwards called in Portland Place, whence, in the event, they
had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), Charlotte, on. Maggie had come but to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had urged the two others to go without her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
yielded, for the time, to Mr. Verver's persuasion. But here, when they
had, after the long wait in the carriage, fairly got in; here, once up
the stairs, with the rooms before them, remorse had ended by seizing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had listened to no other remonstrance, and at present
therefore, as Charlotte put it, the two were doubtless making together
a little party at home. But it was all right--so Charlotte also put it:
there was nothing in the world they liked better than these snatched
felicities, little parties, long talks, with ``I'll come to you
to-morrow,'' and ``No, I'll come to you,'' make-believe renewals of their
old life. They were fairly, at times, the dear things, like children
playing at paying visits, playing at ``Mr. Thompson'' and <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Fane,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Thompson Fane each</b></font>)</div>each hoping that the other would really stay to tea. Charlotte was sure
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should find Maggie there on getting home--a remark in which Mrs.
Verver's immediate response to her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) friend's inquiry had culminated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
had thus, on the spot, the sense of having given her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) plenty to think
about, and that moreover of liking to see it even better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had
expected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had plenty to think about herself, and there was already
something in Fanny that made it seem still more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say your husband's ill? He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt too ill to come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear--I think not. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been too ill I wouldn't have left
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet Maggie was worried?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) worries, you know, easily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s afraid of influenza--of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has had, at different times, though never with the least gravity,
several attacks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're not afraid of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte had for a moment a pause; it had continued to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
that really to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) case <div class="bookquote">``out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>as they said, with the person in
the world to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) most intimate difficulties had oftenest referred
themselves, would help her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), on the whole, more than hinder; and under
that feeling all her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) opportunity, with nothing kept back; with a thing
or two perhaps even thrust forward, seemed temptingly to open. Besides,
didn't Fanny at bottom half expect, absolutely at the bottom half WANT,
things?--so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would be disappointed if, after what must just
have occurred for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) didn't get something to put between the teeth
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so restless rumination, that cultivation of the fear, of which
our young woman had already had glimpses, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have <div class="bookquote">``gone
too far''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) irrepressible interest in other lives. What had
just happened--it pieced itself together for Charlotte--was that the
Assingham pair, drifting like everyone else, had had somewhere in
the gallery, in the rooms, an accidental concussion; had it after the
Colonel, over his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) balustrade, had observed, in the favouring high
light, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) public junction with the Prince. His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) very dryness, in this
encounter, had, as always, struck a spark from his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife's curiosity,
and, familiar, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) side, with all that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw in things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as a fine little bone to pick, some report of the way one of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) young friends was <div class="bookquote">``going on''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>with another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew perfectly--such
at least was Charlotte's liberal assumption--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wasn't going on
with anyone, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) also knew that, given the circumstances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
inevitably to be sacrificed, in some form or another, to the humorous
intercourse of the inimitable couple. The Prince meanwhile had also,
under coercion, sacrificed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); the Ambassador had come up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) with
a message from Royalty, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) was led away; after which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
talked for five minutes with Sir John Brinder, who had been of the
Ambassador's company and who had rather artlessly remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).
Fanny had then arrived in sight of them at the same moment as someone
else she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) didn't know, someone who knew Mrs. Assingham and also knew Sir
John. Charlotte had left it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend's competence to throw the two
others immediately together and to find a way for entertaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in
closer quarters. This was the little history of the vision, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), that
was now rapidly helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to recognise a precious chance, the chance
that mightn't again soon be so good for the vivid making of a point. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
point was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); it was sharp, bright, true; above all it was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had reached it quite by herself; no one, not even
Amerigo--Amerigo least of all, who would have nothing to do with it--had
given her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) aid. To make it now with force for Fanny Assingham's benefit
would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) further, in the direction in which the light had dawned,
than any other spring she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) should, yet awhile, doubtless, be able to
press. The direction was that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) greater freedom--which was all in
the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had in mind. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) opportunity had accordingly, after a few
minutes of Mrs. Assingham's almost imprudently interested expression
of face, positively acquired such a price for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) may, for
ourselves, while the intensity lasted, rather resemble a person holding
out a small mirror at arm's length and consulting it with a special turn
of the head. It was, in a word, with this value of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) chance that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was intelligently playing when she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said in answer to Fanny's last
question: <div class="bookquote">``Don't you remember what you told me, on the occasion of
something or other, the other day? That you believe there's nothing I'm
afraid of? So, my dear, don't ask me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mayn't I ask you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham returned, <div class="bookquote">``how the case stands with
your poor husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, dear. Only, when you ask me as if I mightn't perhaps know
what to think, it seems to me best to let you see that I know perfectly
what to think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham hesitated; then, blinking a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) risk.
<div class="bookquote">``You didn't think that if it was a question of anyone's returning to
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) trouble, it would be better you yourself should have gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, Charlotte's answer to this inquiry visibly shaped itself in the
interest of the highest considerations. The highest considerations were
good humour, candour, clearness and, obviously, the REAL truth. <div class="bookquote">``If we
couldn't be perfectly frank and dear with each other, it would be ever
so much better, wouldn't it? that we shouldn't talk about anything at
all; which, however, would be dreadful--and we certainly, at any rate,
haven't yet come to it. You can ask me anything under the sun you like,
because, don't you see? you can't upset me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure, my dear Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny Assingham laughed, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to
upset you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, love, you simply COULDN'T even if you thought it
necessary--that's all I mean. Nobody could, for it belongs to my
situation that I'm, by no merit of my own, just fixed--fixed as fast as
a pin stuck, up to its head, in a cushion. I'm placed--I can't imagine
anyone MORE placed. There I AM!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny had indeed never listened to emphasis more firmly applied, and it
brought into her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) own eyes, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had reasons for striving to keep
them from betrayals, a sort of anxiety of intelligence. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say--but
your statement of your position, however you see it, isn't an answer to
my inquiry. It seems to me, at the same time, I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham
added, <div class="bookquote">``to give but the more reason for it. You speak of our being
`frank.' How can we possibly be anything else? If Maggie has gone off
through finding herself too distressed to stay, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s willing to
leave you and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband to show here without her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), aren't the grounds
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) preoccupation more or less discussable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If they're not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte replied, <div class="bookquote">``it's only from their being, in
a way, too evident. They're not grounds for me--they weren't when I
accepted Adam's preference that I should come to-night without him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>): just
as I accept, absolutely, as a fixed rule, ALL his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) preferences. But that
doesn't alter the fact, of course, that my husband's daughter, rather
than his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, should have felt SHE could, after all, be the one to
stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), the one to make the sacrifice of this hour--seeing,
especially, that the daughter has a husband of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own in the field.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>With which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) produced, as it were, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) explanation. <div class="bookquote">``I've simply to
see the truth of the matter--see that Maggie thinks more, on the whole,
of fathers than of husbands. And my situation is such,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on,
<div class="bookquote">``that this becomes immediately, don't you understand? a thing I have to
count with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham, vaguely heaving, panting a little but trying not to show
it, turned about, from some inward spring, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">``If you mean
such a thing as that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doesn't adore the Prince--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doesn't adore him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). What I say is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doesn't think
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). One of those conditions doesn't always, at all stages, involve
the other. This is just HOW she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) adores him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>Charlotte said. <div class="bookquote">``And what
reason is there, in the world, after all, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) and I shouldn't, as
you say, show together? We've shown together, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smiled,
<div class="bookquote">``before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend, for a little, only looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--speaking then with
abruptness. <div class="bookquote">``You ought to be absolutely happy. You live with such GOOD
people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>The effect of it, as well, was an arrest for Charlotte; whose face,
however, all of whose fine and slightly hard radiance, it had caused,
the next instant, further to brighten. <div class="bookquote">``Does one ever put into words
anything so fatuously rash? It's a thing that must be said, in prudence,
FOR one--by somebody who's so good as to take the responsibility: the
more that it gives one always a chance to show one's best manners by
not contradicting it. Certainly, you'll never have the distress, or
whatever, of hearing me complain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, my dear, I hope in all conscience not!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>and the elder woman's
spirit found relief in a laugh more resonant than was quite advised by
their pursuit of privacy.

<p/>To this demonstration her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friend gave no heed. <div class="bookquote">``With all our absence
after marriage, and with the separation from her (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) produced in particular
by our so many months in America, Maggie has still arrears, still losses
to make up--still the need of showing how, for so long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) simply kept
missing him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) company--a large allowance of which is, in
spite of everything else, of the first necessity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) puts it
in when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) can--a little here, a little there, and it ends by making up
a considerable amount. The fact of our distinct establishments--which
has, all the same, everything in its favour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte hastened to
declare, <div class="bookquote">``makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) really see more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) than when they had the same
house. To make sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doesn't fail of it she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s always arranging for
it--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't have to do while they lived together. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) likes
to arrange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte steadily proceeded; <div class="bookquote">``it peculiarly suits her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); and
the result of our separate households is really, for them, more contact
and more intimacy. To-night, for instance, has been practically an
arrangement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) likes him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) best alone. And it's the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said our young
woman, <div class="bookquote">``in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) best likes HER. It's what I mean therefore by being
`placed.' And the great thing is, as they say, to `know' one's place.
Doesn't it all strike you,''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``as rather placing the Prince
too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny Assingham had at this moment the sense as of a large heaped dish
presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) intelligence and inviting it to a feast--so thick were
the notes of intention in this remarkable speech. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) also felt that
to plunge at random, to help herself too freely, would--apart from there
not being at such a moment time for it--tend to jostle the ministering
hand, confound the array and, more vulgarly speaking, make a mess. So
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) picked out, after consideration, a solitary plum. <div class="bookquote">``So placed that
YOU have to arrange?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I have to arrange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the Prince also--if the effect for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is the same?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, I think, not less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And does he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) arrange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham asked, <div class="bookquote">``to make up HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) arrears?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>The question had risen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) lips--it was as if another morsel, on the
dish, had tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). The sound of it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) own ear, immediately,
as giving out more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) thought than she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had as yet intended; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
quickly saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) must follow it up, at any risk, with simplicity,
and that what was simplest was the ease of boldness. <div class="bookquote">``Make them up, I
mean, by coming to see YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte replied, however, without, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend would have phrased
it, turning a hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) head, but it was beautifully gentle.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) never comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham: with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt a little stupid. <div class="bookquote">``There
it is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might so well, you know, otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Otherwise'?''--and Fanny was still vague.

<p/>It passed, this time, over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) companion, whose eyes, wandering, to
a distance, found themselves held. The Prince was at hand again; the
Ambassador was still at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) side; they were stopped a moment by a
uniformed personage, a little old man, of apparently the highest
military character, bristling with medals and orders. This gave
Charlotte time to go on. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) has not been for three months.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>And then as
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend's last word in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ear: ```Otherwise'--yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arranges
otherwise. And in my position,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I might too. It's too absurd
we shouldn't meet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've met, I gather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--as far as that goes. But what I mean is that I might--placed for
it as we both are--go to see HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny asked with almost mistaken solemnity.

<p/>The perception of this excess made Charlotte, whether for gravity or for
irony, hang fire a minute. <div class="bookquote">``I HAVE been. But that's nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``in itself, and I tell you of it only to show you how our situation
works. It essentially becomes one, a situation, for both of us. The
Prince's, however, is his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own affair--I meant but to speak of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your situation's perfect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham presently declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say it isn't. Taken, in fact, all round, I think it is. And I
don't, as I tell you, complain of it. The only thing is that I have to
act as it demands of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To `act'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham with an irrepressible quaver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it acting, my dear, to accept it? I do accept it. What do you
want me to do less?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to believe that you're a very fortunate person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you call that LESS?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte asked with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``From the point
of view of my freedom I call it more. Let it take, my position, any name
you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let it, at any rate'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>--and Mrs. Assingham's impatience prevailed
at last over her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) presence of mind--<div class="bookquote">``don't let it make you think too much
of your freedom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you call too much--for how can I not see it as it
is? You'd see your own quickly enough if the Colonel gave you the same
liberty--and I haven't to tell you, with your so much greater knowledge
of everything, what it is that gives such liberty most. For yourself
personally of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte went on, <div class="bookquote">``you only know the state of
neither needing it nor missing it. Your husband doesn't treat you as of
less importance to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) than some other woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, don't talk to me of other women!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny now overtly panted. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
call Mr. Verver's perfectly natural interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The greatest affection of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) is capable?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte took it up
in all readiness. <div class="bookquote">``I do distinctly--and in spite of my having done all I
could think of--to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) capable of a greater. I've done, earnestly,
everything I could--I've made it, month after month, my study. But I
haven't succeeded--it has been vividly brought home to me to-night.
However,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``I've hoped against hope, for I recognise that,
as I told you at the time, I was duly warned.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) met in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend's face the absence of any such remembrance: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) did tell me
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wanted me just BECAUSE I could be useful about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>With which
Charlotte broke into a wonderful smile. <div class="bookquote">``So you see I AM!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>It was on Fanny Assingham's lips for the moment to reply that this was,
on the contrary, exactly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) didn't see; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) came in fact within an
ace of saying: <div class="bookquote">``You strike me as having quite failed to help his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) idea to
work--since, by your account, Maggie has him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) not less, but so much more,
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind. How in the world, with so much of a remedy, comes there
to remain so much of what was to be obviated?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) saved herself
in time, conscious above all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was in presence of still deeper
things than she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had yet dared to fear, that there was <div class="bookquote">``more in it''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>than any admission she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had made represented--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had held herself
familiar with admissions: so that, not to seem to understand where she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
couldn't accept, and not to seem to accept where she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) couldn't approve,
and could still less, with precipitation, advise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) invoked the mere
appearance of casting no weight whatever into the scales of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) young
friend's consistency. The only thing was that, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was quickly
enough to feel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) invoked it rather to excess. It brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
invocation, too abruptly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) brushed away everything. <div class="bookquote">``I
can't conceive, my dear, what you're talking about!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte promptly rose then, as might be, to meet it, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) colour,
for the first time, perceptibly heightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looked, for the minute,
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion had looked--as if twenty protests, blocking each
other's way, had surged up within her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). But when Charlotte had to make a
selection, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) selection was always the most effective possible. It was
happy now, above all, for being made not in anger but in sorrow. <div class="bookquote">``You
give me up then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give you up--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You forsake me at the hour of my life when it seems to me I most
deserve a friend's loyalty? If you do you're not just, Fanny; you're
even, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``rather cruel; and it's least of all
worthy of you to seem to wish to quarrel with me in order to cover your
desertion.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spoke, at the same time, with the noblest moderation of
tone, and the image of high, pale, lighted disappointment she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) meanwhile
presented, as of a creature patient and lonely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) splendour, was an
impression so firmly imposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) measure to the
brim and yet enjoy the last word, as it is called in such cases, with a
perfection void of any vulgarity of triumph. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) merely completed,
for truth's sake, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) demonstration. <div class="bookquote">``What is a quarrel with me but a
quarrel with my right to recognise the conditions of my bargain? But I
can carry them out alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) turned away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) turned
to meet the Ambassador and the Prince, who, their colloquy with their
Field-Marshal ended, were now at hand and had already, between them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
was aware, addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a remark that failed to penetrate the golden
glow in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) intelligence was temporarily bathed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) point, the point she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had foreseen she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must make; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had made it
thoroughly and once for all, so that no more making was required; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) success was reflected in the faces of the two men of distinction
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), unmistakably moved to admiration by her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) exceptional
radiance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) at first but watched this reflection, taking no note of
any less adequate form of it possibly presented by poor Fanny--poor
Fanny left to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) incurred <div class="bookquote">``score,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>chalked up in so few
strokes on the wall; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) took in what the Ambassador was saying, in
French, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) was apparently repeating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A desire for your presence, Madame, has been expressed en tres-haut
lieu, and I've let myself in for the responsibility, to say nothing of
the honour, of seeing, as the most respectful of your friends, that
so august an impatience is not kept waiting.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Personage</b></font>)</div>The greatest possible
Personage had, in short, according to the odd formula of societies
subject to the greatest personages possible, <div class="bookquote">``sent for''  (<font color='red'><b>the personages</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
asked, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) surprise, <div class="bookquote">``What in the world does he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) want to do to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>only to know, without looking, that Fanny's bewilderment was called to
a still larger application, and to hear the Prince say with authority,
indeed with a certain prompt dryness: <div class="bookquote">``You must go immediately--it's a
summons.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>The Ambassador, using authority as well, had already somehow
possessed himself of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) drew into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) arm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
further conscious as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went off with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) that, though still speaking
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) benefit, Amerigo had turned to Fanny Assingham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) would explain
afterwards--besides which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) would understand for herself. To
Fanny, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) had laughed--as a mark, apparently, that for this
infallible friend no explanation at all would be necessary.




<p/>XV

<p/>It may be recorded none the less that the Prince was the next moment to
see how little any such assumption was founded. Alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) now Mrs.
Assingham was incorruptible. <div class="bookquote">``They send for Charlotte through YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear; as you see, through the Ambassador.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but the Ambassador and you, for the last quarter-of-an-hour, have
been for them as one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>)'s YOUR ambassador.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Fanny</b></font>)</div>It may indeed be further
mentioned that the more Fanny looked at it the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw in it.
<div class="bookquote">``They've connected her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) with you--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s treated as your appendage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh, my `appendage,''' the Prince amusedly exclaimed--<div class="bookquote">``cara mia, what a
name! She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s treated, rather, say, as my ornament and my glory. And it's
so remarkable a case for a mother-in-law that you surely can't find
fault with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've ornaments enough, it seems to me--as you've certainly glories
enough--without her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>)'s not the least little bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham
observed, <div class="bookquote">``your mother-in-law. In such a matter a shade of difference is
enormous. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>)'s no relation to you whatever, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>)'s known in
high quarters but as going about with you, then--then--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) failed,
however, as from positive intensity of vision. <div class="bookquote">``Then, then what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
asked with perfect good-nature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) had better in such a case not be known at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I assure you I never, just now, so much as mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>). Do you
suppose I asked them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, still amused, <div class="bookquote">``if they didn't
want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>)? You surely don't need to be shown that Charlotte speaks
for herself--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) does so above all on such an occasion as this and
looking as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) does to-night. How, so looking, can she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pass unnoticed?
How can she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) not have `success'? Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) but watched
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, letting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wanted to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would say it, <div class="bookquote">``besides, there IS always the fact that we're of the same
connection, of--what is your word?--the same `concern.' We're
certainly not, with the relation of our respective sposi, simply formal
acquaintances. We're in the same boat'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and the Prince smiled with a
candour that added an accent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) emphasis.

<p/>Fanny Assingham was full of the special sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) manner: it
caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) to turn for a moment's refuge to a corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) general
consciousness in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could say to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was glad SHE
wasn't in love with such a man. As with Charlotte just before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
embarrassed by the difference between what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) took in and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
could say, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could show. <div class="bookquote">``It only appears to
me of great importance that--now that you all seem more settled
here--Charlotte should be known, for any presentation, any further
circulation or introduction, as, in particular, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's wife;
known in the least possible degree as anything else. I don't know what
you mean by the `same' boat. Charlotte is naturally in Mr. Verver's
boat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, pray, am _I_ not in Mr. Verver's boat too? Why, but for Mr.
Verver's boat, I should have been by this time'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quick Italian
gesture, an expressive direction and motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forefinger, pointed
to deepest depths--<div class="bookquote">``away down, down, down.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew of course what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
meant--how it had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father-in-law's great fortune, and taken no
small slice, to surround him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with an element in which, all too fatally
weighted as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had originally been, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could pecuniarily float; and with
this reminder other things came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--how strange it was that, with
all allowance for their merit, it should befall some people to be so
inordinately valued, quoted, as they said in the stock-market, so high,
and how still stranger, perhaps, that there should be cases in which,
for some reason, one didn't mind the so frequently marked absence in
them of the purpose really to represent their price. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was thinking,
feeling, at any rate, for herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was thinking that the pleasure
SHE could take in this specimen of the class didn't suffer from his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
consent to be merely made buoyant: partly because it was one of those
pleasures -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) inspired them-RRB- that, by their nature, COULDN'T suffer, to
whatever proof they were put; and partly because, besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) after all
visibly had on his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) conscience some sort of return for services
rendered. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was a huge expense assuredly--but it had been up to now her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) idea was to behave beautifully enough to make the
beauty well nigh an equivalent. And that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had carried out his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) idea,
carried it out by continuing to lead the life, to breathe the air, very
nearly to think the thoughts, that best suited his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father--
this she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had till lately enjoyed the comfort of so distinctly perceiving
as to have even been moved more than once, to express to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) the
happiness it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had that in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) favour as against other
matters; yet it discouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) too, and rather oddly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) should so
keep moving, and be able to show her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) moved, on the firm ground
of the truth. His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) acknowledgment of obligation was far from unimportant,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could find in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) grasp of the real itself a kind of ominous
intimation. The intimation appeared to peep at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) even out of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) next
word, lightly as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) produced it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it rather as if we had, Charlotte and I, for bringing
us together, a benefactor in common?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the effect, for his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
interlocutress, was still further to be deepened. <div class="bookquote">``I somehow feel, half
the time, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) were her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father-in-law too. It's as if he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) had saved
us both--which is a fact in our lives, or at any rate in our hearts, to
make of itself a link. Don't you remember'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) kept it up--<div class="bookquote">``how, the day
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) suddenly turned up for you, just before my wedding, we so frankly
and funnily talked, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) presence, of the advisability, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), of
some good marriage?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then as his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) friend's face, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) extremity,
quite again as with Charlotte, but continued to fly the black flag of
general repudiation: <div class="bookquote">``Well, we really began then, as it seems to me, the
work of placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is. We were wholly right--and so was she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).
That it was exactly the thing is shown by its success. We recommended
a good marriage at almost any price, so to speak, and, taking us at our
word, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has made the very best. That was really what we meant, wasn't
it? Only--what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has got--something thoroughly good. It would be
difficult, it seems to me, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to have anything better--once you
allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) the way it's to be taken. Of course if you don't allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
that the case is different. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) offset is a certain decent freedom--
which, I judge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'ll be quite contented with. You may say that will be
very good of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) strikes me as perfectly humble about it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) proposes neither to claim it nor to use it with any sort of
retentissement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would enjoy it, I think, quite as quietly as it
might be given. The `boat,' you see'' (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>--the Prince explained it no less
considerately and lucidly--<div class="bookquote">``is a good deal tied up at the dock, or
anchored, if you like, out in the stream. I have to jump out from time
to time to stretch my legs, and you'll probably perceive, if you give it
your attention, that Charlotte really can't help occasionally doing
the same. It isn't even a question, sometimes, of one's getting to the
dock--one has to take a header and splash about in the water. Call our
having remained here together to-night, call the accident of my
having put them, put our illustrious friends there, on my
companion's track--for I grant you this as a practical result of our
combination--call the whole thing one of the harmless little plunges off
the deck, inevitable for each of us. Why not take them, when they occur,
as inevitable--and, above all, as not endangering life or limb? We
shan't drown, we shan't sink--at least I can answer for myself. Mrs.
Verver too, moreover--do her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) the justice--visibly knows how to swim.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could easily go on, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); Fanny felt now that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wouldn't have interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) for the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eloquence
precious; there was not a drop of it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) didn't, in a manner,
catch, as it came, for immediate bottling, for future preservation. The
crystal flask of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) innermost attention really received it on the spot,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had even already the vision of how, in the snug laboratory of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) afterthought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should be able chemically to analyse it. There
were moments, positively, still beyond this, when, with the meeting of
their eyes, something as yet unnamable came out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) look,
when something strange and subtle and at variance with his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) words,
something that GAVE THEM AWAY, glimmered deep down, as an appeal, almost
an incredible one, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) finer comprehension. What, inconceivably,
was it like? Wasn't it, however gross, such a rendering of anything so
occult, fairly like a quintessential wink, a hint of the possibility
of their REALLY treating their subject--of course on some better
occasion--and thereby, as well, finding it much more interesting? If
this far red spark, which might have been figured by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind as the
head-light of an approaching train seen through the length of a tunnel,
was not, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) side, an ignis fatuus, a mere subjective phenomenon, it
twinkled there at the direct expense of what the Prince was inviting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to understand. Meanwhile too, however, and unmistakably, the real
treatment of their subject did, at a given moment, sound. This was when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) proceeded, with just the same perfect possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) thought--on
the manner of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) couldn't have improved--to complete his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
successful simile by another, in fact by just the supreme touch, the
touch for which it had till now been waiting. <div class="bookquote">``For Mrs. Verver to be
known to people so intensely and exclusively as her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) husband's wife,
something is wanted that, you know, they haven't exactly got. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should
manage to be known--or at least to be seen--a little more as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's
husband. You surely must by this time have seen for yourself that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own habits and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own ways, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) makes, more and more--as
of course he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has a perfect right to do--his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own discriminations. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s so
perfect, so ideal a father, and, doubtless largely by that very fact,
a generous, a comfortable, an admirable father-in-law, that I should
really feel it base to avail myself of any standpoint whatever to
criticise him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>). To YOU, nevertheless, I may make just one remark; for
you're not stupid--you always understand so blessedly what one means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) paused an instant, as if even this one remark might be difficult for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) should she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) give no sign of encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to produce it. Nothing
would have induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), however, to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was now conscious
of having never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life stood so still or sat, inwardly, as it were,
so tight; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt like the horse of the adage, brought--and brought by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own fault--to the water, but strong, for the occasion, in the one
fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) couldn't be forced to drink. Invited, in other words, to
understand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) breath for fear of showing she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did, and this
for the excellent reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was at last fairly afraid to. It was
sharp for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), at the same time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was certain, in advance, of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) remark; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heard it before it had sounded, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
already tasted, in fine, the bitterness it would have for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) special
sensibility. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) companion, from an inward and different need of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
own, was presently not deterred by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) silence. <div class="bookquote">``What I really don't see
is why, from his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) own point of view--given, that is, his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) conditions, so
fortunate as they stood--he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) should have wished to marry at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There
it was then--exactly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew would come, and exactly, for reasons
that seemed now to thump at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart, as distressing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was resolved, meanwhile, not to suffer, as they used to say of the
martyrs, then and there; not to suffer, odiously, helplessly, in
public--which could be prevented but by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) breaking off, with whatever
inconsequence; by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) treating their discussion as ended and getting
away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) suddenly wanted to go home much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had wanted, an hour
or two before, to come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanted to leave well behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) both her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
question and the couple in whom it had, abruptly, taken such vivid
form--but it was dreadful to have the appearance of disconcerted flight.
Discussion had of itself, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sense, become danger--such light, as
from open crevices, it let in; and the overt recognition of danger was
worse than anything else. The worst in fact came while she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was thinking
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could retreat and still not overtly recognise. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face had
betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) trouble, and with that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was lost. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid, however,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince said, <div class="bookquote">``that I, for some reason, distress you--for which I beg
your pardon. We've always talked so well together--it has been, from
the beginning, the greatest pull for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>Nothing so much as such a tone
could have quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) collapse; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now at his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) mercy,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) showed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) went on, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew it. <div class="bookquote">``We shall talk again, all
the same, better than ever--I depend on it too much. Don't you remember
what I told you, so definitely, one day before my marriage?--that,
moving as I did in so many ways among new things, mysteries, conditions,
expectations, assumptions different from any I had known, I looked to
you, as my original sponsor, my fairy godmother, to see me through. I
beg you to believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that I look to you yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) very insistence had, fortunately, the next moment, affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as
bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) help; with which, at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could hold up her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head to
speak. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you ARE through--you were through long ago. Or if you aren't
you ought to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, if I ought to be it's all the more reason why you should
continue to help me. Because, very distinctly, I assure you, I'm not.
The new things or ever so many of them--are still for me new things;
the mysteries and expectations and assumptions still contain an immense
element that I've failed to puzzle out. As we've happened, so luckily,
to find ourselves again really taking hold together, you must let me, as
soon as possible, come to see you; you must give me a good, kind
hour. If you refuse it me'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) addressed himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) continued
reserve--<div class="bookquote">``I shall feel that you deny, with a stony stare, your
responsibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At this, as from a sudden shake, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reserve proved an inadequate
vessel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) private reference to the weight on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind, but the touch of another hand made it too horribly press. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
I deny responsibility--to YOU. So far as I ever had it I've done with
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had been, all the while, beautifully smiling; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) look,
now, penetrate her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) again more. <div class="bookquote">``As to whom then do you confess it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, mio caro, that's--if to anyone--my own business!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) continued to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hard. <div class="bookquote">``You give me up then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>It was what Charlotte had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ten minutes before, and its coming
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) so much in the same way shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was on the
point of replying <div class="bookquote">``Do you and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) agree together for what you'll say
to me?'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was glad afterwards to have checked herself in time,
little as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) actual answer had perhaps bettered it. <div class="bookquote">``I think I don't
know what to make of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must receive me at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, not till I'm ready for you!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) found a laugh
for it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had to turn away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had never turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) before,
and it was quite positively for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) were altogether afraid of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).



<p/>XVI

<p/>Later on, when their hired brougham had, with the long vociferation that
tormented her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) impatience, been extricated from the endless rank, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
rolled into the London night, beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband, as into a sheltering
darkness where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could muffle herself and draw breath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had stood
for the previous half-hour in a merciless glare, beaten upon, stared out
of countenance, it fairly seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), by intimations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mistake.
For what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was most immediately feeling was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had, in the past,
been active, for these people, to ends that were now bearing fruit and
that might yet bear a larger crop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) but brooded, at first, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
corner of the carriage: it was like burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) exposed face, a face too
helplessly exposed, in the cool lap of the common indifference, of the
dispeopled streets, of the closed shops and darkened houses seen
through the window of the brougham, a world mercifully unconscious
and unreproachful. It wouldn't, like the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had just left, know
sooner or later what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had done, or would know it, at least, only if
the final consequence should be some quite overwhelming publicity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
fixed this possibility itself so hard, however, for a few moments, that
the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fear produced the next minute a reaction; and when the
carriage happened, while it grazed a turn, to catch the straight shaft
from the lamp of a policeman in the act of playing his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) inquisitive
flash over an opposite house-front, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) let herself wince at being thus
incriminated only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might protest, not less quickly, against
mere blind terror. It had become, for the occasion, preposterously,
terror--of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must shake herself free before she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could properly
measure her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ground. The perception of this necessity had in truth soon
aided her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); since she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) found, on trying, that, lurid as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) prospect
might hover there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could none the less give it no name. The sense of
seeing was strong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) clutched at the comfort of not being
sure of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) saw. Not to know what it would represent on a longer
view was a help, in turn, to not making out that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hands were embrued;
since if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had stood in the position of a producing cause she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should
surely be less vague about what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had produced. This, further, in its
way, was a step toward reflecting that when one's connection with any
matter was too indirect to be traced it might be described also as too
slight to be deplored. By the time they were nearing Cadogan Place she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had in fact recognised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't be as curious as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) desired
without arriving at some conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) being as innocent. But there
had been a moment, in the dim desert of Eaton Square, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) broke
into speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only their defending themselves so much more than they need--it's
only THAT that makes me wonder. It's their having so remarkably much to
say for themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband had, as usual, lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cigar, remaining apparently as
busy with it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) agitation. <div class="bookquote">``You mean it makes you feel that
you have nothing?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>To which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) made no answer, the Colonel added:
<div class="bookquote">``What in the world did you ever suppose was going to happen? The man's
in a position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has nothing in life to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) silence seemed to characterise this statement as superficial, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thoughts, as always in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's company, pursued an independent
course. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), when they were together, talk, but as if for
some other person; who was in fact for the most part herself. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
addressed herself with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could never have done without him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has behaved beautifully--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did from the first. I've thought it,
all along, wonderful of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and I've more than once, when I've had a
chance, told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so. Therefore, therefore--!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But it died away as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
mused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a right, for a change, to kick up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heels?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't a question, of course, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) undivertedly went on, <div class="bookquote">``of
their behaving beautifully apart. It's a question of their doing as they
should when together--which is another matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you think then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel asked with interest, <div class="bookquote">``that,
when together, they SHOULD do? The less they do, one would say, the
better--if you see so much in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife, at this, appeared to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't see in it what YOU'D
see. And don't, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) further answered, <div class="bookquote">``think it necessary to
be horrid or low about them. They're the last people, really, to make
anything of that sort come in right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm surely never horrid or low,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``about anyone but my
extravagant wife. I can do with all our friends--as I see them myself:
what I can't do with is the figures you make of them. And when you take
to adding your figures up--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) exhaled it again in smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My additions don't matter when you've not to pay the bill.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With which
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) meditation again bore her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) through the air. <div class="bookquote">``The great thing was that
when it so suddenly came up for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) wasn't afraid. If he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) had been
afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) could perfectly have prevented it. And if I had seen he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>)
was--if I hadn't seen he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) wasn't--so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``could I.
So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) declared, <div class="bookquote">``WOULD I. It's perfectly true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) went on--<div class="bookquote">``it was
too good a thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), such a chance in life, not to be accepted.
And I LIKED his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) not keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) out of it merely from a fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) own
nature. It was so wonderful it should come to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). The only thing would
have been if Charlotte herself couldn't have faced it. Then, if SHE had
not had confidence, we might have talked. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had it to any amount.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) how much?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div>Bob Assingham patiently inquired.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had put the question with no more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) usual modest hope of
reward, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had pressed, this time, the sharpest spring of response.
<div class="bookquote">``Never, never--it wasn't a time to `ask.' Asking is suggesting--and it
wasn't a time to suggest. One had to make up one's mind, as quietly as
possible, by what one could judge. And I judge, as I say, that Charlotte
felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could face it. For which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) struck me at the time as--for so
proud a creature--almost touchingly grateful. The thing I should never
forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) forgetting to whom it is her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thanks have
remained most due.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is to Mrs. Assingham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said nothing for a little--there were, after all, alternatives.
<div class="bookquote">``Maggie herself of course--astonishing little Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Maggie then astonishing too?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) gloomed out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) window.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wife, on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side now, as they rolled, projected the same look. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
not sure that I don't begin to see more in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) than--dear little person
as I've always thought--I ever supposed there was. I'm not sure that,
putting a good many things together, I'm not beginning to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) out
rather extraordinary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You certainly will if you can,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel resignedly remarked.

<p/>Again his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) companion said nothing; then again she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) broke out. <div class="bookquote">``In fact--I
do begin to feel it--Maggie's the great comfort. I'm getting hold of it.
It will be SHE who'll see us through. In fact she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll have to. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll
be able.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Touch by touch her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) meditation had completed it, but with a cumulative
effect for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's general sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) method that caused him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
to overflow, whimsically enough, in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) corner, into an ejaculation now
frequent on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips for the relief that, especially in communion like
the present, it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and that Fanny had critically traced to the
quaint example, the aboriginal homeliness, still so delightful, of Mr.
Verver. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lordy, Lordy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham continued, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll be extraordinary
enough--and that's what I'm thinking of. But I'm not indeed so very
sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``of the person to whom Charlotte ought in decency to
be most grateful. I mean I'm not sure if that person is even almost the
incredible little idealist who has made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>idealist</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't think you would be, love,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel with some promptness
responded. <div class="bookquote">``Charlotte as the wife of an incredible little idealist--!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) cigar, in short, once more, could alone express it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet what is that, when one thinks, but just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) struck one as
more or less persuaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) herself was really going to be?'' (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>--this
memory, for the full view, Fanny found herself also invoking.

<p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) companion, in truth, slightly gape. <div class="bookquote">``An incredible little
idealist--Charlotte herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was sincere,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) wife simply proceeded <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was unmistakably
sincere. The question is only how much is left of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that--I see--happens to be another of the questions you can't ask
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). You have to do it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div>said Bob Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``as if you were playing
some game with its rules drawn up--though who's to come down on you
if you break them I don't quite see. Or must you do it in three
guesses--like forfeits on Christmas eve?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div>To which, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) ribaldry but
dropped from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) further added: <div class="bookquote">``How much of anything will have to
be left for you to be able to go on with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny Assingham a trifle grimly declared, <div class="bookquote">``while
there's a scrap as big as your nail. But we're not yet, luckily, reduced
only to that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had another pause, holding the while the thread of
that larger perception into which her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) view of Mrs. Verver's obligation
to Maggie had suddenly expanded. <div class="bookquote">``Even if her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) debt was not to the
others--even then it ought to be quite sufficiently to the Prince
himself to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) straight. For what, really, did the Prince do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
asked herself, <div class="bookquote">``but generously trust her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) do but take
it from her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) that if she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) felt herself willing it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) felt
herself strong? That creates for her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham
pursued, <div class="bookquote">``a duty of considering him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), of honourably repaying his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) trust,
which--well, which she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)'ll be really a fiend if she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) doesn't make the law
of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) conduct. I mean of course his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) trust that she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) wouldn't interfere
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--expressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) holding himself quiet at the critical time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>The brougham was nearing home, and it was perhaps this sense of ebbing
opportunity that caused the Colonel's next meditation to flower in a
fashion almost surprising to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife. They were united, for the most
part, but by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) exhausted patience; so that indulgent despair was
generally, at the best, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) note. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) at present, however, actually
compromised with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) despair to the extent of practically admitting that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) steps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) literally asked, in short, an intelligent,
well nigh a sympathising, question. <div class="bookquote">``Gratitude to the Prince for not
having put a spoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) wheel--that, you mean, should, taking it in
the right way, be precisely the ballast of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) boat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Taking it in the right way.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny, catching at this gleam, emphasised
the proviso.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But doesn't it rather depend on what she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) may most feel to BE the right
way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--it depends on nothing. Because there's only one way--for duty or
delicacy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--delicacy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div>Bob Assingham rather crudely murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean the highest kind--moral. Charlotte's perfectly capable of
appreciating that. By every dictate of moral delicacy she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must let him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)
alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you've made up your mind it's all poor Charlotte?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) asked with
an effect of abruptness.

<p/>The effect, whether intended or not, reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)--brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face short
round. It was a touch at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) again lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) balance, at which,
somehow, the bottom dropped out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) recovered comfort. <div class="bookquote">``Then
you've made up yours differently? It really struck you that there IS
something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The movement itself, apparently, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) once more stand off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
had felt on his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) nearer approach the high temperature of the question.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps that's just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s doing: showing him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s
letting him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) alone--pointing it out to him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) from day to day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) point it out by waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) to-night on the stair-case in
the manner you described to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really, my dear, described to you a manner?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel, clearly,
from want of habit, scarce recognised himself in the imputation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--for once in a way; in those few words we had after you had watched
them come up you told me something of what you had seen. You didn't
tell me very much--THAT you couldn't for your life; but I saw for myself
that, strange to say, you had received your impression, and I felt
therefore that there must indeed have been something out of the way for
you so to betray it.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was fully upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) proved sensibility to the occasion--confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) because of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own uneasy need to profit by it. It came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) still more than at
the time, it came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had been struck with something, even
HE (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), poor dear man; and that for this to have occurred there must have
been much to be struck with. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tried in fact to corner him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), to
pack him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) insistently down, in the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) plain vision, the very
plainness of which was its value; for so recorded, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt, none of
it would escape--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should have it at hand for reference. <div class="bookquote">``Come, my
dear--you thought what you thought: in the presence of what you saw you
couldn't resist thinking. I don't ask more of it than that. And your
idea is worth, this time, quite as much as any of mine--so that you
can't pretend, as usual, that mine has run away with me. I haven't
caught up with you. I stay where I am. But I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) concluded, <div class="bookquote">``where
you are, and I'm much obliged to you for letting me. You give me a point
de repere outside myself--which is where I like it. Now I can work round
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Their conveyance, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke, stopped at their door, and it was, on
the spot, another fact of value for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) husband, though seated
on the side by which they must alight, made no movement. They were in a
high degree votaries of the latch-key, so that their household had gone
to bed; and as they were unaccompanied by a footman the coachman
waited in peace. It was so indeed that for a minute Bob Assingham
waited--conscious of a reason for replying to this address otherwise
than by the so obvious method of turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) didn't turn
his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) face, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) stared straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wife had already
perceived in the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) not moving all the proof she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could desire--
proof, that is, of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own contention. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) never cared what
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) neglect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) chance to show it was thereby the more
eloquent. <div class="bookquote">``Leave it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) at last remarked, <div class="bookquote">``to THEM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>```Leave' it--?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wondered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let them alone. They'll manage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll manage, you mean, to do everything they want? Ah, there then
you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll manage in their own way,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel almost cryptically
repeated.

<p/>It had its effect for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>): quite apart from its light on the familiar
phenomenon of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's indurated conscience, it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), full in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face, the particular evocation of which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) guilty.
It was wonderful truly, then, the evocation. <div class="bookquote">``So cleverly--THAT'S your
idea?--that no one will be the wiser? It's your idea that we shall have
done all that's required of us if we simply protect them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel, still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) place, declined, however, to be drawn into a
statement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) idea. Statements were too much like theories, in
which one lost one's way; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) only knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said
represented the limited vibration of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) confirmed old toughness
had been capable. Still, none the less, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) point to make--for
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) took another instant. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) made it, for the third time, in
the same fashion. <div class="bookquote">``They'll manage in their own way.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) got
out.

<p/>Oh yes, at this, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) companion, it had indeed its effect, and while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) mounted their steps she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) but stared, without following him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
opening of their door. Their hall was lighted, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) stood in the
aperture looking back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) tall lean figure outlined in darkness
and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) crush-hat, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wont, worn cavalierly, rather
diabolically, askew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) seemed to prolong the sinister emphasis of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
meaning. In general, on these returns, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) came back for her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had
prepared their entrance; so that it was now as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) were ashamed to
face her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) in closer quarters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) across the interval,
and, still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) seat, weighing his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) charge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) whole view
of everything flare up. Wasn't it simply what had been written in the
Prince's own face BENEATH what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was saying?--didn't it correspond with
the mocking presence there that she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) troubled glimpse of?
Wasn't, in fine, the pledge that they would <div class="bookquote">``manage in their own way''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had been feeling for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) chance to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to take from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) husband's tone somehow fitted Amerigo's look--the one that had,
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), so strangely, peeped, from behind, over the shoulder of the one
in front. She (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had not then read it--but wasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) reading it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
now saw in it his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) surmise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was perhaps to be squared? She (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wasn't
to be squared, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) companion call across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``Well, what's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) also took time to remind herself that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had decided she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) couldn't be frightened. The <div class="bookquote">``matter'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>?--why, it was
sufficiently the matter, with all this, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) felt a little sick. For
it was not the Prince that she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had been prepared to regard as primarily
the shaky one. Shakiness in Charlotte she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had, at the most, perhaps
postulated--it would be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) somehow felt, more easy to deal with.
Therefore if HE (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had come so far it was a different pair of sleeves.
There was nothing to choose between them. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) so helpless that,
as the time passed without her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) alighting, the Colonel came back
and fairly drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) forth; after which, on the pavement, under the
street-lamp, their very silence might have been the mark of something
grave--their silence eked out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) arm and
their then crawling up their steps quite mildly and unitedly together,
like some old Darby and Joan who have had a disappointment. It almost
resembled a return from a funeral--unless indeed it resembled more the
hushed approach to a house of mourning. What indeed had she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) come home
for but to bury, as decently as possible, her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) mistake?



<p/>XVII

<p/>It appeared thus that they might enjoy together extraordinary freedom,
the two friends, from the moment they should understand their position
aright. With the Prince himself, from an early stage, not unnaturally,
Charlotte had made a great point of their so understanding it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
found frequent occasion to describe to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) this necessity, and, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
resignation tempered, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) intelligence at least quickened, by
irrepressible irony, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) applied at different times different names to
the propriety of their case. The wonderful thing was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sense of
propriety had been, from the first, especially alive about it. There
were hours when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spoke of their taking refuge in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) called the
commonest tact--as if this principle alone would suffice to light their
way; there were others when it might have seemed, to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), that
their course would demand of them the most anxious study and the most
independent, not to say original, interpretation of signs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) talked
now as if it were indicated, at every turn, by finger-posts of almost
ridiculous prominence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) talked again as if it lurked in devious
ways and were to be tracked through bush and briar; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) even, on
occasion, delivered herself in the sense that, as their situation was
unprecedented, so their heaven was without stars. ```Do'?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) once
had echoed to him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) as the upshot of passages covertly, though briefly,
occurring between them on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) return from the visit to America that had
immediately succeeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) marriage, determined for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) by this event as
promptly as an excursion of the like strange order had been prescribed
in his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) own case. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't the immense, the really quite matchless beauty
of our position that we have to `do' nothing in life at all?--nothing
except the usual, necessary, everyday thing which consists in one's not
being more of a fool than one can help. That's all--but that's as true
for one time as for another. There has been plenty of `doing,' and there
will doubtless be plenty still; but it's all theirs, every inch of it;
it's all a matter of what they've done TO us.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) showed how
the question had therefore been only of their taking everything as
everything came, and all as quietly as might be. Nothing stranger
surely had ever happened to a conscientious, a well-meaning, a perfectly
passive pair: no more extraordinary decree had ever been launched
against such victims than this of forcing them against their will into a
relation of mutual close contact that they had done everything to avoid.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to remember not a little, meanwhile, the particular prolonged
silent look with which the Prince had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) allusion to these primary
efforts at escape. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was inwardly to dwell on the element of the
unuttered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tone had caused to play up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) irresistible
eyes; and this because she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) considered with pride and joy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had,
on the spot, disposed of the doubt, the question, the challenge, or
whatever else might have been, that such a look could convey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
been sufficiently off his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) guard to show some little wonder as to their
having plotted so very hard against their destiny, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew well
enough, of course, what, in this connection, was at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
thought, and what would have sounded out more or less if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had not
happily saved himself from words. All men were brutes enough to catch
when they might at such chances for dissent--for all the good it really
did them; but the Prince's distinction was in being one of the few who
could check himself before acting on the impulse. This, obviously, was
what counted in a man as delicacy. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend had blurted or bungled
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would have said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) simplicity, <div class="bookquote">``Did we do `everything to avoid'
it when we faced your remarkable marriage?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--quite handsomely of course
using the plural, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) share of the case, by way of a tribute
of memory to the telegram she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had received from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in Paris after
Mr. Verver had despatched to Rome the news of their engagement.
That telegram, that acceptance of the prospect proposed to them--an
acceptance quite other than perfunctory--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had never destroyed; though
reserved for no eyes but her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own it was still carefully reserved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
kept it in a safe place--from which, very privately, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sometimes took
it out to read it over. <div class="bookquote">``A la guerre comme a la guerre then'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--it had
been couched in the French tongue. <div class="bookquote">``We must lead our lives as we see
them; but I am charmed with your courage and almost surprised at my
own.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The message had remained ambiguous; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had read it in more lights
than one; it might mean that even without her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) career was up-hill
work for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), a daily fighting-matter on behalf of a good appearance,
and that thus, if they were to become neighbours again, the event would
compel him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to live still more under arms. It might mean on the other
hand that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was happy enough, and that accordingly, so far as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might imagine herself a danger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) as prepared
in advance, as really seasoned and secure. On his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) arrival in Paris with
his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wife, none the less, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had asked for no explanation, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
himself had not asked if the document were still in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) possession. Such
an inquiry, everything implied, was beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)--just as it was beneath
herself to mention to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), uninvited, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had instantly offered,
and in perfect honesty, to show the telegram to Mr. Verver, and that if
this companion had but said the word she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would immediately have put
it before him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had thereby forborne to call his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) attention to
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) consciousness that such an exposure would, in all probability,
straightway have dished her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marriage; that all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) future had in fact,
for the moment, hung by the single hair of Mr. Verver's delicacy -LRB-as
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) supposed they must call it-RRB-; and that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) position, in the matter of
responsibility, was therefore inattackably straight.

<p/>For the Prince himself, meanwhile, time, in its measured allowance, had
originally much helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in the sense of there not
being enough of it to trip him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) up; in spite of which it was just this
accessory element that seemed, at present, with wonders of patience,
to lie in wait. Time had begotten at first, more than anything else,
separations, delays and intervals; but it was troublesomely less of
an aid from the moment it began so to abound that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had to meet the
question of what to do with it. Less of it was required for the state of
being married than he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had, on the whole, expected; less, strangely, for
the state of being married even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was married. And there was a
logic in the matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew; a logic that but gave this truth a sort
of solidity of evidence. Mr. Verver, decidedly, helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) with it--with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wedded condition; helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) really so much that it made all the
difference. In the degree in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) rendered it the service on Mr.
Verver's part was remarkable--as indeed what service, from the first
of their meeting, had not been? He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was living, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had been living these
four or five years, on Mr. Verver's services: a truth scarcely less
plain if he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) dealt with them, for appreciation, one by one, than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
poured them all together into the general pot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) gratitude and let
the thing simmer to a nourishing broth. To the latter way with them he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
was undoubtedly most disposed; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) would even thus, on occasion, pick
out a piece to taste on its own merits. Wondrous at such hours could
seem the savour of the particular <div class="bookquote">``treat,''  (<font color='red'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)</div>at his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) father-in-law's
expense, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) more and more struck himself as enjoying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had
needed months and months to arrive at a full appreciation--he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) couldn't
originally have given offhand a name to his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) deepest obligation; but by
the time the name had flowered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was practically living at
the ease guaranteed him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>). Mr. Verver then, in a word, took care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
relation to Maggie, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) took care, and apparently always would, of
everything else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) of all anxiety about his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) married
life in the same manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) on the score of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
bank-account. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) performed the latter office by communicating
with the bankers, so the former sprang as directly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
good understanding with his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter. This understanding had,
wonderfully--THAT was in high evidence--the same deep intimacy as the
commercial, the financial association founded, far down, on a community
of interest. And the correspondence, for the Prince, carried itself
out in identities of character the vision of which, fortunately, rather
tended to amuse than to--as might have happened--irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). Those
people--and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) free synthesis lumped together capitalists and
bankers, retired men of business, illustrious collectors, American
fathers-in-law, American fathers, little American daughters, little
American wives--those people were of the same large lucky group, as one
might say; they were all, at least, of the same general species and had
the same general instincts; they hung together, they passed each other
the word, they spoke each other's language, they did each other <div class="bookquote">``turns.''
 (<font color='red'><b>those people</b></font>)</div>In this last connection it of course came up for our young man at a
given moment that Maggie's relation with HIM was also, on the perceived
basis, taken care of. Which was in fact the real upshot of the matter.
It was a <div class="bookquote">``funny''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>situation--that is it was funny just as it stood. Their
married life was in question, but the solution was, not less strikingly,
before them. It was all right for himself, because Mr. Verver worked
it so for Maggie's comfort; and it was all right for Maggie, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
worked it so for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband's.

<p/>The fact that time, however, was not, as we have said, wholly on the
Prince's side might have shown for particularly true one dark day on
which, by an odd but not unprecedented chance, the reflections just
noted offered themselves as his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) main recreation. They alone, it
appeared, had been appointed to fill the hours for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), and even to fill
the great square house in Portland Place, where the scale of one of the
smaller saloons fitted them but loosely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had looked into this room
on the chance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might find the Princess at tea; but though the
fireside service of the repast was shiningly present the mistress of the
table was not, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), if waiting it could be called,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) measured again and again the stretch of polished floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
could have named to himself no pressing reason for seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) at this
moment, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) not coming in, as the half-hour elapsed, became in fact
quite positively, however perversely, the circumstance that kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) on
the spot. Just there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might have been feeling, just there he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could
best take his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) note. This observation was certainly by itself meagre
amusement for a dreary little crisis; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) walk to and fro, and in
particular his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) repeated pause at one of the high front windows, gave
each of the ebbing minutes, none the less, after a time, a little more
of the quality of a quickened throb of the spirit. These throbs scarce
expressed, however, the impatience of desire, any more than they stood
for sharp disappointment: the series together resembled perhaps more
than anything else those fine waves of clearness through which, for
a watcher of the east, dawn at last trembles into rosy day. The
illumination indeed was all for the mind, the prospect revealed by it a
mere immensity of the world of thought; the material outlook was all the
while a different matter. The March afternoon, judged at the window,
had blundered back into autumn; it had been raining for hours, and the
colour of the rain, the colour of the air, of the mud, of the opposite
houses, of life altogether, in so grim a joke, so idiotic a masquerade,
was an unutterable dirty brown. There was at first even, for the
young man, no faint flush in the fact of the direction taken, while
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happened to look out, by a slow-jogging four-wheeled cab which,
awkwardly deflecting from the middle course, at the apparent instance
of a person within, began to make for the left-hand pavement and so at
last, under further instructions, floundered to a full stop before the
Prince's windows. The person within, alighting with an easier motion,
proved to be a lady who left the vehicle to wait and, putting up no
umbrella, quickly crossed the wet interval that separated her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from
the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) but flitted and disappeared; yet the Prince, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
standpoint, had had time to recognise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and the recognition kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
for some minutes motionless.

<p/>Charlotte Stant, at such an hour, in a shabby four-wheeler and a
waterproof, Charlotte Stant turning up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) at the very climax of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) special inner vision, was an apparition charged with a congruity at
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) stared almost as if it had been a violence. The effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>)
coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) only, had, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) stood waiting, a singular
intensity--though after some minutes had passed the certainty of this
began to drop. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Stant</b></font>) had NOT come, or had come only for Maggie;
perhaps, on learning below that the Princess had not returned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was
merely leaving a message, writing a word on a card. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) should see, at
any rate; and meanwhile, controlling himself, would do nothing. This
thought of not interfering took on a sudden force for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would
doubtless hear he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was at home, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would let her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) visit to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) be all
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) own choosing. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) view of a reason for leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) free was
the more remarkable that, though taking no step, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) yet intensely hoped.
The harmony of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) breaking into sight while the superficial conditions
were so against her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was a harmony with conditions that were far from
superficial and that gave, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) imagination, an extraordinary value
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) presence. The value deepened strangely, moreover, with the rigour
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own attitude--with the fact too that, listening hard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) neither
heard the house-door close again nor saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) cab; and
it had risen to a climax by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had become aware, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
quickened sense, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had followed the butler up to the landing from
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) room opened. If anything could further then have added to
it, the renewed pause outside, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had said to the man <div class="bookquote">``Wait a
moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>would have constituted this touch. Yet when the man had shown
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) in, had advanced to the tea-table to light the lamp under the kettle
and had then busied himself, all deliberately, with the fire, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) made
it easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) host to drop straight from any height of tension and
to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), provisionally, on the question of Maggie. While the butler
remained it was Maggie that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had come to see and Maggie that--in
spite of this attendant's high blankness on the subject of all
possibilities on that lady's part--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would cheerfully, by the fire,
wait for. As soon as they were alone together, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mounted, as
with the whizz and the red light of a rocket, from the form to the fact,
saying straight out, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``What else, my
dear, what in the world else can we do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) then knew, on the spot, why he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) had been feeling, for
hours, as he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) had felt--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) in fact knew, within the minute, things
he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) had not known even while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was panting, as from the effect of the
staircase, at the door of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) knew at the same time, none the
less, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew still more than he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>)--in the sense, that is, of all
the signs and portents that might count for them; and his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) vision
of alternative--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could scarce say what to call them, solutions,
satisfactions--opened out, altogether, with this tangible truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
attitude by the chimney-place, the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) as through the
gained advantage of it; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) right hand resting on the marble and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
left keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) skirt from the fire while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held out a foot to dry.
He (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) couldn't have told what particular links and gaps had at the end of
a few minutes found themselves renewed and bridged; for he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) remembered
no occasion, in Rome, from which the picture could have been so exactly
copied. He (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) remembered, that is, none of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) in the
rain while a muddy four-wheeler waited, and while, though having
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) waterproof downstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was yet invested with the odd
eloquence--the positive picturesqueness, yes, given all the rest of the
matter--of a dull dress and a black Bowdlerised hat that seemed to make
a point of insisting on their time of life and their moral intention,
the hat's and the frock's own, as well as on the irony of indifference
to them practically playing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) so handsome rain-freshened face. The
sense of the past revived for him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) nevertheless as it had not yet done:
it made that other time somehow meet the future close, interlocking with
it, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) watching eyes, as in a long embrace of arms and lips,
and so handling and hustling the present that this poor quantity scarce
retained substance enough, scarce remained sufficiently THERE, to be
wounded or shocked.

<p/>What had happened, in short, was that Charlotte and he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had, by a single
turn of the wrist of fate--<div class="bookquote">``led up''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to indeed, no doubt, by steps and
stages that conscious computation had missed--been placed face to face
in a freedom that partook, extraordinarily, of ideal perfection, since
the magic web had spun itself without their toil, almost without their
touch. Above all, on this occasion, once more, there sounded through
their safety, as an undertone, the very voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had listened to on the
eve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) marriage with such another sort of unrest. Dimly, again and
again, from that period on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had seemed to hear it tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) why it
kept recurring; but it phrased the large music now in a way that filled
the room. The reason was--into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had lived, quite intimately, by
the end of a quarter-of-an-hour--that just this truth of their safety
offered it now a kind of unexampled receptacle, letting it spread and
spread, but at the same time elastically enclosing it, banking it in,
for softness, as with billows of eiderdown. On that morning; in the Park
there had been, however dissimulated, doubt and danger, whereas the tale
this afternoon was taken up with a highly emphasised confidence. The
emphasis, for their general comfort, was what Charlotte had come to
apply; inasmuch as, though it was not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) definitely began with, it
had soon irrepressibly shaped itself. It was the meaning of the question
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had put to him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) as soon as they were alone--even though indeed, as
from not quite understanding, he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) had not then directly replied; it was
the meaning of everything else, down to the conscious quaintness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ricketty <div class="bookquote">``growler''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the conscious humility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dress. It had
helped him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) a little, the question of these eccentricities, to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
immediate appeal pass without an answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) could ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) instead what
had become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) carriage and why, above all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was not using it in
such weather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just because of the weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``It's my little idea.
It makes me feel as I used to--when I could do as I liked.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>XVIII

<p/>This came out so straight that he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) saw at once how much truth it
expressed; yet it was truth that still a little puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But did
you ever like knocking about in such discomfort?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me now that I then liked everything. It's the charm, at
any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) place at the fire, <div class="bookquote">``of trying again the
old feelings. They come back--they come back. Everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on,
<div class="bookquote">``comes back. Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``you know for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) stood near her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) pockets; but not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>),
looking hard at the tea-table. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I haven't your courage. Moreover,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``it seems to me that, so far as that goes, I do live in
hansoms. But you must awfully want your tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) quickly added; <div class="bookquote">``so let
me give you a good stiff cup.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) busied himself with this care, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sat down, on his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) pushing up
a low seat, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been standing; so that, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) talked, he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>)
could bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) further desired. He (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) moved to and fro before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) helped himself; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) visit, as the moments passed, had more
and more the effect of a signal communication that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had come, all
responsibly and deliberately, as on the clear show of the clock-face
of their situation, to make. The whole demonstration, none the less,
presented itself as taking place at a very high level of debate--in the
cool upper air of the finer discrimination, the deeper sincerity, the
larger philosophy. No matter what were the facts invoked and arrayed,
it was only a question, as yet, of their seeing their way together: to
which indeed, exactly, the present occasion appeared to have so much to
contribute. <div class="bookquote">``It's not that you haven't my courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>Charlotte said,
<div class="bookquote">``but that you haven't, I rather think, my imagination. Unless indeed
it should turn out after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that you haven't even my
intelligence. However, I shall not be afraid of that till you've given
me more proof.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) made again, but more clearly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) point of a
moment before. <div class="bookquote">``You knew, besides, you knew to-day, I would come. And
if you knew that you know everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pursued, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't
meanwhile, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't even at this, take her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) up, it might be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
was so positively fitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) again with the fair face of temporising
kindness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes on, at the other
important juncture, and the sense of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might ever since have
been carrying about with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) like a precious medal--not exactly blessed
by the Pope suspended round her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) neck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had come back, however this
might be, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) immediate account of herself, and no mention of their
great previous passage was to rise to the lips of either. <div class="bookquote">``Above all,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there has been the personal romance of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of tea with me over the fire? Ah, so far as that goes I don't think
even my intelligence fails me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's further than that goes; and if I've had a better day than you
it's perhaps, when I come to think of it, that I AM braver. You bore
yourself, you see. But I don't. I don't, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's precisely boring one's self without relief,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) protested, <div class="bookquote">``that
takes courage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Passive then--not active. My romance is that, if you want to know, I've
been all day on the town. Literally on the town--isn't that what they
call it? I know how it feels.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>After which, as if breaking off, <div class="bookquote">``And
you, have you never been out?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) still stood there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) pockets. <div class="bookquote">``What should I have
gone out for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what should people in our case do anything for? But you're
wonderful, all of YOU--you know how to live. We're clumsy brutes, we
other's, beside you--we must always be `doing' something. However,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte pursued, <div class="bookquote">``if you had gone out you might have missed the chance
of me--which I'm sure, though you won't confess it, was what you didn't
want; and might have missed, above all, the satisfaction that, look
blank about it as you will, I've come to congratulate you on. That's
really what I can at last do. You can't not know at least, on such a day
as this--you can't not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``where you are.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) waited as
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) either to grant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) knew or to pretend that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) didn't;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) only drew a long deep breath which came out like a moan of
impatience. It brushed aside the question of where he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) was or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)
knew; it seemed to keep the ground clear for the question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) visitor
herself, that of Charlotte Verver exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) sat there. So, for some
moments, with their long look, they but treated the matter in silence;
with the effect indeed, by the end of the time, of having considerably
brought it on. This was sufficiently marked in what Charlotte next said.
<div class="bookquote">``There it all is--extraordinary beyond words. It makes such a relation
for us as, I verily believe, was never before in the world thrust upon
two well-meaning creatures. Haven't we therefore to take things as we
find them?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) put the question still more directly than that of
a moment before, but to this one, as well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) returned no immediate
answer. Noticing only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cup, carried it back to the table, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) what more she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would
have; and then, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Nothing, thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>returned to the fire and
restored a displaced log to position by a small but almost too effectual
kick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had meanwhile got up again, and it was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) feet that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
repeated the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had first frankly spoken. <div class="bookquote">``What else can we do,
what in all the world else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) took them up, however, no more than at first. <div class="bookquote">``Where then have you
been?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) asked as from mere interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) adventure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everywhere I could think of--except to see people. I didn't
want people--I wanted too much to think. But I've been back at
intervals--three times; and then come away again. My cabman must think
me crazy--it's very amusing; I shall owe him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), when we come to settle,
more money than he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has ever seen. I've been, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``to
the British Museum--which, you know, I always adore. And I've been to
the National Gallery, and to a dozen old booksellers', coming across
treasures, and I've lunched, on some strange nastiness, at a cookshop
in Holborn. I wanted to go to the Tower, but it was too far--my old
man urged that; and I would have gone to the Zoo if it hadn't been too
wet--which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also begged me to observe. But you wouldn't believe--I
did put in St. Paul's. Such days,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``are expensive; for,
besides the cab, I've bought quantities of books.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) immediately
passed, at any rate, to another point: <div class="bookquote">``I can't help wondering when you
must last have laid eyes on them.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And then as it had apparently for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
companion an effect of abruptness: <div class="bookquote">``Maggie, I mean, and the child. For I
suppose you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'s with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion effect</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'s with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). I saw them this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did they then announce their programme?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), as usual, da nonno.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for the whole day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hesitated, but it was as if his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) attitude had slowly shifted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't say. And I didn't ask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``it can't have been later than half-past ten--I
mean when you saw them. They had got to Eaton Square before eleven.
You know we don't formally breakfast, Adam and I; we have tea in our
rooms--at least I have; but luncheon is early, and I saw my husband,
this morning, by twelve; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was showing the child a picture-book. Maggie
had been there with them, had left them settled together. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
gone out--taking the carriage for something he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been intending but
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) offered to do instead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince appeared to confess, at this, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Taking, you mean, YOUR carriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know which, and it doesn't matter. It's not a question,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
smiled, <div class="bookquote">``of a carriage the more or the less. It's not a question even,
if you come to that, of a cab. It's so beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that it's
not a question of anything vulgar or horrid.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) time to
agree about; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was silent it was, rather remarkably, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) fell in. <div class="bookquote">``I went out--I wanted to. I had my idea. It seemed to me
important. It has BEEN--it IS important. I know as I haven't known
before the way they feel. I couldn't in any other way have made so sure
of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They feel a confidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince observed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had indeed said it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``They feel a confidence.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
proceeded, with lucidity, to the fuller illustration of it; speaking
again of the three different moments that, in the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wild
ramble, had witnessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) return--for curiosity, and even really a
little from anxiety--to Eaton Square. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was possessed of a latch-key,
rarely used: it had always irritated Adam--one of the few things that
did--to find servants standing up so inhumanly straight when they came
home, in the small hours, after parties. <div class="bookquote">``So I had but to slip in, each
time, with my cab at the door, and make out for myself, without their
knowing it, that Maggie was still there. I came, I went--without their
so much as dreaming. What do they really suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``becomes
of one?--not so much sentimentally or morally, so to call it, and since
that doesn't matter; but even just physically, materially, as a mere
wandering woman: as a decent harmless wife, after all; as the best
stepmother, after all, that really ever was; or at the least simply as
a maitresse de maison not quite without a conscience. They must even in
their odd way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) declared, <div class="bookquote">``have SOME idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they've a great deal of idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>said the Prince. And nothing was
easier than to mention the quantity. <div class="bookquote">``They think so much of us. They
think in particular so much of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, don't put it all on `me'!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smiled.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was putting it now where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had admirably prepared the place.
<div class="bookquote">``It's a matter of your known character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, thank you for `known'!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) still smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a matter of your wonderful cleverness and wonderful charm. It's
a matter of what those things have done for you in the world--I mean in
THIS world and this place. You're a Personage for them--and Personages
do go and come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, my dear; there you're quite wrong.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) laughed now in the
happier light they had diffused. <div class="bookquote">``That's exactly what Personages don't
do: they live in state and under constant consideration; they haven't
latch-keys, but drums and trumpets announce them; and when they go out
in growlers it makes a greater noise still. It's you, caro mio,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``who, so far as that goes, are the Personage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in turn protested, <div class="bookquote">``don't put it all on me! What, at any rate,
when you get home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``shall you say that you've been doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall say, beautifully, that I've been here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--all day. Keeping you company in your solitude. How can we
understand anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``without really seeing that this
is what they must like to think I do for you?--just as, quite as
comfortably, you do it for me. The thing is for us to learn to take them
as they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) considered this a while, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) restless way, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes
not turning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); after which, rather disconnectedly, though very
vehemently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) brought out: <div class="bookquote">``How can I not feel more than anything else
how they adore together my boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then, further, as if, slightly
disconcerted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had nothing to meet this and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) quickly perceived the
effect: <div class="bookquote">``They would have done the same for one of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, if I could have had one--! I hoped and I believed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte,
<div class="bookquote">``that that would happen. It would have been better. It would have made
perhaps some difference. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought so too, poor duck--that it might
have been. I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hoped and intended so. It's not, at any rate,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``my fault. There it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had uttered these statements,
one by one, gravely, sadly and responsibly, owing it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend to
be clear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) paused briefly, but, as if once for all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
clearness complete. <div class="bookquote">``And now I'm too sure. It will never be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) waited for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Never?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They treated the matter not exactly with solemnity, but with
a certain decency, even perhaps urgency, of distinctness. <div class="bookquote">``It would
probably have been better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte added. <div class="bookquote">``But things turn out--! And
it leaves us'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) made the point--<div class="bookquote">``more alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seemed to wonder. <div class="bookquote">``It leaves you more alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) again returned, <div class="bookquote">``don't put it all on me! Maggie would have
given herself to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) child, I'm sure, scarcely less than he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gives
himself to yours. It would have taken more than any child of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
explained--<div class="bookquote">``it would have taken more than ten children of mine, could I
have had them--to keep our sposi apart.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smiled as for the breadth
of the image, but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seemed to take it, in spite of this, for
important, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) then spoke gravely enough. <div class="bookquote">``It's as strange as you like,
but we're immensely alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) kept vaguely moving, but there were
moments when, again, with an awkward ease and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pockets,
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was more directly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stood there at these last words,
which had the effect of making him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) for a little throw back his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) head and,
as thinking something out, stare up at the ceiling. <div class="bookquote">``What will you
say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) meanwhile asked, <div class="bookquote">``that you've been doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This brought his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
consciousness and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) question. <div class="bookquote">``I
mean when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) comes in--for I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) WILL, some time, come in. It
seems to me we must say the same thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought again. <div class="bookquote">``Yet I can scarce pretend to have had what I
haven't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, WHAT haven't you had?--what aren't you having?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) question rang out as they lingered face to face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) still took
it, before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) answered, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``We must at least then, not to be
absurd together, do the same thing. We must act, it would really seem,
in concert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would really seem!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyebrows, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shoulders went up, quite in
gaiety, as for the relief this brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's all in the world I
pretend. We must act in concert. Heaven knows,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``THEY do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) evidently saw and that, by his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) admission, the case,
could fairly be put. But what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) evidently saw appeared to come over
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), at the same time, as too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fell back
suddenly to ground where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was not awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The difficulty is,
and will always be, that I don't understand them. I didn't at first, but
I thought I should learn to. That was what I hoped, and it appeared then
that Fanny Assingham might help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Fanny Assingham!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Verver</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte Verver.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stared a moment at her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) tone. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would do anything for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>To which Charlotte at first said nothing--as if from the sense of too
much. Then, indulgently enough, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``We're beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought a moment--as of where this placed them. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)'d do anything
then for THEM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, so would we--so that doesn't help us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has broken down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
doesn't understand us. And really, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte added, <div class="bookquote">``Fanny
Assingham doesn't matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wondered again. <div class="bookquote">``Unless as taking care of THEM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte instantly said, <div class="bookquote">``isn't it for us, only, to do that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
spoke as with a flare of pride for their privilege and their duty. <div class="bookquote">``I
think we want no one's aid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spoke indeed with a nobleness not the less effective for coming in
so oddly; with a sincerity visible even through the complicated twist
by which any effort to protect the father and the daughter seemed
necessarily conditioned for them. It moved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), in any case, as if some
spring of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own, a weaker one, had suddenly been broken by it. These
things, all the while, the privilege, the duty, the opportunity, had
been the substance of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own vision; they formed the note he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been
keeping back to show her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not, in their so special situation,
without a responsible view. A conception that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could name, and could
act on, was something that now, at last, not to be too eminent a fool,
he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was required by all the graces to produce, and the luminous idea
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had herself uttered would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) expression of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had
anticipated him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), but, as her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) expression left, for positive beauty,
nothing to be desired, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) felt rather righted than wronged. A large
response, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), came into his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) face, a light of excited
perception all his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own, in the glory of which--as it almost might be
called--what he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) back had the value of what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had, given him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``They're extraordinarily happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, Charlotte's measure of it was only too full. <div class="bookquote">``Beatifically.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the great thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``so that it doesn't matter,
really, that one doesn't understand. Besides, you do--enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand my husband perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) after an instant conceded. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't understand your wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're of the same race, at any rate--more or less; of the same general
tradition and education, of the same moral paste. There are things you
have in common with them. But I, on my side, as I've gone on trying to
see if I haven't some of these things too--I, on my side, have more and
more failed. There seem at last to be none worth mentioning. I can't
help seeing it--I'm decidedly too different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet you're not'' (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>--Charlotte made the important point--<div class="bookquote">``too different
from ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--as we're not married. That brings things out. Perhaps if
we were,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you WOULD find some abyss of divergence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since it depends on that then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``I'm safe--as you are
anyhow. Moreover, as one has so often had occasion to feel, and even to
remark, they're very, very simple. That makes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``a difficulty
for belief; but when once one has taken it in it makes less difficulty
for action. I HAVE at last, for myself, I think, taken it in. I'm not
afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wondered a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Not afraid of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, generally, of some beastly mistake. Especially of any mistake
founded on one's idea of their difference. For that idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte
developed, <div class="bookquote">``positively makes one so tender.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but rather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, there it is. I can't put myself into Maggie's skin--I can't,
as I say. It's not my fit--I shouldn't be able, as I see it, to breathe
in it. But I can feel that I'd do anything--to shield it from a bruise.
Tender as I am for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``I think I'm still more so for
my husband. HE (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'S in truth of a sweet simplicity--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince turned over a while the sweet simplicity of Mr. Verver.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know that I can choose. At night all cats are grey. I
only see how, for so many reasons, we ought to stand toward them--and
how, to do ourselves justice, we do. It represents for us a conscious
care--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of every hour, literally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could rise to the
highest measure of the facts. <div class="bookquote">``And for which we must trust each
other--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, as we trust the saints in glory. Fortunately,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince hastened
to add, <div class="bookquote">``we can.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>With which, as for the full assurance and the pledge
it involved, their hands instinctively found their hands. <div class="bookquote">``It's all too
wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Firmly and gravely she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``It's too beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And so for a minute they stood together, as strongly held and as closely
confronted as any hour of their easier past even had seen them. They
were silent at first, only facing and faced, only grasping and grasped,
only meeting and met. <div class="bookquote">``It's sacred,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's sacred,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) breathed back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). They vowed it, gave it out and
took it in, drawn, by their intensity, more closely together. Then of
a sudden, through this tightened circle, as at the issue of a narrow
strait into the sea beyond, everything broke up, broke down, gave way,
melted and mingled. Their lips sought their lips, their pressure their
response and their response their pressure; with a violence that had
sighed itself the next moment to the longest and deepest of stillnesses
they passionately sealed their pledge.



<p/>XIX

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had taken it from her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>), as we have seen, moreover, that Fanny
Assingham didn't now matter--the <div class="bookquote">``now''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had even himself supplied, as
no more than fair to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) sense of various earlier stages; and, though
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) assent remained scarce more than tacit, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) behaviour, for the hour,
so fell into line that, for many days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) kept postponing the visit he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
had promised his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) old friend on the occasion of their talk at the
Foreign Office. With regret, none the less, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) have seen it quite
extinguished, that theory of their relation as attached pupil and kind
instructress in which they had from the first almost equally found a
convenience. It had been he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), no doubt, who had most put it forward,
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) need of knowledge fairly exceeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) mild pretension; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
had again and again repeated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) should never, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>),
have been where he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had not successfully concealed the
pleasure it might give her (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to believe it, even after the question of
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was had begun to show itself as rather more closed than open
to interpretation. It had never indeed, before that evening, come up as
during the passage at the official party, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had for the first
time at those moments, a little disappointedly, got the impression of a
certain failure, on the dear woman's part, of something he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was aware of
having always rather freely taken for granted in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Of what exactly
the failure consisted he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would still perhaps have felt it a little harsh
to try to say; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had in fact, as by Charlotte's observation,
<div class="bookquote">``broken down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>the details of the collapse would be comparatively
unimportant. They came to the same thing, all such collapses--the
failure of courage, the failure of friendship, or the failure just
simply of tact; for didn't any one of them by itself amount really to
the failure of wit?--which was the last thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had expected of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
and which would be but another name for the triumph of stupidity. It had
been Charlotte's remark that they were at last <div class="bookquote">``beyond''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
had ever enjoyed believing that a certain easy imagination in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would
keep up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to the end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) shrank from affixing a label to Mrs.
Assingham's want of faith; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) thought, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) ease, of the
way persons who were capable really entertained--or at least with any
refinement--the passion of personal loyalty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) figured for them a play
of fancy neither timorous nor scrupulous. So would his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) personal loyalty,
if need be, have accepted the adventure for the good creature herself;
to that definite degree that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had positively almost missed the luxury
of some such call from her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). That was what it all came back to again with
these people among whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was married--that one found one used one's
imagination mainly for wondering how they contrived so little to appeal
to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) felt at moments as if there were never anything to do for them
that was worthy--to call worthy--of the personal relation; never any
charming charge to take of any confidence deeply reposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might
vulgarly have put it that one had never to plot or to lie for them;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might humourously have put it that one had never, as by the higher
conformity, to lie in wait with the dagger or to prepare, insidiously,
the cup. These were the services that, by all romantic tradition, were
consecrated to affection quite as much as to hate. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could amuse
himself with saying--so far as the amusement went--that they were what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had once for all turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) back on.

<p/>Fanny was meanwhile frequent, it appeared, in Eaton Square; so much
he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) gathered from the visitor who was not infrequent, least of all at
tea-time, during the same period, in Portland Place; though they had
little need to talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) after practically agreeing that they had
outlived her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). To the scene of these conversations and suppressions Mrs.
Assingham herself made, actually, no approach; her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) latest view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
utility seeming to be that it had found in Eaton Square its most urgent
field. It was finding there in fact everything and everyone but the
Prince, who mostly, just now, kept away, or who, at all events, on the
interspaced occasions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) calling, happened not to encounter the
only person from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was a little estranged. It would have been
all prodigious if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had not already, with Charlotte's aid, so very
considerably lived into it--it would have been all indescribably
remarkable, this fact that, with wonderful causes for it so operating on
the surface, nobody else, as yet, in the combination, seemed estranged
from anybody. If Mrs. Assingham delighted in Maggie she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) knew by
this time how most easily to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was unhappy about
Charlotte she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) knew, by the same reasoning, how most probably to miss
that vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) on which affliction would feed. It might feed of
course on finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) so absent from her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) home--just as this particular
phenomenon of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) domestic detachment could be, by the anxious mind,
best studied there. Fanny was, however, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reasons, <div class="bookquote">``shy''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>of
Portland Place itself--this was appreciable; so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might well,
after all, have no great light on the question of whether Charlotte's
appearances there were frequent or not, any more than on that of the
account they might be keeping of the usual solitude -LRB-since it came
to this-RRB- of the head of that house. There was always, to cover all
ambiguities, to constitute a fund of explanation for the divisions of
Mrs. Verver's day, the circumstance that, at the point they had all
reached together, Mrs. Verver was definitely and by general acclamation
in charge of the <div class="bookquote">``social relations''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Verver</b></font>)</div>of the family, literally of those of
the two households; as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) genius for representing which in the
great world and in the grand style vivid evidence had more and more
accumulated. It had been established in the two households at an early
stage, and with the highest good-humour, that Charlotte was a, was THE,
<div class="bookquote">``social success,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>whereas the Princess, though kind, though punctilious,
though charming, though in fact the dearest little creature in the world
and the Princess into the bargain, was distinctly not, would distinctly
never be, and might as well, practically, give it up: whether through
being above it or below it, too much outside of it or too much lost in
it, too unequipped or too indisposed, didn't especially matter. What
sufficed was that the whole thing, call it appetite or call it
patience, the act of representation at large and the daily business of
intercourse, fell in with Charlotte's tested facility and, not much less
visibly, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) accommodating, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) generous, view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) domestic use.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had come, frankly, into the connection, to do and to be what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
could, <div class="bookquote">``no questions asked,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had taken over, accordingly, as it
stood, and in the finest practical spirit, the burden of a visiting-list
that Maggie, originally, left to herself, and left even more to the
Principino, had suffered to get inordinately out of hand.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had in a word not only mounted, cheerfully, the London
treadmill--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had handsomely professed herself, for the further comfort
of the three others, sustained in the effort by a <div class="bookquote">``frivolous side,''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>if
that were not too harsh a name for a pleasant constitutional curiosity.
There were possibilities of dulness, ponderosities of practice, arid
social sands, the bad quarters-of-an-hour that turned up like false
pieces in a debased currency, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made, on principle, very
nearly as light as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not been clever enough to distinguish. The
Prince had, on this score, paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) compliment soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
return from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wedding-tour in America, where, by all accounts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had wondrously borne the brunt; facing brightly, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband's side,
everything that came up--and what had come, often, was beyond words:
just as, precisely, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own interest only at stake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had thrown
up the game during the visit paid before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) marriage. The discussion of
the American world, the comparison of notes, impressions and adventures,
had been all at hand, as a ground of meeting for Mrs. Verver and her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
husband's son-in-law, from the hour of the reunion of the two couples.
Thus it had been, in short, that Charlotte could, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend's
appreciation, so promptly make her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) point; even using expressions from
which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) see, at the hour, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) drew amusement of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own.
<div class="bookquote">``What could be more simple than one's going through with everything,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had asked, <div class="bookquote">``when it's so plain a part of one's contract? I've got so
much, by my marriage'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had never for a moment concealed from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
how <div class="bookquote">``much''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had felt it and was finding it <div class="bookquote">``that I should deserve
no charity if I stinted my return. Not to do that, to give back on the
contrary all one can, are just one's decency and one's honour and one's
virtue. These things, henceforth, if you're interested to know, are my
rule of life, the absolute little gods of my worship, the holy images
set up on the wall. Oh yes, since I'm not a brute,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had wound
up, <div class="bookquote">``you shall see me as I AM!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Which was therefore as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--dealing always, from month to month, from day to day and from one
occasion to the other, with the duties of a remunerated office.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) perfect, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brilliant efficiency had doubtless, all the while,
contributed immensely to the pleasant ease in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
husband's daughter were lapped. It had in fact probably done something
more than this--it had given them a finer and sweeter view of the
possible scope of that ease. They had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in--on the crudest
expression of it--to do the <div class="bookquote">``worldly''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had done it with
such genius that they had themselves in consequence renounced it even
more than they had originally intended. In proportion as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did it,
moreover, was she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to be relieved of other and humbler doings; which
minor matters, by the properest logic, devolved therefore upon Maggie,
in whose chords and whose province they more naturally lay. Not less
naturally, by the same token, they included the repair, at the hands of
the latter young woman, of every stitch conceivably dropped by Charlotte
in Eaton Square. This was homely work, but that was just what made it
Maggie's. Bearing in mind dear Amerigo, who was so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own great
mundane feather, and whom the homeliness in question didn't, no doubt,
quite equally provide for--that would be, to balance, just in a manner
Charlotte's very most charming function, from the moment Charlotte could
be got adequately to recognise it.

<p/>Well, that Charlotte might be appraised as at last not ineffectually
recognising it, was a reflection that, during the days with which we are
actually engaged, completed in the Prince's breast these others, these
images and ruminations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) leisure, these gropings and fittings of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) conscience and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) experience, that we have attempted to set in
order there. They bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) company, not insufficiently--considering, in
especial, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) fuller resources in that line--while he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) worked out--to the
last lucidity the principle on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) forbore either to seek Fanny out
in Cadogan Place or to perpetrate the error of too marked an assiduity
in Eaton Square. This error would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) not availing himself to the
utmost of the convenience of any artless theory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) constitution, or
of Charlotte's, that might prevail there. That artless theories could
and did prevail was a fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) had ended by accepting, under copious
evidence, as definite and ultimate; and it consorted with common
prudence, with the simplest economy of life, not to be wasteful of any
odd gleaning. To haunt Eaton Square, in fine, would be to show that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) had not, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) brilliant associate, a sufficiency of work in the
world. It was just his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) having that sufficiency, it was just their having
it together, that, so strangely and so blessedly, made, as they put it
to each other, everything possible. What further propped up the case,
moreover, was that the <div class="bookquote">``world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eaton</b></font>)</div>by still another beautiful perversity of
their chance, included Portland Place without including to anything like
the same extent Eaton Square. The latter residence, at the same time, it
must promptly be added, did, on occasion, wake up to opportunity and,
as giving itself a frolic shake, send out a score of invitations--one
of which fitful flights, precisely, had, before Easter, the effect of
disturbing a little our young man's measure of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) margin. Maggie, with
a proper spirit, held that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father ought from time to time to give a
really considered dinner, and Mr. Verver, who had as little idea as ever
of not meeting expectation, was of the harmonious opinion that his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wife
ought. Charlotte's own judgment was, always, that they were ideally
free--the proof of which would always be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) maintained, that everyone
they feared they might most have alienated by neglect would arrive,
wreathed with smiles, on the merest hint of a belated signal. Wreathed
in smiles, all round, truly enough, these apologetic banquets struck
Amerigo as being; they were, frankly, touching occasions to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), marked,
in the great London bousculade, with a small, still grace of their own,
an investing amenity and humanity. Everybody came, everybody rushed;
but all succumbed to the soft influence, and the brutality of mere
multitude, of curiosity without tenderness, was put off, at the foot
of the fine staircase, with the overcoats and shawls. The entertainment
offered a few evenings before Easter, and at which Maggie and he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
were inevitably present as guests, was a discharge of obligations not
insistently incurred, and had thereby, possibly, all the more, the note
of this almost Arcadian optimism: a large, bright, dull, murmurous,
mild-eyed, middle-aged dinner, involving for the most part very bland,
though very exalted, immensely announceable and hierarchically placeable
couples, and followed, without the oppression of a later contingent, by
a brief instrumental concert, over the preparation of which, the Prince
knew, Maggie's anxiety had conferred with Charlotte's ingenuity and both
had supremely revelled, as it were, in Mr. Verver's solvency.

<p/>The Assinghams were there, by prescription, though quite at the foot of
the social ladder, and with the Colonel's wife, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) humility
of position, the Prince was more inwardly occupied than with any other
person except Charlotte. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was occupied with Charlotte because, in the
first place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looked so inordinately handsome and held so high, where
so much else was mature and sedate, the torch of responsive youth and
the standard of passive grace; and because of the fact that, in the
second, the occasion, so far as it referred itself with any confidence
of emphasis to a hostess, seemed to refer itself preferentially,
well-meaningly and perversely, to Maggie. It was not indistinguishable
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), when once they were all stationed, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife too had in
perfection her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own little character; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wondered how it managed so
visibly to simplify itself--and this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew, in spite of any desire
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) entertained--to the essential air of having overmuch on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind the
felicity, and indeed the very conduct and credit, of the feast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew,
as well, the other things of which her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) appearance was at any time--and
in Eaton Square especially--made up: her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) resemblance to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father, at
times so vivid, and coming out, in the delicate warmth of occasions,
like the quickened fragrance of a flower; her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) resemblance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
hit it off for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) once in Rome, in the first flushed days, after their
engagement, to a little dancing-girl at rest, ever so light of movement
but most often panting gently, even a shade compunctiously, on a bench;
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) approximation, finally--for it was analogy, somehow, more than
identity--to the transmitted images of rather neutral and negative
propriety that made up, in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) long line, the average of wifehood and
motherhood. If the Roman matron had been, in sufficiency, first and
last, the honour of that line, Maggie would no doubt, at fifty, have
expanded, have solidified to some such dignity, even should she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) suggest
a little but a Cornelia in miniature. A light, however, broke for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) in
season, and when once it had done so it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) more than ever aware
of Mrs. Verver's vaguely, yet quite exquisitely, contingent
participation--a mere hinted or tendered discretion; in short of Mrs.
Verver's indescribable, unfathomable relation to the scene. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) placed
condition, her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) natural seat and neighbourhood, her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) intenser presence,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) quieter smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) fewer jewels, were inevitably all as nothing
compared with the preoccupation that burned in Maggie like a small flame
and that had in fact kindled in each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheeks a little attesting,
but fortunately by no means unbecoming, spot. The party was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's
party, and its greater or smaller success was a question having for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
all the importance of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) importance; so that sympathy created for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
a sort of visible suspense, under pressure of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bristled with
filial reference, with little filial recalls of expression, movement,
tone. It was all unmistakable, and as pretty as possible, if one would,
and even as funny; but it put the pair so together, as undivided by the
marriage of each, that the Princess il n'y avait pas a dire--might sit
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) liked: she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would still, always, in that house, be irremediably
Maggie Verver. The Prince found himself on this occasion so beset with
that perception that its natural complement for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would really have
been to wonder if Mr. Verver had produced on people something of the
same impression in the recorded cases of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) having dined with his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
daughter.

<p/>This backward speculation, had it begun to play, however, would have
been easily arrested; for it was at present to come over Amerigo as
never before that his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) remarkable father-in-law was the man in the world
least equipped with different appearances for different hours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was
simple, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was a revelation of simplicity, and that was the end of him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) consisted of an appearance at all--a question that might
verily, for a weakness in it, have been argued. It amused our young man,
who was taking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleasure to-night, it will be seen, in sundry occult
ways, it amused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to feel how everything else the master of the
house consisted of, resources, possessions, facilities and amiabilities
amplified by the social legend, depended, for conveying the effect of
quantity, on no personal <div class="bookquote">``equation,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>no mere measurable medium. Quantity
was in the air for these good people, and Mr. Verver's estimable quality
was almost wholly in that pervasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was meagre and modest and
clearbrowed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) eyes, if they wandered without fear, yet stayed
without defiance; his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) shoulders were not broad, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) chest was not high,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) complexion was not fresh, and the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) head was not covered;
in spite of all of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) looked, at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) table, so nearly
like a little boy shyly entertaining in virtue of some imposed rank,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) COULD only be one of the powers, the representative of a
force--quite as an infant king is the representative of a dynasty. In
this generalised view of his (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) father-in-law, intensified to-night but
always operative, Amerigo had now for some time taken refuge. The
refuge, after the reunion of the two households in England, had more and
more offered itself as the substitute for communities, from man to man,
that, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) original calculation, might have become possible, but
that had not really ripened and flowered. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met the decent family eyes
across the table, met them afterwards in the music-room, but only to
read in them still what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had learned to read during his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first months,
the time of over-anxious initiation, a kind of apprehension in which
the terms and conditions were finally fixed and absolute. This directed
regard rested at its ease, but it neither lingered nor penetrated,
and was, to the Prince's fancy, much of the same order as any glance
directed, for due attention, from the same quarter, to the figure of a
cheque received in the course of business and about to be enclosed to a
banker. It made sure of the amount--and just so, from time to time,
the amount of the Prince was made sure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was being thus, in renewed
instalments, perpetually paid in; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) already reposed in the bank as a
value, but subject, in this comfortable way, to repeated, to infinite
endorsement. The net result of all of which, moreover, was that the
young man had no wish to see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) value diminish. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself, after all,
had not fixed it--the <div class="bookquote">``figure''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was a conception all of Mr. Verver's own.
Certainly, however, everything must be kept up to it; never so much as
to-night had the Prince felt this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would have been uncomfortable, as
these quiet expressions passed, had the case not been guaranteed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
by the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) accord with Charlotte. It was impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
should not now and again meet Charlotte's eyes, as it was also visible
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) too now and again met her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as well, in all
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pulses, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt the conveyed impression. It put them, it kept them
together, through the vain show of their separation, made the two other
faces, made the whole lapse of the evening, the people, the lights, the
flowers, the pretended talk, the exquisite music, a mystic golden bridge
between them, strongly swaying and sometimes almost vertiginous, for
that intimacy of which the sovereign law would be the vigilance of
<div class="bookquote">``care,''  (<font color='red'><b>the people lights flowers talk music bridge</b></font>)</div>would be never rashly to forget and never consciously to wound.



<p/>XX

<p/>The main interest of these hours for us, however, will have been in
the way the Prince continued to know, during a particular succession of
others, separated from the evening in Eaton Square by a short interval,
a certain persistent aftertaste. This was the lingering savour of a
cup presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) by Fanny Assingham's hand after dinner, while the
clustered quartette kept their ranged companions, in the music-room,
moved if one would, but conveniently motionless. Mrs. Assingham
contrived, after a couple of pieces, to convey to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) friend that, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) part, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was moved--by the genius of Brahms--beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could
bear; so that, without apparent deliberation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had presently floated
away, at the young man's side, to such a distance as permitted them
to converse without the effect of disdain. It was the twenty minutes
enjoyed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), during the rest of the concert, in the less associated
electric glare of one of the empty rooms--it was their achieved and, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have said, successful, most pleasantly successful, talk on one
of the sequestered sofas, it was this that was substantially to underlie
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) consciousness of the later occasion. The later occasion, then mere
matter of discussion, had formed her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) ground for desiring--in a light
undertone into which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quick ear read indeed some nervousness--these
independent words with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had sounded, covertly but distinctly, by
the time they were seated together, the great question of what it might
involve. It had come out for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before anything else, and so abruptly
that this almost needed an explanation. Then the abruptness itself
had appeared to explain--which had introduced, in turn, a slight
awkwardness. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know that they're not, after all, going to Matcham;
so that, if they don't--if, at least, Maggie doesn't--you won't, I
suppose, go by yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was, as I say, at Matcham, where the event
had placed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), it was at Matcham during the Easter days, that it most
befell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), oddly enough, to live over, inwardly, for its wealth of
special significance, this passage by which the event had been really
a good deal determined. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had paid, first and last, many an English
country visit; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had learned, even from of old, to do the English
things, and to do them, all sufficiently, in the English way; if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
didn't always enjoy them madly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enjoyed them at any rate as much,
to an appearance, as the good people who had, in the night of time,
unanimously invented them, and who still, in the prolonged afternoon of
their good faith, unanimously, even if a trifle automatically, practised
them; yet, with it all, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never so much as during such sojourns the
trick of a certain detached, the amusement of a certain inward critical,
life; the determined need, which apparently all participant, of
returning upon itself, of backing noiselessly in, far in again, and
rejoining there, as it were, that part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind that was not engaged
at the front. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body, very constantly, was engaged at the front--in
shooting, in riding, in golfing, in walking, over the fine diagonals
of meadow-paths or round the pocketed corners of billiard-tables; it
sufficiently, on the whole, in fact, bore the brunt of bridge-playing,
of breakfasting, lunching, tea-drinking, dining, and of the nightly
climax over the bottigliera, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called it, of the bristling tray; it
met, finally, to the extent of the limited tax on lip, on gesture,
on wit, most of the current demands of conversation and expression.
Therefore something of him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) often felt at these times, was left
out; it was much more when he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was alone, or when he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was with his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) own
people--or when he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was, say, with Mrs. Verver and nobody else--that he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
moved, that he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) talked, that he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) listened, that he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) felt, as a congruous
whole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``English society,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) would have said, cut him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), accordingly, in
two, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) reminded himself often, in his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) relations with it, of a
man possessed of a shining star, a decoration, an order of some sort,
something so ornamental as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) identity not complete, ideally,
without it, yet who, finding no other such object generally worn, should
be perpetually, and the least bit ruefully, unpinning it from his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) breast
to transfer it to his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) pocket. The Prince's shining star may, no doubt,
having been nothing more precious than his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) private subtlety; but
whatever the object was he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) just now fingered it a good deal, out of
sight--amounting as it mainly did for him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) to a restless play of memory
and a fine embroidery of thought. Something had rather momentously
occurred, in Eaton Square, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) enjoyed minutes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) old
friend: his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) present perspective made definitely clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
had plumped out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) first little lie. That took on--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) could
scarce have said why--a sharpness of importance: she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had never lied
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) before--if only because it had never come up for her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), properly,
intelligibly, morally, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) must. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had put to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) the
question of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) would do--by which she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) meant of what Charlotte would
also do--in that event of Maggie's and Mr. Verver's not embracing the
proposal they had appeared for a day or two resignedly to entertain; as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) curiosity as to the line the other pair, so
left to themselves, might take, a desire to avoid the appearance of
at all too directly prying had become marked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Betrayed by the
solicitude of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had, already, three weeks before, given him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) a
view, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been obliged, on a second thought, to name, intelligibly,
a reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) appeal; while the Prince, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) side, had had, not
without mercy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) momentarily groping for one and yet
remaining unprovided. Not without mercy because, absolutely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had on
the spot, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) friendliness, invented one for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) use, presenting it
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with a look no more significant than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had picked up, to hand
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), a dropped flower. <div class="bookquote">``You ask if I'm likely also to back
out then, because it may make a difference in what you and the Colonel
decide?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had gone as far as that for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), fairly inviting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
to assent, though not having had his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) impression, from any indication
offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) by Charlotte, that the Assinghams were really in question
for the large Matcham party. The wonderful thing, after this, was that
the active couple had, in the interval, managed to inscribe themselves
on the golden roll; an exertion of a sort that, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) justice,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had never before observed Fanny to make. This last passage of the
chapter but proved, after all, with what success she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could work when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
would.

<p/>Once launched, himself, at any rate, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had been directed by all the
terms of the intercourse between Portland Place and Eaton Square, once
steeped, at Matcham, in the enjoyment of a splendid hospitality, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>)
found everything, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) interpretation, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) convenience, fall
easily enough into place; and all the more that Mrs. Verver was at hand
to exchange ideas and impressions with. The great house was full of
people, of possible new combinations, of the quickened play of possible
propinquity, and no appearance, of course, was less to be cultivated
than that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) having sought an opportunity to foregather with his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>)
friend at a safe distance from their respective sposi. There was a happy
boldness, at the best, in their mingling thus, each unaccompanied,
in the same sustained sociability--just exactly a touch of that
eccentricity of associated freedom which sat so lightly on the
imagination of the relatives left behind. They were exposed as much
as one would to its being pronounced funny that they should, at such a
rate, go about together--though, on the other hand, this consideration
drew relief from the fact that, in their high conditions and with
the easy tradition, the almost inspiring allowances, of the house in
question, no individual line, however freely marked, was pronounced
anything more than funny. Both our friends felt afresh, as they had felt
before, the convenience of a society so placed that it had only its own
sensibility to consider--looking as it did well over the heads of all
lower growths; and that moreover treated its own sensibility quite as
the easiest, friendliest, most informal and domesticated party to the
general alliance. What anyone <div class="bookquote">``thought''  (<font color='red'><b>anyone</b></font>)</div>of anyone else--above all of
anyone else with anyone else--was a matter incurring in these lulls so
little awkward formulation that hovering judgment, the spirit with the
scales, might perfectly have been imaged there as some rather snubbed
and subdued, but quite trained and tactful poor relation, of equal, of
the properest, lineage, only of aspect a little dingy, doubtless from
too limited a change of dress, for whose tacit and abstemious presence,
never betrayed by a rattle of her (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>) rusty machine, a room in the attic and
a plate at the side-table were decently usual. It was amusing, in such
lightness of air, that the Prince should again present himself only to
speak for the Princess, so unfortunately unable, again, to leave home;
and that Mrs. Verver should as regularly figure as an embodied, a
beautifully deprecating apology for her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) husband, who was all geniality
and humility among his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own treasures, but as to whom the legend had
grown up that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) couldn't bear, with the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) standards and the
tone of the company, in the way of sofas and cabinets, habitually kept
by him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), the irritation and depression to which promiscuous visiting,
even at pompous houses, had been found to expose him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). That was all
right, the noted working harmony of the clever son-in-law and the
charming stepmother, so long as the relation was, for the effect in
question, maintained at the proper point between sufficiency and excess.

<p/>What with the noble fairness of the place, meanwhile, the generous mood
of the sunny, gusty, lusty English April, all panting and heaving with
impatience, or kicking and crying, even, at moments, like some infant
Hercules who wouldn't be dressed; what with these things and the bravery
of youth and beauty, the insolence of fortune and appetite so diffused
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) fellow-guests that the poor Assinghams, in their comparatively
marked maturity and their comparatively small splendour, were the only
approach to a false note in the concert, the stir of the air was
such, for going, in a degree, to one's head, that, as a mere matter of
exposure, almost grotesque in its flagrancy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) situation resembled
some elaborate practical joke carried out at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) expense. Every voice in
the great bright house was a call to the ingenuities and impunities
of pleasure; every echo was a defiance of difficulty, doubt or danger;
every aspect of the picture, a glowing plea for the immediate, and as
with plenty more to come, was another phase of the spell. For a world so
constituted was governed by a spell, that of the smile of the gods and
the favour of the powers; the only handsome, the only gallant, in fact
the only intelligent acceptance of which was a faith in its guarantees
and a high spirit for its chances. Its demand--to that the thing came
back--was above all for courage and good-humour; and the value of
this as a general assurance--that is for seeing one through at the
worst--had not even in the easiest hours of his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) old Roman life struck
the Prince so convincingly. His (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) old Roman life had had more poetry, no
doubt, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) looked back upon it now it seemed to hang in the air
of mere iridescent horizons, to have been loose and vague and thin, with
large languorous unaccountable blanks. The present order, as it spread
about him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), had somehow the ground under its feet, and a trumpet in its
ears, and a bottomless bag of solid shining British sovereigns--which
was much to the point--in its hand. Courage and good-humour therefore
were the breath of the day; though for ourselves at least it would have
been also much to the point that, with Amerigo, really, the innermost
effect of all this perceptive ease was perhaps a strange final
irritation. He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) compared the lucid result with the extraordinary
substitute for perception that presided, in the bosom of his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) wife, at
so contented a view of his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) conduct and course--a state of mind that was
positively like a vicarious good conscience, cultivated ingeniously on
his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) behalf, a perversity of pressure innocently persisted in; and this
wonder of irony became on occasion too intense to be kept wholly to
himself. It wasn't that, at Matcham, anything particular, anything
monstrous, anything that had to be noticed permitted itself, as they
said, to <div class="bookquote">``happen'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>; there were only odd moments when the breath of the
day, as it has been called, struck him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) so full in the face that he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) broke
out with all the hilarity of <div class="bookquote">``What indeed would THEY have made of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>were of course Maggie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, moping--so far as they
ever consented to mope in monotonous Eaton Square, but placid too in the
belief that they knew beautifully what their expert companions were
in for. They knew, it might have appeared in these lights, absolutely
nothing on earth worth speaking of--whether beautifully or cynically;
and they would perhaps sometimes be a little less trying if they would
only once for all peacefully admit that knowledge wasn't one of their
needs and that they were in fact constitutionally inaccessible to it.
They were good children, bless their hearts, and the children of good
children; so that, verily, the Principino himself, as less consistently
of that descent, might figure to the fancy as the ripest genius of the
trio.

<p/>The difficulty was, for the nerves of daily intercourse with Maggie in
particular, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagination was clearly never ruffled by the sense
of any anomaly. The great anomaly would have been that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband, or
even that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's wife, should prove to have been made, for the
long run, after the pattern set from so far back to the Ververs. If one
was so made one had certainly no business, on any terms, at Matcham;
whereas if one wasn't one had no business there on the particular
terms--terms of conformity with the principles of Eaton Square--under
which one had been so absurdly dedicated. Deep at the heart of that
resurgent unrest in our young man which we have had to content ourselves
with calling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) irritation--deep in the bosom of this falsity of
position glowed the red spark of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inextinguishable sense of a higher
and braver propriety. There were situations that were ridiculous, but
that one couldn't yet help, as for instance when one's wife chose, in
the most usual way, to make one so. Precisely here, however, was the
difference; it had taken poor Maggie to invent a way so extremely
unusual--yet to which, none the less, it would be too absurd that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
should merely lend himself. Being thrust, systematically, with another
woman, and a woman one happened, by the same token, exceedingly to
like, and being so thrust that the theory of it seemed to publish one
as idiotic or incapable--this WAS a predicament of which the dignity
depended all on one's own handling. What was supremely grotesque, in
fact, was the essential opposition of theories--as if a galantuomo, as
HE (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at least constitutionally conceived galantuomini, could do anything
BUT blush to <div class="bookquote">``go about''  (<font color='red'><b>HE</b></font>)</div>at such a rate with such a person as Mrs. Verver
in a state of childlike innocence, the state of our primitive parents
before the Fall. The grotesque theory, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have called it, was
perhaps an odd one to resent with violence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did it--also as a man
of the world--all merciful justice; but, assuredly, none the less, there
was but one way REALLY to mark, and for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion as much as for
himself, the commiseration in which they held it. Adequate comment on it
could only be private, but it could also at least be active, and of rich
and effectual comment Charlotte and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were fortunately alike capable.
Wasn't this consensus literally their only way not to be ungracious? It
was positively as if the measure of their escape from that danger were
given by the growth between them, during their auspicious visit, of an
exquisite sense of complicity.



<p/>XXI

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found himself therefore saying, with gaiety, even to Fanny Assingham,
for their common, concerned glance at Eaton Square, the glance that was
so markedly never, as it might have been, a glance at Portland Place:
<div class="bookquote">``What WOULD our cari sposi have made of it here? what would they, you
know, really?'' (<font color='red'><b>Eaton</b></font>)</div>--which overflow would have been reckless if, already, and
surprisingly perhaps even to himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) had not got used to thinking of
this friend as a person in whom the element of protest had of late been
unmistakably allayed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) exposed himself of course to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) replying:
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, if it would have been so bad for them, how can it be so good for
you?'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--but, quite apart from the small sense the question would have had
at the best, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) appeared already to unite with him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) in confidence and
cheer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) view, as well--or at least a partial one--of the inner
spring of this present comparative humility, which was all consistent
with the retraction he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) had practically seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) make after Mr. Verver's
last dinner. Without diplomatising to do so, with no effort to square
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), none to bribe her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to an attitude for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) would have had no
use in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) if it were not sincere, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) yet felt how he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) both held her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and
moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) by the felicity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) taking pity, all instinctively, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
just discernible depression. By just so much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) guessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt
herself, as the slang was, out of it, out of the crystal current and the
expensive picture, by just so much had his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) friendship charmingly made
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), from hour to hour, for the penalties, as they might have been
grossly called, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mistake. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mistake had only been, after all,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanting to seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) straight; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had let herself in for
being--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had made haste, for that matter, during the very first
half-hour, at tea, to proclaim herself--the sole and single frump of
the party. The scale of everything was so different that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) minor
values, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) quainter graces, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) little local authority, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) humour and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wardrobe alike, for which it was enough elsewhere, among her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bons
amis, that they were hers, dear Fanny Assingham's--these matters and
others would be all, now, as nought: five minutes had sufficed to give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) the fatal pitch. In Cadogan Place she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could always, at the worst,
be picturesque--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) habitually spoke of herself as <div class="bookquote">``local''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to Sloane
Street whereas at Matcham she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) should never be anything but horrible. And
it all would have come, the disaster, from the real refinement, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>),
of the spirit of friendship. To prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wasn't really
watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>)--ground for which would have been too terribly grave--she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) pursuit of pleasure: SO she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) might, precisely,
mark her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) detachment. This was handsome trouble for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) to take--the
Prince could see it all: it wasn't a shade of interference that a
good-natured man would visit on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't even say, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) how frumpy she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) knew herself, how frumpy her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) very maid, odiously
going back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), rubbed it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), night and morning, with unsealed
eyes and lips, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) now knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't then say <div class="bookquote">``Ah, see what
you've done: isn't it rather your own fault?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behaved differently
altogether: eminently distinguished himself--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had
never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so universally distinguished--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yet distinguished her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) obscurity, or in what was worse, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) objective absurdity, and
frankly invested her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) absolute value, surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) with all
the importance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wit. That wit, as discriminated from stature and
complexion, a sense for <div class="bookquote">``bridge''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and a credit for pearls, could have
importance was meanwhile but dimly perceived at Matcham; so that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``niceness''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) called it only niceness, but it brought tears
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) eyes--had the greatness of a general as well as of a special
demonstration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) understands,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, as a comment on all this, to Mrs.
Verver--<div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) understands all she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) needs to understand. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has taken her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
time, but she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has at last made it out for herself: she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sees how all we
can desire is to give them the life they prefer, to surround them with
the peace and quiet, and above all with the sense of security, most
favourable to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) can't of course very well put it to us that
we have, so far as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is concerned, but to make the best of our
circumstances; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) can't say in so many words `Don't think of me, for
I too must make the best of mine: arrange as you can, only, and live as
you must.' I don't get quite THAT from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), any more than I ask for it.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tone and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) whole manner mean nothing at all unless they mean
that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) trusts us to take as watchful, to take as artful, to take as
tender care, in our way, as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) so anxiously takes in hers. So that
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s--well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Verver</b></font>)</div>the Prince wound up, <div class="bookquote">``what you may call practically all
right.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>Charlotte in fact, however, to help out his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) confidence, didn't
call it anything; return as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might to the lucidity, the importance, or
whatever it was, of this lesson, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) no aid toward reading it
aloud. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), two or three times over, spell it out for himself;
only on the eve of their visit's end was she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), for once, clear or direct
in response. They had found a minute together in the great hall of the
house during the half-hour before dinner; this easiest of chances they
had already, a couple of times, arrived at by waiting persistently
till the last other loiterers had gone to dress, and by being prepared
themselves to dress so expeditiously that they might, a little later on,
be among the first to appear in festal array. The hall then was
empty, before the army of rearranging, cushion-patting housemaids were
marshalled in, and there was a place by the forsaken fire, at one end,
where they might imitate, with art, the unpremeditated. Above all, here,
for the snatched instants, they could breathe so near to each other that
the interval was almost engulfed in it, and the intensity both of the
union and the caution became a workable substitute for contact. They
had prolongations of instants that counted as visions of bliss; they had
slow approximations that counted as long caresses. The quality of these
passages, in truth, made the spoken word, and especially the spoken word
about other people, fall below them; so that our young woman's tone had
even now a certain dryness. <div class="bookquote">``It's very good of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), my dear, to trust
us. But what else can she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, whatever people do when they don't trust. Let one see they don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But let whom see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let ME, say, to begin with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And should you mind that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) had a slight show of surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) letting you see? No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte; <div class="bookquote">``the only thing I can imagine
myself minding is what you yourself, if you don't look out, may let HER
see.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>To which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``You may let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) see, you know, that you're
afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm only afraid of you, a little, at moments,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) presently returned.
<div class="bookquote">``But I shan't let Fanny see that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>It was clear, however, that neither the limits nor the extent of
Mrs. Assingham's vision were now a real concern to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) gave
expression to this as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had not even yet done. <div class="bookquote">``What in the world
can she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) do against us? There's not a word that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) can breathe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)'s
helpless; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) can't speak; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would be herself the first to be dished
by it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then as he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) seemed slow to follow: <div class="bookquote">``It all comes back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
It all began with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Everything, from the first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) introduced you to
Maggie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) made your marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince might have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) moment of demur, but at this, after a
little, as with a smile dim but deep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) came on. <div class="bookquote">``Mayn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) also
be said, a good deal, to have made yours? That was intended, I think,
wasn't it? for a kind of rectification.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) side, for an instant, hesitated; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was prompter
still. ``I don't mean there was anything to rectify; everything was as it
had to be, and I'm not speaking of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) may have been concerned for
you and me. I'm speaking of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) took, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) way, each time, THEIR
lives in hand, and how, therefore, that ties her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) up to-day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) can't go
to them and say `It's very awkward of course, you poor dear things, but
I was frivolously mistaken.'''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) took it in still, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) long look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``All the more that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
wasn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was right. Everything's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``and everything
will stay so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then that's all I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) worked it out, for the deeper satisfaction, even to superfluous
lucidity. <div class="bookquote">``We're happy, and they're happy. What more does the position
admit of? What more need Fanny Assingham want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``it's not I who say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) need want
anything. I only say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)'s FIXED, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must stand exactly where
everything has, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own act, placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). It's you who have seemed
haunted with the possibility, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), of some injurious alternative,
something or other we must be prepared for.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) high
reasoning, a strange cold smile. <div class="bookquote">``We ARE prepared--for anything, for
everything; and AS we are, practically, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must take us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)'s
condemned to consistency; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)'s doomed, poor thing, to a genial
optimism. That, luckily for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), however, is very much the law of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was born to soothe and to smooth. Now then, therefore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Verver</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Verver gently laughed, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has the chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) present professions may, even at the best, not be
sincere?--may be but a mask for doubts and fears, and for gaining time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince had looked, with the question, as if this, again, could
trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), and it determined in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) companion a slight impatience.
<div class="bookquote">``You keep talking about such things as if they were our affair at all. I
feel, at any rate, that I've nothing to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doubts and fears, or
with anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) may feel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must arrange all that for herself. It's
enough for me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)'ll always be, of necessity, much more afraid for
herself, REALLY, either to see or to speak, than we should be to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) do it even if we were the idiots and cowards we aren't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>And
Charlotte's face, with these words--to the mitigation of the slightly
hard ring there might otherwise have been in them--fairly lightened,
softened, shone out. It reflected as really never yet the rare felicity
of their luck. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) look for the moment as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had actually
pronounced that word of unpermitted presumption--so apt is the
countenance, as with a finer consciousness than the tongue, to betray a
sense of this particular lapse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might indeed, the next instant, have
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend wince, in advance, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) use of a word that was already
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lips; for it was still unmistakable with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that there were
things he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could prize, forms of fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could cherish, without at
all proportionately liking their names. Had all this, however, been
even completely present to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) companion, what other term could she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
have applied to the strongest and simplest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ideas but the one that
exactly fitted it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) applied it then, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own instinct moved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), at the same time, to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tribute to the good taste from which
they hadn't heretofore by a hair's breadth deviated. <div class="bookquote">``If it didn't sound
so vulgar I should say that we're--fatally, as it were--SAFE. Pardon the
low expression--since it's what we happen to be. We're so because they
are. And they're so because they can't be anything else, from the moment
that, having originally intervened for them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wouldn't now be able to
bear herself if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) didn't keep them so. That's the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)'s inevitably
WITH us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte over her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smile. <div class="bookquote">``We hang, essentially,
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, the Prince candidly allowed she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did bring it home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). Every
way it worked out. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I see. We hang, essentially, together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) friend had a shrug--a shrug that had a grace. <div class="bookquote">``Cosa volete?''  (<font color='red'><b>Roman</b></font>)</div>The
effect, beautifully, nobly, was more than Roman. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, beyond doubt, it's
a case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's a case. There can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``have been
many.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps never, never, never any other. That,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``I confess I
should like to think. Only ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only ours--most probably. Speriamo.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To which, as after hushed
connections, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) presently added: <div class="bookquote">``Poor Fanny!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But Charlotte had
already, with a start and a warning hand, turned from a glance at
the clock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sailed away to dress, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) reach the
staircase. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) eyes followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) till, with a simple swift look round
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) vanished. Something in the sight, however, appeared to have
renewed the spring of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) last exclamation, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) breathed again upon
the air. <div class="bookquote">``Poor, poor Fanny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/>It was to prove, however, on the morrow, quite consistent with the
spirit of these words that, the party at Matcham breaking up and
multitudinously dispersing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) should be able to meet the question of
the social side of the process of repatriation with due presence of
mind. It was impossible, for reasons, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) should travel to town with
the Assinghams; it was impossible, for the same reasons, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>)
should travel to town save in the conditions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) had for the
last twenty-four hours been privately, and it might have been said
profoundly, thinking out. The result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) thought was already precious
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>), and this put at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) service, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) sufficiently believed, the right
tone for disposing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) elder friend's suggestion, an assumption in
fact equally full and mild, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) and Charlotte would conveniently
take the same train and occupy the same compartment as the Colonel and
herself. The extension of the idea to Mrs. Verver had been, precisely,
a part of Mrs. Assingham's mildness, and nothing could better have
characterised her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) sense for social shades than her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) easy perception that
the gentleman from Portland Place and the lady from Eaton Square might
now confess, quite without indiscretion, to simultaneity of movement.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had made, for the four days, no direct appeal to the latter
personage, but the Prince was accidental witness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) taking a fresh
start at the moment the company were about to scatter for the last night
of their stay. There had been, at this climax, the usual preparatory
talk about hours and combinations, in the midst of which poor
Fanny gently approached Mrs. Verver. She (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``You and the Prince,
love,'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--quite, apparently, without blinking; she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) took for granted their
public withdrawal together; she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) remarked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) and Bob were alike
ready, in the interest of sociability, to take any train that would
make them all one party. <div class="bookquote">``I feel really as if, all this time, I had seen
nothing of you'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--that gave an added grace to the candour of the dear
thing's approach. But just then it was, on the other hand, that the
young man found himself borrow most effectively the secret of the right
tone for doing as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) preferred. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) preference had, during the evening,
not failed of occasion to press him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with mute insistences; practically
without words, without any sort of straight telegraphy, it had arrived
at a felt identity with Charlotte's own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spoke all for their friend
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) answered their friend's question, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) none the less
signalled to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as definitely as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had fluttered a white
handkerchief from a window. <div class="bookquote">``It's awfully sweet of you, darling--our
going together would be charming. But you mustn't mind us--you must
suit yourselves we've settled, Amerigo and I, to stay over till after
luncheon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div><p/>Amerigo, with the chink of this gold in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ear, turned straight away,
so as not to be instantly appealed to; and for the very emotion of the
wonder, furthermore, of what divination may achieve when winged by a
community of passion. Charlotte had uttered the exact plea that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
been keeping ready for the same foreseen necessity, and had uttered
it simply as a consequence of their deepening unexpressed need of each
other and without the passing between them of a word. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hadn't, God
knew, to take it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was too conscious of what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wanted; but
the lesson for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was in the straight clear tone that Charlotte could
thus distil, in the perfect felicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) adding no explanation, no
touch for plausibility, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wasn't strictly obliged to add, and
in the truly superior way in which women, so situated, express
and distinguish themselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had answered Mrs. Assingham quite
adequately; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had not spoiled it by a reason a scrap larger than the
smallest that would serve, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had, above all, thrown off, for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
stretched but covered attention, an image that flashed like a mirror
played at the face of the sun. The measure of EVERYTHING, to all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
sense, at these moments, was in it--the measure especially of the
thought that had been growing with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a positive obsession and that
began to throb as never yet under this brush of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) having, by perfect
parity of imagination, the match for it. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) whole consciousness had by
this time begun almost to ache with a truth of an exquisite order,
at the glow of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) too had, so unmistakably then, been warming
herself--the truth that the occasion constituted by the last few days
couldn't possibly, save by some poverty of their own, refuse them some
still other and still greater beauty. It had already told them, with
an hourly voice, that it had a meaning--a meaning that their associated
sense was to drain even as thirsty lips, after the plough through the
sands and the sight, afar, of the palm-cluster, might drink in at last
the promised well in the desert. There had been beauty, day after day,
and there had been, for the spiritual lips, something of the pervasive
taste of it; yet it was all, none the less, as if their response had
remained below their fortune. How to bring it, by some brave, free
lift, up to the same height was the idea with which, behind and beneath
everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was restlessly occupied, and in the exploration of which,
as in that of the sun-chequered greenwood of romance, his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) spirit thus,
at the opening of a vista, met hers. They were already, from that
moment, so hand-in-hand in the place that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) found himself making use,
five minutes later, of exactly the same tone as Charlotte's for telling
Mrs. Assingham that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was likewise, in the matter of the return to
London, sorry for what mightn't be.

<p/>This had become, of a sudden, the simplest thing in the world--the
sense of which moreover seemed really to amount to a portent that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
should feel, forevermore, on the general head, conveniently at his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ease
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went in fact a step further than Charlotte--put the latter
forward as creating his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) necessity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was staying over luncheon to
oblige their hostess--as a consequence of which he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must also stay to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) decently home. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) safe and sound, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) felt, in Eaton
Square. Regret as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might, too, the difference made by this obligation,
he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) frankly didn't mind, inasmuch as, over and above the pleasure itself,
his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) scruple would certainly gratify both Mr. Verver and Maggie.
They never yet had absolutely and entirely learned, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) even found
deliberation to intimate, how little he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) really neglected the first--as
it seemed nowadays quite to have become--of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) domestic duties:
therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) still constantly felt how little he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must remit his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) effort
to make them remark it. To which he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) added with equal lucidity that
they would return in time for dinner, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) didn't, as a last word,
subjoin that it would be <div class="bookquote">``lovely''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of Fanny to find, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own return,
a moment to go to Eaton Square and report them as struggling bravely on,
this was not because the impulse, down to the very name for the amiable
act, altogether failed to rise. His (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) inward assurance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) general plan,
had at moments, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was concerned, its drops of continuity, and
nothing would less have pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should suspect in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>), however tempted, any element of conscious <div class="bookquote">``cheek.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) was
always--that was really the upshot--cultivating thanklessly the
considerate and the delicate: it was a long lesson, this unlearning,
with people of English race, all the little superstitions that accompany
friendship. Mrs. Assingham herself was the first to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) would
unfailingly <div class="bookquote">``report'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) brought it out in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) thought, quite
wonderfully--having attained the summit of the wonderful during the
brief interval that had separated her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) appeal to Charlotte from this
passage with himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had taken the five minutes, obviously, amid
the rest of the talk and the movement, to retire into her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) tent for
meditation--which showed, among several things, the impression Charlotte
had made on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). It was from the tent she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) emerged, as with arms
refurbished; though who indeed could say if the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) now
met him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) spoke most, really, of the glitter of battle or of the white
waver of the flag of truce? The parley was short either way; the
gallantry of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) offer was all sufficient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go to our friends then--I'll ask for luncheon. I'll tell them when
to expect you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be charming. Say we're all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right--precisely. I can't say more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) considered, as for the possible importance of it.
<div class="bookquote">``Neither can you, by what I seem to feel, say less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I WON'T say less!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny laughed; with which, the next moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had turned away. But they had it again, not less bravely, on the
morrow, after breakfast, in the thick of the advancing carriages and the
exchange of farewells. <div class="bookquote">``I think I'll send home my maid from Euston,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was then prepared to amend, <div class="bookquote">``and go to Eaton Square straight. So you can
be easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I think we're easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince returned. <div class="bookquote">``Be sure to say, at any
rate, that we're bearing up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're bearing up--good. And Charlotte returns to dinner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To dinner. We're not likely, I think, to make another night away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, I wish you at least a pleasant day,''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) laughed as they separated, <div class="bookquote">``we shall do our best for
it!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--after which, in due course, with the announcement of their
conveyance, the Assinghams rolled off.



<p/>XXII

<p/>It was quite, for the Prince, after this, as if the view had further
cleared; so that the half-hour during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) strolled on the terrace
and smoked--the day being lovely--overflowed with the plenitude of its
particular quality. Its general brightness was composed, doubtless, of
many elements, but what shone out of it as if the whole place and time
had been a great picture, from the hand of genius, presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) as
a prime ornament for his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) collection and all varnished and framed to
hang up--what marked it especially for the highest appreciation was
his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) extraordinarily unchallenged, his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) absolutely appointed and enhanced
possession of it. Poor Fanny Assingham's challenge amounted to nothing:
one of the things he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) thought of while he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) leaned on the old marble
balustrade--so like others that he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) knew in still more nobly-terraced
Italy--was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was squared, all-conveniently even to herself, and
that, rumbling toward London with this contentment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had become an
image irrelevant to the scene. It further passed across him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>), as
his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) imagination was, for reasons, during the time, unprecedentedly
active,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) had, after all, gained more from women than he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) had ever
lost by them; there appeared so, more and more, on those mystic books
that are kept, in connection with such commerce, even by men of the
loosest business habits, a balance in his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) favour that he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) could pretty
well, as a rule, take for granted. What were they doing at this
very moment, wonderful creatures, but combine and conspire for his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>)
advantage?--from Maggie herself, most wonderful, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way, of all, to
his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) hostess of the present hour, into whose head it had so inevitably
come to keep Charlotte on, for reasons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own, and who had asked,
in this benevolent spirit, why in the world, if not obliged, without
plausibility, to hurry, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's son-in-law should not wait over
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) company. He (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) would at least see, Lady Castledean had said, that
nothing dreadful should happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>), either while still there or
during the exposure of the run to town; and, for that matter, if they
exceeded a little their license it would positively help them to have
done so together. Each of them would, in this way, at home, have the
other comfortably to blame. All of which, besides, in Lady Castledean as
in Maggie, in Fanny Assingham as in Charlotte herself, was working;
for him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) without provocation or pressure, by the mere play of some
vague sense on their part--definite and conscious at the most only in
Charlotte--that he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) was not, as a nature, as a character, as a gentleman,
in fine, below his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) remarkable fortune.

<p/>But there were more things before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) than even these; things that
melted together, almost indistinguishably, to feed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sense of beauty.
If the outlook was in every way spacious--and the towers of three
cathedrals, in different counties, as had been pointed out to
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), gleamed discernibly, like dim silver, in the rich sameness of
tone--didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) somehow the more feel it so because, precisely, Lady
Castledean had kept over a man of her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) own, and that this offered a
certain sweet intelligibility as the note of the day? It made everything
fit; above all it diverted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the extent of keeping up, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lingered and waited, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meditative smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) had detained Charlotte
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wished to detain Mr. Blint, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't detain Mr.
Blint, disposed though he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) clearly was to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), without spreading
over the act some ampler drapery. Castledean had gone up to London; the
place was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) own; she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) had had a fancy for a quiet morning with Mr.
Blint, a sleek, civil, accomplished young man--distinctly younger than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) ladyship--who played and sang delightfully -LRB-played even <div class="bookquote">``bridge''
 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>and sang the English-comic as well as the French-tragic-RRB-, and the
presence--which really meant the absence--of a couple of other friends,
if they were happily chosen, would make everything all right. The Prince
had the sense, all good-humouredly, of being happily chosen, and it was
not spoiled for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) even by another sense that followed in its train
and with which, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) life in England, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had more than once had
reflectively to deal: the state of being reminded how, after all, as
an outsider, a foreigner, and even as a mere representative husband and
son-in-law, he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) was so irrelevant to the working of affairs that he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>)
could be bent on occasion to uses comparatively trivial. No other of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)
guests would have been thus convenient for their hostess; affairs,
of whatever sorts, had claimed, by early trains, every active, easy,
smoothly-working man, each in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way a lubricated item of the great
social, political, administrative engrenage--claimed most of all
Castledean himself, who was so very oddly, given the personage and the
type, rather a large item. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), on the other hand, had an affair, it
was not of that order; it was of the order, verily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been
reduced to as a not quite glorious substitute.

<p/>It marked, however, the feeling of the hour with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that this vision
of being <div class="bookquote">``reduced''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>interfered not at all with the measure of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) actual
ease. It kept before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again, at moments, the so familiar fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sacrifices--down to the idea of the very relinquishment, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's
convenience, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) real situation in the world; with the consequence,
thus, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, in the last analysis, among all these so often
inferior people, practically held cheap and made light of. But though
all this was sensible enough there was a spirit in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that could rise
above it, a spirit that positively played with the facts, with all of
them; from that of the droll ambiguity of English relations to that
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) having in mind something quite beautiful and independent and
harmonious, something wholly his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't somehow take Mr. Blint
seriously--he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) was much more an outsider, by the larger scale, even than
a Roman prince who consented to be in abeyance. Yet it was past finding
out, either, how such a woman as Lady Castledean could take him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)--since
this question but sank for him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) again into the fathomless depths of
English equivocation. He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) knew them all, as was said, <div class="bookquote">``well'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had
lived with them, stayed with them, dined, hunted, shot and done various
other things with them; but the number of questions about them he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)
couldn't have answered had much rather grown than shrunken, so that
experience struck him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) for the most part as having left in him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) but one
residual impression. They didn't like les situations nettes--that was
all he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was very sure of. They wouldn't have them at any price; it had
been their national genius and their national success to avoid them
at every point. They called it themselves, with complacency, their
wonderful spirit of compromise--the very influence of which actually so
hung about him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) here, from moment to moment, that the earth and the air,
the light and the colour, the fields and the hills and the sky, the
blue-green counties and the cold cathedrals, owed to it every accent of
their tone. Verily, as one had to feel in presence of such a picture, it
had succeeded; it had made, up to now, for that seated solidity, in the
rich sea-mist, on which the garish, the supposedly envious, peoples have
ever cooled their eyes. But it was at the same time precisely why even
much initiation left one, at given moments, so puzzled as to the element
of staleness in all the freshness and of freshness in all the staleness,
of innocence in the guilt and of guilt in the innocence. There were
other marble terraces, sweeping more purple prospects, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>peoples</b></font>) would
have known what to think, and would have enjoyed thereby at least
the small intellectual fillip of a discerned relation between a given
appearance and a taken meaning. The inquiring mind, in these present
conditions, might, it was true, be more sharply challenged; but the
result of its attention and its ingenuity, it had unluckily learned to
know, was too often to be confronted with a mere dead wall, a lapse
of logic, a confirmed bewilderment. And moreover, above all,
nothing mattered, in the relation of the enclosing scene to his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) own
consciousness, but its very most direct bearings.

<p/>Lady Castledean's dream of Mr. Blint for the morning was doubtless
already, with all the spacious harmonies re-established, taking the
form of <div class="bookquote">``going over''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blint</b></font>)</div>something with him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>), at the piano, in one of the
numerous smaller rooms that were consecrated to the less gregarious
uses; what she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) had wished had been effected--her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) convenience had
been assured. This made him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>), however, wonder the more where Charlotte
was--since he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) didn't at all suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to be making a tactless third,
which would be to have accepted mere spectatorship, in the duet of their
companions. The upshot of everything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>), alike of the less and of
the more, was that the exquisite day bloomed there like a large fragrant
flower that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) had only to gather. But it was to Charlotte he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) wished
to make the offering, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) moved along the terrace, which rendered
visible parts of two sides of the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) looked up at all the windows
that were open to the April morning, and wondered which of them would
represent his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) friend's room. It befell thus that his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) question, after
no long time, was answered; he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) saw Charlotte appear above as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
been called by the pausing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) feet on the flags. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had come to the
sill, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) leaned to look down, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) remained there a minute
smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) had been immediately struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wearing a hat
and a jacket--which conduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) appearance of readiness not so much
to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>), with a beautiful uncovered head and a parasol, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>)
stood, as to take with him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) some larger step altogether. The larger step
had been, since the evening before, intensely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) own mind, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) had not fully thought out, even yet, the slightly difficult detail of
it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) had had no chance, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) needed, to speak the definite
word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and the face she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) now showed affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>), accordingly, as
a notice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had wonderfully guessed it for herself. They had these
identities of impulse--they had had them repeatedly before; and if such
unarranged but unerring encounters gave the measure of the degree in
which people were, in the common phrase, meant for each other, no union
in the world had ever been more sweetened with rightness. What in fact
most often happened was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) rightness went, as who should say, even
further than his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) own; they were conscious of the same necessity at the
same moment, only it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), as a general thing, who most clearly saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) way to it. Something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) long look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) now out of the old
grey window, something in the very poise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hat, the colour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
necktie, the prolonged stillness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smile, touched into sudden light
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) all the wealth of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) could count on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) hand there, to pluck it, on the open bloom of the day; but what
did the bright minute mean but that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) answering hand was already
intelligently out? So, therefore, while the minute lasted, it passed
between them that their cup was full; which cup their very eyes, holding
it fast, carried and steadied and began, as they tasted it, to praise.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) broke, however, after a moment, the silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It only wants a moon, a mandolin, and a little danger, to be a
serenade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lightly called down, <div class="bookquote">``let it at least have THIS!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) detached a rich white rosebud from its company with another
in the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dress and flung it down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) caught it in
its fall, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) again after she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) place it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>)
buttonhole. <div class="bookquote">``Come down quickly!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) said in an Italian not loud but
deep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vengo, vengo!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as clearly, but more lightly, tossed out; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) the next minute to wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) came along the terrace again, with pauses during which his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) eyes
rested, as they had already often done, on the brave darker wash of
far-away watercolour that represented the most distant of the cathedral
towns. This place, with its great church and its high accessibility,
its towers that distinguishably signalled, its English history, its
appealing type, its acknowledged interest, this place had sounded its
name to him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) half the night through, and its name had become but another
name, the pronounceable and convenient one, for that supreme sense of
things which now throbbed within him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) had kept saying to himself
<div class="bookquote">``Gloucester, Gloucester, Gloucester,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>quite as if the sharpest meaning
of all the years just passed were intensely expressed in it. That
meaning was really that his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) situation remained quite sublimely
consistent with itself, and that they absolutely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) and Charlotte,
stood there together in the very lustre of this truth. Every present
circumstance helped to proclaim it; it was blown into their faces as by
the lips of the morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) knew why, from the first of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) marriage,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) had tried with such patience for such conformity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) knew why he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) had
given up so much and bored himself so much; he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) knew why he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>), at any rate,
had gone in, on the basis of all forms, on the basis of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) having, in
a manner, sold himself, for a situation nette. It had all been just
in order that his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>)--well, what on earth should he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) call it but his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>)
freedom?--should at present be as perfect and rounded and lustrous
as some huge precious pearl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) hadn't struggled nor snatched; he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) was
taking but what had been given him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>); the pearl dropped itself, with its
exquisite quality and rarity, straight into his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) hand. Here, precisely,
it was, incarnate; its size and its value grew as Mrs. Verver appeared,
afar off, in one of the smaller doorways. She (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) came toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) in
silence, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) moved to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>); the great scale of this particular
front, at Matcham, multiplied thus, in the golden morning, the stages of
their meeting and the successions of their consciousness. It wasn't
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had come quite close that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) produced for her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Gloucester,
Gloucester, Gloucester,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Look at it over there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) knew just where to look. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--isn't it one of the best? There are
cloisters or towers or some thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) eyes, which, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) lips
smiled, were almost grave with their depths of acceptance; came back to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Or the tomb of some old king.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must see the old king; we must `do' the cathedral,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``we
must know all about it. If we could but take,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) exhaled, <div class="bookquote">``the full
opportunity!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then while, for all they seemed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>)
sounded again her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) eyes: <div class="bookquote">``I feel the day like a great gold cup that we
must somehow drain together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel it, as you always make me feel everything, just as you do; so
that I know ten miles off how you feel! But do you remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) asked,
<div class="bookquote">``apropos of great gold cups, the beautiful one, the real one, that I
offered you so long ago and that you wouldn't have? Just before your
marriage'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) brought it back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``the gilded crystal bowl in the
little Bloomsbury shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes!'' (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>--but it took, with a slight surprise on the `Prince's part,
some small recollecting. <div class="bookquote">``The treacherous cracked thing you wanted to
palm off on me, and the little swindling Jew who understood Italian and
who backed you up! But I feel this an occasion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) immediately added,
<div class="bookquote">``and I hope you don't mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``that AS an occasion it's also
cracked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They spoke, naturally, more low than loud, overlooked as they were,
though at a respectful distance, by tiers of windows; but it made each
find in the other's voice a taste as of something slowly and deeply
absorbed. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think too much of `cracks,' and aren't you too
afraid of them? I risk the cracks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``and I've often
recalled the bowl and the little swindling Jew, wondering if they've
parted company. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) made,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``a great impression on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you also, no doubt, made a great impression on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), and I dare
say that if you were to go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) you'd find he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) has been keeping
that treasure for you. But as to cracks,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince went on--<div class="bookquote">``what
did you tell me the other day you prettily call them in English?-'rifts
within the lute'?--risk them as much as you like for yourself, but
don't risk them for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) spoke it in all the gaiety of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) just
barely-tremulous serenity. <div class="bookquote">``I go, as you know, by my superstitions. And
that's why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I know where we are. They're every one, to-day,
on our side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Resting on the parapet; toward the great view, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was silent a little,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) saw the next moment that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes were closed. <div class="bookquote">``I go but by one
thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hand was on the sun-warmed stone; so that, turned as they
were away from the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own upon it and covered it. <div class="bookquote">``I go
by YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I go by you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So they remained a moment, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) spoke again with a gesture that
matched. <div class="bookquote">``What is really our great necessity, you know, is to go by my
watch. It's already eleven'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had looked at the time; <div class="bookquote">``so that if we
stop here to luncheon what becomes of our afternoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To this Charlotte's eyes opened straight. <div class="bookquote">``There's not the slightest
need of our stopping here to luncheon. Don't you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``how
I'm ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had taken it in, but there was always more and more of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You mean you've arranged--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's easy to arrange. My maid goes up with my things. You've only to
speak to your man about yours, and they can go together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean we can leave at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) have it all. <div class="bookquote">``One of the carriages, about which I spoke,
will already have come back for us. If your superstitions are on our
side,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``so my arrangements are, and I'll back my support
against yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you had thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wondered, <div class="bookquote">``about Gloucester?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hesitated--but it was only her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) way. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you would think. We
have, thank goodness, these harmonies. They are food for superstition if
you like. It's beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that it should be Gloucester;
`Glo'ster, Glo'ster,' as you say, making it sound like an old song.
However, I'm sure Glo'ster, Glo'ster will be charming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) still added;
<div class="bookquote">``we shall be able easily to lunch there, and, with our luggage and our
servants off our hands, we shall have at least three or four hours. We
can wire,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``from there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ever so quietly she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had brought it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had thought it, all out, and
it had to be as covertly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) appreciation expand. <div class="bookquote">``Then Lady
Castledean--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't dream of our staying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) took it, but thinking yet. <div class="bookquote">``Then what does she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) dream--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of Mr. Blint, poor dear; of Mr. Blint only.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smile for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--for
the Prince himself--was free. <div class="bookquote">``Have I positively to tell you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
doesn't want us? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) only wanted us for the others--to show she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) wasn't
left alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>). Now that that's done, and that they've all gone,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) of course knows for herself--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Knows'?'' the Prince vaguely echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that we like cathedrals; that we inevitably stop to see them, or
go round to take them in, whenever we've a chance; that it's what our
respective families quite expect of us and would be disappointed for
us to fail of. This, as forestieri,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Verver</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Verver pursued, <div class="bookquote">``would be our
pull--if our pull weren't indeed so great all round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could only keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And have you made out the very
train--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The very one. Paddington--the 6.50 `in.' That gives us oceans; we can
dine, at the usual hour, at home; and as Maggie will of course be in
Eaton Square I hereby invite you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) still but looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>); it was a minute before he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much. With pleasure.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in a moment added:
<div class="bookquote">``But the train for Gloucester?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A local one--11.22; with several stops, but doing it a good deal, I
forget how much, within the hour. So that we've time. Only,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``we must employ our time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) roused himself as from the mere momentary spell of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked
again at his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) watch while they moved back to the door through which she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
had advanced. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had also again questions and stops--all as for the
mystery and the charm. <div class="bookquote">``You looked it up--without my having asked you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``I've seen you with Bradshaw! It takes
Anglo-Saxon blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>```Blood'?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) echoed. ``You've that of every race!'' It kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You're terrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could put it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) liked. <div class="bookquote">``I know the name of the inn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two--you'll see. But I've chosen the right one. And I think I
remember the tomb,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the tomb--!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Any tomb would do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But I mean I had been
keeping my idea so cleverly for you, while there you already were with
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had been keeping it `for' me as much as you like. But how do you
make out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``that you were keeping it FROM me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't--now. How shall I ever keep anything--some day when I shall
wish to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, for things I mayn't want to know, I promise you shall find me
stupid.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They had reached their door, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) herself paused to
explain. <div class="bookquote">``These days, yesterday, last night, this morning, I've wanted
everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, it was all right. <div class="bookquote">``You shall have everything.''



 (<font color='red'><b>XXIII Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>XXIII

<p/>Fanny, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) arrival in town, carried out her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) second idea, despatching
the Colonel to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) club for luncheon and packing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) maid into a cab,
for Cadogan Place, with the variety of their effects. The result of this
for each of the pair was a state of occupation so unbroken that the day
practically passed without fresh contact between them. They dined out
together, but it was both in going to their dinner and in coming back
that they appeared, on either side, to have least to communicate.
Fanny was wrapped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts still more closely than in the
lemon-coloured mantle that protected her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bare shoulders, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
husband, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) silence to deal with, showed himself not less disposed
than usual, when so challenged, to hold up, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have said, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
end of it. They had, in general, in these days, longer pauses and more
abrupt transitions; in one of which latter they found themselves, for a
climax, launched at midnight. Mrs. Assingham, rather wearily housed
again, ascended to the first floor, there to sink, overburdened, on the
landing outside the drawing-room, into a great gilded Venetian chair--of
which at first, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) but made, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) brooding face, a sort of
throne of meditation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) would thus have recalled a little, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) so
free orientalism of type, the immemorially speechless Sphinx about at
last to become articulate. The Colonel, not unlike, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) side, some
old pilgrim of the desert camping at the foot of that monument, went, by
way of reconnoissance, into the drawing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) visited, according to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wont, the windows and their fastenings; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) cast round the place the
eye, all at once, of the master and the manager, the commandant and the
rate-payer; then he (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) wife, before whom, for a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>)
stood waiting. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) herself, for a time, continued to wait, only
looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) inscrutably. There was in these minor manoeuvres and
conscious patiences something of a suspension of their old custom of
divergent discussion, that intercourse by misunderstanding which had
grown so clumsy now. This familiar pleasantry seemed to desire to show
it could yield, on occasion, to any clear trouble; though it was also
sensibly, and just incoherently, in the air that no trouble was at
present to be vulgarly recognised as clear.

<p/>There might, for that matter, even have been in Mr. Assingham's face a
mild perception of some finer sense--a sense for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wife's situation,
and the very situation she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was, oddly enough, about to repudiate--that
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had fairly caused to grow in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). But it was a flower to breathe
upon gently, and this was very much what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) finally did. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
needed no telling that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had given herself, all the afternoon, to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
friends in Eaton Square, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doing so would have been but
the prompt result of impressions gathered, in quantities, in brimming
baskets, like the purple grapes of the vintage, at Matcham; a process
surrounded by him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>), while it so unmistakably went on, with abstentions
and discretions that might almost have counted as solemnities. The
solemnities, at the same time, had committed him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) to nothing--to nothing
beyond this confession itself of a consciousness of deep waters. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
been out on these waters, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>), visibly; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) tribute to the fact
had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), even if without a word, well in sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) had
not quitted for an hour, during her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) adventure, the shore of the mystic
lake; he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) had on the contrary stationed himself where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could signal
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) at need. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) need would have arisen if the planks of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bark had
parted--THEN some sort of plunge would have become his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) immediate duty.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) present position, clearly, was that of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in the centre of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sheet of dark water, and of wondering if her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) actual mute gaze at him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>)
didn't perhaps mean that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) planks WERE now parting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) held himself
so ready that it was quite as if the inward man had pulled off coat and
waistcoat. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had plunged, however--that is before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had uttered
a question--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perceived, not without relief, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was making for
land. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) steadily paddle, always a little nearer, and at
last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) boat bump. The bump was distinct, and in fact she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
stepped ashore. <div class="bookquote">``We were all wrong. There's nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing--?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was like giving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand up the bank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Between Charlotte Verver and the Prince. I was uneasy--but I'm
satisfied now. I was in fact quite mistaken. There's nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div>said Bob Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``that that was just what you did
persistently asseverate. You've guaranteed their straightness from the
first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I've never till now guaranteed anything but my own disposition to
worry. I've never till now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny went on gravely from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``had
such a chance to see and to judge. I had it at that place--if I had, in
my infatuation and my folly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) added with expression, <div class="bookquote">``nothing
else. So I did see--I HAVE seen. And now I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) emphasis, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
repeated the word, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat of infallibility, rise
higher. <div class="bookquote">``I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel took it--but took it at first in silence. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean
they've TOLD you--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I mean nothing so absurd. For in the first place I haven't asked
them, and in the second their word in such a matter wouldn't count.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) oddity, <div class="bookquote">``they'd tell US.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) an instant as with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) old impatience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) short
cuts, always across her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) finest flower-beds; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt, none the less,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) irony down. <div class="bookquote">``Then when they've told you, you'll be
perhaps so good as to let me know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) jerked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) chin, testing the growth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) beard with the back
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hand while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with a single eye. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I don't say that
they'd necessarily tell me that they ARE over the traces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll necessarily, whatever happens, hold their tongues, I hope, and
I'm talking of them now as I take them for myself only. THAT'S enough
for me--it's all I have to regard.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With which, after an instant,
<div class="bookquote">``They're wonderful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) husband concurred, <div class="bookquote">``I really think they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd think it still more if you knew. But you don't know--because
you don't see. Their situation'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--this was what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) didn't see--<div class="bookquote">``is too
extraordinary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>```Too'?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was willing to try.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too extraordinary to be believed, I mean, if one didn't see. But just
that, in a way, is what saves them. They take it seriously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) followed at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own pace. <div class="bookquote">``Their situation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The incredible side of it. They make it credible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Credible then--you do say--to YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again for an interval. <div class="bookquote">``They believe in it themselves.
They take it for what it is. And that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``saves them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if what it `is' is just their chance--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's their chance for what I told you when Charlotte first turned up.
It's their chance for the idea that I was then sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) effort to recall. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, your idea, at different
moments, of any one of THEIR ideas!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>This dim procession, visibly,
mustered before him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), and, with the best will in the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could but
watch its immensity. <div class="bookquote">``Are you speaking now of something to which you can
comfortably settle down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again, for a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) only glowered at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I've come back to my
belief, and that I have done so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) asked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, shows that I'm right--for I assure you I had wandered far. Now
I'm at home again, and I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``to stay here.
They're beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Prince and Charlotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Prince and Charlotte. THAT'S how they're so remarkable. And the
beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``is that they're afraid for them. Afraid, I
mean, for the others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For Mr. Verver and Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It did take some following. <div class="bookquote">``Afraid of
what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid of themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Of THEMSELVES? Of Mr. Verver's and Maggie's
selves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham remained patient as well as lucid. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--of SUCH
blindness too. But most of all of their own danger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) turned it over. <div class="bookquote">``That danger BEING the blindness--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That danger being their position. What their position contains--of
all the elements--I needn't at this time of day attempt to tell you. It
contains, luckily--for that's the mercy--everything BUT blindness:
I mean on their part. The blindness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``is primarily her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
husband's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) stood for a moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) WOULD have it straight. <div class="bookquote">``Whose husband's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Verver's,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``The blindness is most of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>). That
they feel--that they see. But it's also his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wife's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose wife's?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) asked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) continued to gloom at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) in a manner at
variance with the comparative cheer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) contention. And then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
only gloomed: <div class="bookquote">``The Prince's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie's own--Maggie's very own,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pursued as for herself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had a pause. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think Maggie so blind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The question isn't of what I think. The question's of the conviction
that guides the Prince and Charlotte--who have better opportunities than
I for judging.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel again wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Are you so very sure their opportunities
are better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife asked, <div class="bookquote">``what is their whole so extraordinary situation,
their extraordinary relation, but an opportunity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear, you have that opportunity--of their extraordinary
situation and relation--as much as they.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With the difference, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) returned with some spirit, <div class="bookquote">``that
neither of those matters are, if you please, mine. I see the boat
they're in, but I'm not, thank God, in it myself. To-day, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Assingham added, <div class="bookquote">``to-day in Eaton Square I did see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) mused over it still. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, many things. More, somehow, than ever
before. It was as if, God help me, I was seeing FOR them--I mean for the
others. It was as if something had happened--I don't know what, except
some effect of these days with them at that place--that had either made
things come out or had cleared my own eyes.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>These eyes indeed of the
poor lady's rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion's, meanwhile, with the lustre not
so much of intenser insight as of a particular portent that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had at
various other times had occasion to recognise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) desired, obviously,
to reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), but it apparently took a couple of large, candid,
gathering, glittering tears to emphasise the fact. They had immediately,
for him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), their usual direct action: she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) must reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was made
to feel, absolutely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) own way. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would adopt it and conform to it
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) should be able to make it out. The only thing was that it
took such incalculable twists and turns. The twist seemed remarkable
for instance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) developed her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) indication of what had come out in the
afternoon. <div class="bookquote">``It was as if I knew better than ever what makes them--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes them?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) fitfully dropped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, makes the Prince and Charlotte take it all as they do. It might
well have been difficult to know HOW to take it; and they may even
say for themselves that they were a long time trying to see. As I say,
to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``it was as if I were suddenly, with a kind of
horrible push, seeing through their eyes.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>On which, as to shake off her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
perversity, Fanny Assingham sprang up. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) remained there, under the
dim illumination, and while the Colonel, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) high, dry, spare
look of <div class="bookquote">``type,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>to which a certain conformity to the whiteness of
inaccessible snows in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) necktie, shirt-front and waistcoat gave a
rigour of accent, waited, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), they might, at the late hour and
in the still house, have been a pair of specious worldly adventurers,
driven for relief, under sudden stress, to some grim midnight reckoning
in an odd corner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) attention moved mechanically over the objects of
ornament disposed too freely on the walls of staircase and landing,
as to which recognition, for the time, had lost both fondness and
compunction. <div class="bookquote">``I can imagine the way it works,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it's so easy
to understand. Yet I don't want to be wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) the next moment broke
out <div class="bookquote">``I don't, I don't want to be wrong!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To make a mistake, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) meant nothing of the sort; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) knew but too well what she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
meant. <div class="bookquote">``I don't make mistakes. But I perpetrate--in thought--crimes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) spoke with all intensity. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a most dreadful person. There are
times when I seem not to mind a bit what I've done, or what I think or
imagine or fear or accept; when I feel that I'd do it again--feel that
I'd do things myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel remarked in the coolness of debate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you had driven me back on my `nature.' Luckily for you you
never have. You've done every thing else, but you've never done that.
But what I really don't a bit want,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) declared, <div class="bookquote">``is to abet them or
to protect them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion turned this over. <div class="bookquote">``What is there to protect them
from?--if, by your now so settled faith, they've done nothing that
justly exposes them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And it in fact half pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``Well, from a sudden scare. From the
alarm, I mean, of what Maggie MAY think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet if your whole idea is that Maggie thinks nothing--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) waited again. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't my `whole' idea. Nothing is my `whole'
idea--for I felt to-day, as I tell you, that there's so much in the
air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, in the air--!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel dryly breathed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what's in the air always HAS--hasn't it?--to come down to the
earth. And Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham continued, <div class="bookquote">``is a very curious little
person. Since I was `in,' this afternoon, for seeing more than I had
ever done--well, I felt THAT too, for some reason, as I hadn't yet felt
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For `some' reason? For what reason?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>And then, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife at first
said nothing: <div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) give any sign? Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in any way different?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s always so different from anyone else in the world that it's hard
to say when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s different from herself. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has made me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Home here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``First to Portland Place--on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father: since she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) does,
once in a while, leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). That was to keep me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a little
longer. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept the carriage and, after tea there, came with me
herself back here. This was also for the same purpose. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went
home, though I had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a message from the Prince that arranged
their movements otherwise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) and Charlotte must have arrived--if they
have arrived--expecting to drive together to Eaton Square and keep
Maggie on to dinner there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has everything there, you know--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has
clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel didn't in fact know, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) gave it his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) apprehension. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,

had it before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was married--and just as the boy has quite a second
nursery there, in which Mrs. Noble, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) comes with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), makes
herself, I assure you, at home. Si bien that if Charlotte, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own
house, so to speak, should wish a friend or two to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
really would be scarce able to put them up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a thrifty entertainer</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a picture into which, as a thrifty entertainer himself, Bob

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie and the child spread so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) considered. <div class="bookquote">``It IS rather rum,''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all I claim'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seemed thankful for the word. <div class="bookquote">``I don't say
it's anything more--but it IS, distinctly, rum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>Which, after an instant, the Colonel took up. ```More'? What more COULD
it be?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It could be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s unhappy, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) funny little
way of consoling herself. For if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were unhappy'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>--Mrs. Assingham had
figured it out--<div class="bookquote">``that's just the way, I'm convinced, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would take. But

of everything, adores her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband as much as ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel at this brooded for a little at large. <div class="bookquote">``Then if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s so
happy, please what's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>It made his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife almost spring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You think then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s secretly
wretched?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) arms in deprecation. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear, I give them up to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it's not sweet of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spoke at present as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) were
frequently sweet. ``You admit that it is `rum.'''

<p/>And this indeed fixed again, for a moment, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) intention. <div class="bookquote">``Has Charlotte
complained of the want of rooms for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, that I know of, a word. It isn't the sort of thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) does. And

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) always you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, `me'! Charlotte and I, nowadays--!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) spoke as of a chapter
closed. <div class="bookquote">``Yet see the justice I still do her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) strikes me, more and
more, as extraordinary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>A deeper shade, at the renewal of the word, had come into the Colonel's
face. <div class="bookquote">``If they're each and all so extraordinary then, isn't that why one
must just resign one's self to wash one's hands of them--to be lost?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) face, however, so met the question as if it were but a flicker of
the old tone that their trouble had now become too real for--her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) charged
eyes so betrayed the condition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) nerves that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) stepped back,
alertly enough, to firmer ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had spoken before in this light
of a plain man's vision, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) must be something more than a plain man
now. <div class="bookquote">``Hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) then, Charlotte, always her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To complain to? She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'d rather die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!'' (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div>--and Bob Assingham's face, at the vision of such extremities,
lengthened for very docility. <div class="bookquote">``Hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) the Prince then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For such matters? Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) doesn't count.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought that was just what--as the basis of our agitation--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) does
do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham, however, had her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) distinction ready. <div class="bookquote">``Not a bit as a
person to bore with complaints. The ground of MY agitation is, exactly,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) never on any pretext bores him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). Not Charlotte!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Verver</b></font>)</div>And in the
imagination of Mrs. Verver's superiority to any such mistake she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) gave,
characteristically, something like a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) head--as marked a
tribute to that lady's general grace, in all the conditions, as the
personage referred to doubtless had ever received.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, only Maggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>With which the Colonel gave a short low gurgle. But
it found his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife again prepared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not only Maggie. A great many people in London--and small
wonder!--bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maggie only worst then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But it was a question that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had promptly
dropped at the returning brush of another, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had shortly
before sown the seed. <div class="bookquote">``You said just now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would by this time be
back with Charlotte `if they HAVE arrived.' You think it then possible
that they really won't have returned?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) companion exhibited to view, for the idea, a sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
responsibility; but this was insufficient, clearly, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from
entertaining it. <div class="bookquote">``I think there's nothing they're not now capable of--in
their so intense good faith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good faith?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) echoed the words, which had in fact something of an
odd ring, critically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Their false position. It comes to the same thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bore down,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) decision, the superficial lack of sequence. <div class="bookquote">``They may very
possibly, for a demonstration--as I see them--not have come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wondered, visibly, at this, how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did see them. <div class="bookquote">``May have bolted
somewhere together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May have stayed over at Matcham itself till tomorrow. May have
wired home, each of them, since Maggie left me. May have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny
Assingham continued, <div class="bookquote">``God knows what!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) went on, suddenly, with more
emotion--which, at the pressure of some spring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) inner vision,
broke out in a wail of distress, imperfectly smothered. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever
they've done I shall never know. Never, never--because I don't want to,
and because nothing will induce me. So they may do as they like.
But I've worked for them ALL''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) uttered this last with another
irrepressible quaver, and the next moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) tears had come, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
had, with the explosion, quitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) husband as if to hide it from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) passed into the dusky drawing-room, where, during his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own prowl,
shortly previous, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had drawn up a blind, so that the light of the
street-lamps came in a little at the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) made for this
window, against which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) head, while the Colonel, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
lengthened face, looked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) for a minute and hesitated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) might
have been wondering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had really done, to what extent, beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
knowledge or his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) conception, in the affairs of these people, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) COULD
have committed herself. But to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) cry, and yet try not to, was,
quickly enough, too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) at other times quite
not try not to, and that had not been so bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) head to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) breast, where, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) gasped,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) let it stay a little--all with a patience that presently stilled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). Yet the effect of this small crisis, oddly enough, was not to close
their colloquy, with the natural result of sending them to bed: what was
between them had opened out further, had somehow, through the sharp
show of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) feeling, taken a positive stride, had entered, as it were,
without more words, the region of the understood, shutting the door
after it and bringing them so still more nearly face to face. They
remained for some minutes looking at it through the dim window which
opened upon the world of human trouble in general and which let the
vague light play here and there upon gilt and crystal and colour, the
florid features, looming dimly, of Fanny's drawing-room. And the beauty
of what thus passed between them, passed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cry of pain, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
burst of tears, with his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wonderment and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) kindness and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) comfort,
with the moments of their silence, above all, which might have
represented their sinking together, hand in hand, for a time, into the
mystic lake where he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had begun, as we have hinted, by seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) paddle
alone--the beauty of it was that they now could really talk better than
before, because the basis had at last, once for all, defined itself.
What was the basis, which Fanny absolutely exacted, but that Charlotte
and the Prince must be saved--so far as consistently speaking of them
as still safe might save them? It did save them, somehow, for Fanny's
troubled mind--for that was the nature of the mind of women. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) conveyed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now, at all events, by refusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) no gentleness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
sufficiently got the tip, and that the tip was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had wanted. This
remained quite clear even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) presently reverted to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) recent passage with Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``I don't altogether see,
you know, what you infer from it, or why you infer anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
so expressed himself it was quite as if in possession of what they had
brought up from the depths.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say more,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>this made his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) companion reply, <div class="bookquote">``than that something

good--to be quiet and natural. It's when one sees people who always ARE
natural making little pale, pathetic, blinking efforts for it--then
it is that one knows something's the matter. I can't describe my

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>It was impressive, Fanny's vision, and the Colonel, as if himself
agitated by it, took another turn of prowling. <div class="bookquote">``To doubt of fidelity--to

as if immediately feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) turned round to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'ll

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, me. I'm the worst. For,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham, now with a harder
exaltation, <div class="bookquote">``I did it all. I recognise that--I accept it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) won't

sudden sharpness. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'ll carry the whole weight of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't any!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny declared with the same rich emphasis. It kept
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) indeed, as by the loss of the thread, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) longer. <div class="bookquote">``Ah,

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) look for a minute as if it perhaps a little too much imputed
a selfishness, a concern, at any cost, for their own surface. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
might have been deciding that their own surface was, after all, what
they had most to consider. <div class="bookquote">``Not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said with dignity, <div class="bookquote">``if we properly

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>This did, however, pull him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``We mayn't even be sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not now--or at least not yet. It's too soon--that is if it isn't very
much too late. This will depend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham went on; <div class="bookquote">``at any rate
we shall see. We might have pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) before--for all the good it would
then have done her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); we might have begun some time ago. Now, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
has begun to live. And the way it comes to me, the way it comes to me--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>But again she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) projected her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) vision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The way it comes to you can scarcely be that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll like it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The way it comes to me is that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will live. The way it comes to me is
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll triumph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said this with so sudden a prophetic flare that it fairly cheered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``Ah then, we must back her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--we mustn't touch her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). We mayn't touch any of them. We must keep
our hands off; we must go on tiptoe. We must simply watch and wait.
And meanwhile,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``we must bear it as we can. That's
where we are--and serves us right. We're in presence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>And so, moving about the room as in communion with shadowy portents, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
left it till he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) questioned again. <div class="bookquote">``In presence of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, of something possibly beautiful. Beautiful as it MAY come off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had paused there before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``You mean she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll get
the Prince back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) hand in quick impatience: the suggestion might have been
almost abject. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't a question of recovery. It won't be a question
of any vulgar struggle. To `get him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) back' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must have lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), and to
have lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must have had him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>With which Fanny shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``What I take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be waking up to is the truth that, all the while,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear--!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the poor Colonel panted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife repeated. And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went on without pity. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
remember what I said to you long ago--that evening, just before their
marriage, when Charlotte had so suddenly turned up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The smile with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) met this appeal was not, it was to be feared,
robust. <div class="bookquote">``What haven't you, love, said in your time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So many things, no doubt, that they make a chance for my having once or

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see.''

(<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) nodded again, almost
cheerfully--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had been keeping the peace with a baby or a
lunatic. <div class="bookquote">``To the very, very wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife's spirit, after its effort of wing, was able to remain
higher. <div class="bookquote">``To what's called Evil--with a very big E: for the first time in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life. To the discovery of it, to the knowledge of it, to the crude

measure. <div class="bookquote">``To the harsh, bewildering brush, the daily chilling breath
of it. Unless indeed'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>--and here Mrs. Assingham noted a limit <div class="bookquote">``unless

simply to the suspicion and the dread. What we shall see is whether that
mere dose of alarm will prove enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) considered. <div class="bookquote">``But enough for what then, dear--if not enough to break
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a shaking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham rather oddly replied. <div class="bookquote">``To

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But isn't it a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel asked, <div class="bookquote">``that they should happen to be

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, `disagreeable'--? They'll have had to be disagreeable--to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Bob Assingham/Bob</b></font>)</div><p/>Bob Assingham was now at the window, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion slowly
revolved; he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had lighted a cigarette, for final patience, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) seemed
vaguely to <div class="bookquote">``time''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) moved to and fro. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had at the same time
to do justice to the lucidity she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had at last attained, and it was
doubtless by way of expression of this teachability that he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
eyes, for a minute, roll, as from the force of feeling, over the upper
dusk of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had thought of the response his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wife's words
ideally implied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Decide to live--ah yes!--for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) child!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had never felt so snubbed, for an

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>And Mrs. Assingham's whole ample, ornamented person irradiated, with
this, the truth that had begun, under so much handling, to glow. <div class="bookquote">``Any

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To `save' him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>)--?''

it, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) husband's very eyes--<div class="bookquote">``will be work cut out!''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>With which, as at the highest conceivable climax, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wound up their
colloquy. <div class="bookquote">``Good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) manner, however--or in the effect, at least,
of this supreme demonstration that had fairly, and by a single touch,
lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) side; so that, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) back to regain
the landing and the staircase, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), before she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had begun to
mount, with the ring of excited perception. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, but, you know, that's
rather jolly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jolly'--?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) turned upon it, again, at the foot of the staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean it's rather charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Charming'--?'' It had still to be their law, a little, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was
tragic when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was comic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean it's rather beautiful. You just said, yourself, it would be.
Only,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pursued promptly, with the impetus of this idea, and as if it
had suddenly touched with light for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) connections hitherto dim--<div class="bookquote">``only
I don't quite see why that very care for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) which has carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to
such other lengths, precisely, as affect one as so `rum,' hasn't also,
by the same stroke, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) notice a little more what has been going
on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there you are! It's the question that I've all along been asking
myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) eyes on the carpet, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) raised them as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) pursued--she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) have it straight. <div class="bookquote">``And it's the question of an

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An idiot--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the idiot that I'VE been, in all sorts of ways--so often, of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what in the world is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the very intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) conscience about him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>)--the very passion

explained <div class="bookquote">``and I admit it to have been as `rum' a way as possible.
But it has been working from a rum start. From the moment the dear

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>With the renewed vision of this fatality, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could give but a
desperate shrug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel sympathetically mused. <div class="bookquote">``That WAS a rum start.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) very response, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) again flung up her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) arms, seemed to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) sense, for a moment, intolerable. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--there I am! I was really at
the bottom of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) declared; <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what possessed me--but I
planned for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I goaded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With which, however, the next moment,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) took herself up. <div class="bookquote">``Or, rather, I DO know what possessed me--for

continued, <div class="bookquote">``couldn't, with a new life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own, give herself up to

went on--<div class="bookquote">``out of the abundance of one's affection and one's sympathy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It all blessedly came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)--when it wasn't all, for the

compunction. <div class="bookquote">``One was no doubt a meddlesome fool; one always IS, to

poor woman, in straighter communion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion's intelligence
at this moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) appeared to feel, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had ever been before, let
him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) have the whole of the burden of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) consciousness. <div class="bookquote">``I always pay for

when not beautifully, and a trifle mysteriously, flitting across them,
and who was a piece of waste and a piece of threatened failure, just as,
for any possible good to the WORLD, Mr. Verver and Maggie were. It
began to come over me, in the watches of the night, that Charlotte was
a person who COULD keep off ravening women--without being one herself,
either, in the vulgar way of the others; and that this service to Mr.
Verver would be a sweet employment for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) future. There was something,
of course, that might have stopped me: you know, you know what I
mean--it looks at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) veritably moaned, <div class="bookquote">``out of your face! But all
I can say is that it didn't; the reason largely being--once I had fallen

her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) accepting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see--I see.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had paused, meeting all the while his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) listening

the desire was visibly strong in him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) side, but with
cooling breath. <div class="bookquote">``One quite understands, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It only, however, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) there sombre. <div class="bookquote">``I naturally see, love, what

possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``you've only to tell me that that knowledge was my reason
for what I did. How, when you do, can I stand up to you? You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
said with an ineffable headshake, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't stand up! I'm down,

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Worse than that Charlotte--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, don't tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``that there COULD have been nothing

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was almost simultaneous. <div class="bookquote">``Extraordinary!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) observes the forms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``FOR the Prince. And with the others,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``With Mr.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) jerked back. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear, I wouldn't say it for the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) none the less pursued, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had married a woman the Prince

the necessity of the effort. For that, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) stared, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife allowed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) time; at the end of which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) simply said: <div class="bookquote">``No!''

he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had time, further, to risk, soothingly, another question. <div class="bookquote">``Are the

abjectly innocent--that IS to be victims of fate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Charlotte and the Prince are abjectly innocent--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) another minute, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rose to the full height. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.
That is they WERE--as much so in their way as the others. There were
beautiful intentions all round. The Prince's and Charlotte's were
beautiful--of THAT I had my faith. They WERE--I'd go to the stake.
Otherwise,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I should have been a wretch. And I've not been a
wretch. I've only been a double-dyed donkey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``what does our muddle make THEM to have been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, too much taken up with considering each other. You may call such
a mistake as that by what ever name you please; it at any rate means,
all round, their case. It illustrates the misfortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Assingham gravely, <div class="bookquote">``of being too, too charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>This was another matter that took some following, but the Colonel again
did his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) best. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, but to whom?--doesn't it rather depend on that? To
whom have the Prince and Charlotte then been too charming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To each other, in the first place--obviously. And then both of them
together to Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wonderingly echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Maggie.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was now crystalline. <div class="bookquote">``By having accepted, from the
first, so guilelessly--yes, so guilelessly, themselves--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) guileless
idea of still having her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, of keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fast, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then isn't one supposed, in common humanity, and if one hasn't
quarrelled with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and one has the means, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side, doesn't
drink or kick up rows--isn't one supposed to keep one's aged parent in
one's life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly--when there aren't particular reasons against it. That there
may be others than his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) getting drunk is exactly the moral of what is
before us. In the first place Mr. Verver isn't aged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel just hung fire--but it came. <div class="bookquote">``Then why the deuce does
he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)--oh, poor dear man!--behave as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) were?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) took a moment to meet it. <div class="bookquote">``How do you know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) behaves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my own love, we see how Charlotte does!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Again, at this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
faltered; but again she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) rose. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, isn't my whole point that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)'s
charming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't it depend a bit on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) regards as charming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) faced the question as if it were flippant, then with a headshake of
dignity she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) brushed it away. <div class="bookquote">``It's Mr. Verver who's really young--it's
Charlotte who's really old. And what I was saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``isn't
affected!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were saying'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) the justice--<div class="bookquote">``that they're all guileless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That they were. Guileless, all, at first--quite extraordinarily. It's
what I mean by their failure to see that the more they took for granted
they could work together the more they were really working apart. For I
repeat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny went on, <div class="bookquote">``that I really believe Charlotte and the Prince
honestly to have made up their minds, originally, that their very esteem
for Mr. Verver--which was serious, as well it might be!--would save
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see.''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>The Colonel inclined himself. <div class="bookquote">``And save HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It comes to the same thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then save Maggie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``to something a little different. For
Maggie has done the most.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``What do you call the most?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) did it originally--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began the vicious circle. For
that--though you make round eyes at my associating her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with `vice'--is
simply what it has been. It's their mutual consideration, all round,
that has made it the bottomless gulf; and they're really so embroiled
but because, in their way, they've been so improbably GOOD.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In their way--yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel grinned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which was, above all, Maggie's way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No flicker of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) ribaldry was
anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) now. <div class="bookquote">``Maggie had in the first place to make up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) having suffered herself to become--poor little dear,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) believed--so intensely married. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had to make up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
husband for taking so much of the time they might otherwise have spent
together to make this reparation to Mr. Verver perfect. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way to
do this, precisely, was by allowing the Prince the use, the enjoyment,
whatever you may call it, of Charlotte to cheer his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) path--by
instalments, as it were--in proportion as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) herself, making sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
father was all right, might be missed from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side. By so much, at the
same time, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham further explained, <div class="bookquote">``by so much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) young stepmother, for this purpose, away from Mr. Verver,
by just so much did this too strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as something again to be made
up for. It has saddled her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), you will easily see, with a positively new
obligation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father, an obligation created and aggravated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
unfortunate, even if quite heroic, little sense of justice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) began
with wanting to show him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marriage could never, under whatever
temptation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own bliss with the Prince, become for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a pretext
for deserting or neglecting HIM. Then that, in its order, entailed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wanting to show the Prince that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) recognised how the other
desire--this wish to remain, intensely, the same passionate little
daughter she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had always been--involved in some degree, and just for the
present, so to speak, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) neglecting and deserting him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). I quite hold,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny with characteristic amplitude parenthesised, <div class="bookquote">``that a person can
mostly feel but one passion--one TENDER passion, that is--at a
time. Only, that doesn't hold good for our primary and instinctive
attachments, the `voice of blood,' such as one's feeling for a parent
or a brother. Those may be intense and yet not prevent other
intensities--as you will recognise, my dear, when you remember how I
continued, tout betement, to adore my mother, whom you didn't adore, for
years after I had begun to adore you. Well, Maggie'' (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) kept it up--<div class="bookquote">``is
in the same situation as I was, PLUS complications from which I was,
thank heaven, exempt: PLUS the complication, above all, of not having in
the least begun with the sense for complications that I should have
had. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew it, at any rate, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) little scruples and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) little
lucidities, which were really so divinely blind--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feverish little
sense of justice, as I say--had brought the two others together as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
grossest misconduct couldn't have done. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knows something or
other has happened--yet hasn't heretofore known what. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has only
piled up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) remedy, poor child--something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has earnestly but
confusedly seen as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) necessary policy; piled it on top of the policy,
on top of the remedy, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at first thought out for herself, and
that would really have needed, since then, so much modification. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
only modification has been the growth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) necessity to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father's wondering if all, in their life in common, MAY be so certainly
for the best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has now as never before to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) unconscious that,
peculiar, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) makes a point of it, as their situation is, there's
anything in it all uncomfortable or disagreeable, anything morally the
least out of the way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has to keep touching it up to make it, each
day, each month, look natural and normal to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); so that--God forgive me
the comparison!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s like an old woman who has taken to `painting' and
who has to lay it on thicker, to carry it off with a greater audacity,
with a greater impudence even, the older she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) grows.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And Fanny stood a
moment captivated with the image she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had thrown off. <div class="bookquote">``I like the idea of
Maggie audacious and impudent--learning to be so to gloss things over.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) even will, yet, I believe--learn it, for that sacred
purpose, consummately, diabolically. For from the moment the dear man
should see it's all rouge--!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) paused, staring at the vision.

<p/>It imparted itself even to Bob. <div class="bookquote">``Then the fun would begin?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>As it but
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hard, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) amended the form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) inquiry.
<div class="bookquote">``You mean that in that case she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) WILL, charming creature, be lost?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was silent a moment more. <div class="bookquote">``As I've told you before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) won't be
lost if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's saved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll see that as salvation enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel took it in. <div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s a little heroine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'s a little heroine. But it's his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) innocence, above all,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham added, <div class="bookquote">``that will pull them through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion, at this, focussed again Mr. Verver's innocence. <div class="bookquote">``It's
awfully quaint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it's awfully quaint! That it's awfully quaint, that the pair
are awfully quaint, quaint with all our dear old quaintness--by which I
don't mean yours and mine, but that of my own sweet countrypeople, from
whom I've so deplorably degenerated--that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham declared,
<div class="bookquote">``was originally the head and front of their appeal to me and of my
interest in them. And of course I shall feel them quainter still,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
rather ruefully subjoined, <div class="bookquote">``before they've done with me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This might be, but it wasn't what most stood in the Colonel's way. <div class="bookquote">``You
believe so in Mr. Verver's innocence after two years of Charlotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) stared. <div class="bookquote">``But the whole point is just that two years of Charlotte are
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) hasn't really--or what you may call undividedly--had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any more than Maggie, by your theory, eh, has `really or undividedly,'
had four of the Prince? It takes all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hasn't had,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel
conceded, <div class="bookquote">``to account for the innocence that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), too, so leaves us
in admiration.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>So far as it might be ribald again she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) let this pass. <div class="bookquote">``It takes a great
many things to account for Maggie. What is definite, at all events, is
that--strange though this be--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) effort for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father has, up to now,
sufficiently succeeded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) makes him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), accept the
tolerably obvious oddity of their relation, all round, for part of
the game. Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) there, protected and amused and, as it were,
exquisitely humbugged--the Principino, in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) delights, always
aiding--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has safely and serenely enough suffered the conditions of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
life to pass for those he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had sublimely projected. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hadn't worked them
out in detail--any more than I had, heaven pity me!--and the queerness
has been, exactly, in the detail. This, for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), is what it was to have
married Charlotte. And they both,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) neatly wound up, ```help.'''

<p/>```Both'--?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that if Maggie, always in the breach, makes it seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) all
so flourishingly to fit, Charlotte does her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) part not less. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) part
is very large. Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny declared, <div class="bookquote">``works like a horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>So there it all was, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) husband looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a minute across it.
<div class="bookquote">``And what does the Prince work like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fixed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in return. <div class="bookquote">``Like a Prince!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Whereupon, breaking short off,
to ascend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) presented her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) highly--decorated back--in
which, in odd places, controlling the complications of its aspect, the
ruby or the garnet, the turquoise and the topaz, gleamed like faint
symbols of the wit that pinned together the satin patches of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
argument.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) positively under the impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
mastery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) subject; yes, as if the real upshot of the drama before
them was but that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had, when it came to the tight places of life--as
life had shrunk for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) now--the most luminous of wives. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) turned off,
in this view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) majestic retreat, the comparatively faint little
electric lamp which had presided over their talk; then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went up as
immediately behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as the billows of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) amber train allowed, making
out how all the clearness they had conquered was even for herself
a relief--how at last the sense of the amplitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) exposition
sustained and floated her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Joining her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), however, on the landing above,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had already touched a metallic point into light, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had done perhaps even more to create than to extinguish in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the germ
of a curiosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a minute longer--there was another plum
in the pie. <div class="bookquote">``What did you mean some minutes ago by his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) not caring for
Charlotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Prince's? By his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) not `really' caring?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) recalled, after a
little, benevolently enough. <div class="bookquote">``I mean that men don't, when it has all
been too easy. That's how, in nine cases out of ten, a woman is treated
who has risked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life. You asked me just now how he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) works,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) added;
<div class="bookquote">``but you might better perhaps have asked me how he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) plays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) made it up. <div class="bookquote">``Like a Prince?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like a Prince. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is, profoundly, a Prince. For that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said with
expression, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)'s--beautifully--a case. They're far rarer, even in the
`highest circles,' than they pretend to be--and that's what makes so
much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) value. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)'s perhaps one of the very last--the last of the
real ones. So it is we must take him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). We must take him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) all round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel considered. <div class="bookquote">``And how must Charlotte--if anything
happens--take him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The question held her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a minute, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) waited, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) put out a grasping hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) arm, in the flesh of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) answer distinctly enough registered. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>),
standing off a little, the firmest, longest, deepest injunction he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had
ever received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Nothing--in spite of everything--WILL happen.
Nothing HAS happened. Nothing IS happening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked a trifle disappointed. <div class="bookquote">``I see. For US.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For us. For whom else?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was to feel indeed how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
to understand it. <div class="bookquote">``We know nothing on earth--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was an undertaking he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
must sign.

<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wrote, as it were, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) name. <div class="bookquote">``We know nothing on earth.''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldiers</b></font>)</div>It was
like the soldiers' watchword at night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're as innocent,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went on in the same way, <div class="bookquote">``as babes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not rather say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``as innocent as they themselves are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for the best of reasons! Because we're much more so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``But how can we be more--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For them? Oh, easily! We can be anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Absolute idiots then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked as if there were something in that. <div class="bookquote">``But won't they know

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) barely hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Charlotte and the Prince think we are--which is

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>BOOK SECOND: THE PRINCESS




<p/>PART FOURTH


<p/>XXV

<p/>It was not till many days had passed that the Princess began to accept
the idea of having done, a little, something she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was not always doing,
or indeed that of having listened to any inward voice that spoke in a
new tone. Yet these instinctive postponements of reflection were the
fruit, positively, of recognitions and perceptions already active; of
the sense, above all, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had made, at a particular hour, made
by the mere touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hand, a difference in the situation so long
present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) as practically unattackable. This situation had been
occupying, for months and months, the very centre of the garden of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
life, but it had reared itself there like some strange, tall tower
of ivory, or perhaps rather some wonderful, beautiful, but outlandish
pagoda, a structure plated with hard, bright porcelain, coloured and
figured and adorned, at the overhanging eaves, with silver bells that
tinkled, ever so charmingly, when stirred by chance airs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had walked
round and round it--that was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) felt; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had carried on her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
existence in the space left her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) for circulation, a space that sometimes
seemed ample and sometimes narrow: looking up, all the while, at the
fair structure that spread itself so amply and rose so high, but never
quite making out, as yet, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) might have entered had she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wished.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had not wished till now--such was the odd case; and what was
doubtless equally odd, besides, was that, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) raised eyes seemed
to distinguish places that must serve, from within, and especially far
aloft, as apertures and outlooks, no door appeared to give access from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) convenient garden level. The great decorated surface had remained
consistently impenetrable and inscrutable. At present, however, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
considering mind, it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had ceased merely to circle and to
scan the elevation, ceased so vaguely, so quite helplessly to stare and
wonder: she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had caught herself distinctly in the act of pausing, then in
that of lingering, and finally in that of stepping unprecedentedly
near. The thing might have been, by the distance at which it kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), a
Mahometan mosque, with which no base heretic could take a liberty; there
so hung about it the vision of one's putting off one's shoes to enter,
and even, verily, of one's paying with one's life if found there as an
interloper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had not, certainly, arrived at the conception of paying
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) life for anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) might do; but it was nevertheless quite
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had sounded with a tap or two one of the rare porcelain
plates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had knocked, in short--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) could scarce have said
whether for admission or for what; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had applied her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hand to a cool
smooth spot and had waited to see what would happen. Something had
happened; it was as if a sound, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) touch, after a little, had
come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) from within; a sound sufficiently suggesting that her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
approach had been noted.

<p/>If this image, however, may represent our young woman's consciousness of
a recent change in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life--a change now but a few days old--it must
at the same time be observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) both sought and found in renewed
circulation, as I have called it, a measure of relief from the idea
of having perhaps to answer for what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had done. The pagoda in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
blooming garden figured the arrangement--how otherwise was it to be
named?--by which, so strikingly, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been able to marry without
breaking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liked to put it, with the past. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had surrendered
herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband without the shadow of a reserve or a condition,
and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not, all the while, given up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father--the least
little inch. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had compassed the high city of seeing the two men
beautifully take to each other, and nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marriage had marked
it as more happy than this fact of its having practically given the
elder, the lonelier, a new friend. What had moreover all the while
enriched the whole aspect of success was that the latter's marriage had
been no more meassurably paid for than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) having taken the
same great step in the same free way had not in the least involved the
relegation of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) daughter. That it was remarkable they should have
been able at once so to separate and so to keep together had never for
a moment, from however far back, been equivocal to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); that it was
remarkable had in fact quite counted, at first and always, and for each
of them equally, as part of their inspiration and their support. There
were plenty of singular things they were NOT enamoured of--flights of
brilliancy, of audacity, of originality, that, speaking at least for the
dear man and herself, were not at all in their line; but they liked to
think they had given their life this unusual extension and this liberal
form, which many families, many couples, and still more many pairs
of couples, would not have found workable. That last truth had been
distinctly brought home to them by the bright testimony, the quite
explicit envy, of most of their friends, who had remarked to them again
and again that they must, on all the showing, to keep on such terms, be
people of the highest amiability--equally including in the praise, of
course, Amerigo and Charlotte. It had given them pleasure--as how should
it not?--to find themselves shed such a glamour; it had certainly,
that is, given pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father and herself, both of them
distinguishably of a nature so slow to presume that they would scarce
have been sure of their triumph without this pretty reflection of it.
So it was that their felicity had fructified; so it was that the ivory
tower, visible and admirable doubtless, from any point of the social
field, had risen stage by stage. Maggie's actual reluctance to ask
herself with proportionate sharpness why she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had ceased to take comfort
in the sight of it represented accordingly a lapse from that ideal
consistency on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) moral comfort almost at any time depended. To
remain consistent she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had always been capable of cutting down more or
less her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) prior term.

<p/>Moving for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life as in the darkening shadow of a
false position, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reflected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should either not have ceased
to be right--that is, to be confident--or have recognised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
wrong; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tried to deal with herself, for a space, only as a
silken-coated spaniel who has scrambled out of a pond and who rattles
the water from his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ears. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) shake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head, again and again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
went, was much of that order, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had the resource, to which, save
for the rude equivalent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) generalising bark, the spaniel would have
been a stranger, of humming to herself hard as a sign that nothing had
happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not, so to speak, fallen in; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had had no
accident and had not got wet; this at any rate was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pretension until
after she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) began a little to wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mightn't, with or without
exposure, have taken cold. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could at all events remember no time at
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had felt so excited, and certainly none--which was another
special point--that so brought with it as well the necessity for
concealing excitement. This birth of a new eagerness became a high
pastime, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) view, precisely by reason of the ingenuity required for
keeping the thing born out of sight. The ingenuity was thus a private
and absorbing exercise, in the light of which, might I so far multiply
my metaphors, I should compare her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to the frightened but clinging young
mother of an unlawful child. The idea that had possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would
be, by our new analogy, the proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) misadventure, but likewise,
all the while, only another sign of a relation that was more to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) than
anything on earth. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had lived long enough to make out for herself
that any deep-seated passion has its pangs as well as its joys, and that
we are made by its aches and its anxieties most richly conscious of it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had never doubted of the force of the feeling that bound her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband; but to become aware, almost suddenly, that it had begun to
vibrate with a violence that had some of the effect of a strain would,
rightly looked at, after all but show that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, like thousands of
women, every day, acting up to the full privilege of passion. Why in the
world shouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), with every right--if, on consideration, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw no
good reason against it? The best reason against it would have been the
possibility of some consequence disagreeable or inconvenient to others--
especially to such others as had never incommoded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by the egotism of
THEIR passions; but if once that danger were duly guarded against the
fulness of one's measure amounted to no more than the equal use of
one's faculties or the proper playing of one's part. It had come to the
Princess, obscurely at first, but little by little more conceivably,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) faculties had not for a good while been concomitantly used; the
case resembled in a manner that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) once-loved dancing, a matter of
remembered steps that had grown vague from her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) ceasing to go to balls.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would go to balls again--that seemed, freely, even crudely, stated,
the remedy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would take out of the deep receptacles in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
had laid them away the various ornaments congruous with the greater
occasions, and of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) store, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) liked to think, was none of
the smallest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would have been easily to be figured for us at this
occupation; dipping, at off moments and quiet hours, in snatched visits
and by draughty candle-light, into her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) rich collections and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
jewels again a little shyly, but all unmistakably, glow. That in fact
may pass as the very picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) semi-smothered agitation, of the
diversion she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) to some extent successfully found in referring her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) crisis,
so far as was possible, to the mere working of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) own needs.

<p/>It must be added, however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would have been at a loss to
determine--and certainly at first--to which order, that of self-control
or that of large expression, the step she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had taken the afternoon of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
husband's return from Matcham with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) companion properly belonged. For
it had been a step, distinctly, on Maggie's part, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) deciding to do
something, just then and there, which would strike Amerigo as unusual,
and this even though her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) departure from custom had merely consisted
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) so arranging that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wouldn't find her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would definitely
expect to do, in Eaton Square. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) would have, strangely enough, as might
seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>), to come back home for it, and there get the impression of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rather pointedly, or at least all impatiently and independently,
awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>). These were small variations and mild manoeuvres, but
they went accompanied on Maggie's part, as we have mentioned, with
an infinite sense of intention. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) watching by his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) fireside for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
husband's return from an absence might superficially have presented
itself as the most natural act in the world, and the only one, into the
bargain, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) would positively have reckoned. It fell by this
circumstance into the order of plain matters, and yet the very aspect
by which it was, in the event, handed over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brooding fancy was
the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done with it all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had designed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
thought to the proof, and the proof had shown its edge; this was what
was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was no longer playing with blunt and idle
tools, with weapons that didn't cut. There passed across her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) vision ten
times a day the gleam of a bare blade, and at this it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) most
shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes, most knew the impulse to cheat herself with motion and
sound. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had merely driven, on a certain Wednesday, to Portland Place,
instead of remaining in Eaton Square, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) privately repeated it
again and again--there had appeared beforehand no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should
have seen the mantle of history flung, by a single sharp sweep, over so
commonplace a deed. That, all the same, was what had happened; it had
been bitten into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind, all in an hour, that nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had ever
done would hereafter, in some way yet to be determined, so count for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--perhaps not even what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done in accepting, in their old
golden Rome, Amerigo's proposal of marriage. And yet, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) little
crouching posture there, that of a timid tigress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had meant nothing
recklessly ultimate, nothing clumsily fundamental; so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) called it
names, the invidious, the grotesque attitude, holding it up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own
ridicule, reducing so far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could the portee of what had followed
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had but wanted to get nearer--nearer to something indeed that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) couldn't, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wouldn't, even to herself, describe; and
the degree of this achieved nearness was what had been in advance
incalculable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) actual multiplication of distractions and
suppressions, whatever it did for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), failed to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) living
over again any chosen minute--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could choose them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could fix
them--of the freshness of relation produced by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) having administered
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband the first surprise to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had ever treated him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
It had been a poor thing, but it had been all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own, and the whole
passage was backwardly there, a great picture hung on the wall of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
daily life, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to make what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would of.

<p/>It fell, for retrospect, into a succession of moments that were
WATCHABLE still; almost in the manner of the different things done
during a scene on the stage, some scene so acted as to have left a great
impression on the tenant of one of the stalls. Several of these moments
stood out beyond the others, and those she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could feel again most, count
again like the firm pearls on a string, had belonged more particularly
to the lapse of time before dinner--dinner which had been so late, quite
at nine o’clock, that evening, thanks to the final lateness of Amerigo's
own advent. These were parts of the experience--though in fact there had
been a good many of them--between which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) impression could continue
sharply to discriminate. Before the subsequent passages, much later on,
it was to be said, the flame of memory turned to an equalising glow,
that of a lamp in some side-chapel in which incense was thick. The
great moment, at any rate, for conscious repossession, was doubtless the
first: the strange little timed silence which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had fully gauged, on
the spot, as altogether beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own intention, but which--for just
how long? should she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ever really know for just how long?--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could
do nothing to break. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was in the smaller drawing-room, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
always <div class="bookquote">``sat,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had, by calculation, dressed for dinner on finally
coming in. It was a wonder how many things she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had calculated in respect
to this small incident--a matter for the importance of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
so quite indefinite a measure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would be late--he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would be very late;
that was the one certainty that seemed to look her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in the face. There
was still also the possibility that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) drove with Charlotte straight
to Eaton Square he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might think it best to remain there even on learning
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had come away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had left no message for him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) on any such chance;
this was another of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) small shades of decision, though the effect of
it might be to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) still longer absent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would
already have dined; he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might stay, with all he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have to tell, just
on purpose to be nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had known him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to stretch the
point, to these beautiful ends, far beyond that; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had more than once
stretched it to the sacrifice of the opportunity of dressing.

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) herself had now avoided any such sacrifice, and had made herself,
during the time at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) disposal, quite inordinately fresh and quite
positively smart, this had probably added, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) waited and waited,
to that very tension of spirit in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was afterwards to find the
image of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) having crouched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) best, quite intensely, by
herself, to banish any such appearance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't help it if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
couldn't read her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pale novel--ah, that, par exemple, was beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)!
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could at least sit by the lamp with the book, sit there with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) newest frock, worn for the first time, sticking out, all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>),
quite stiff and grand; even perhaps a little too stiff and too grand for
a familiar and domestic frock, yet marked none the less, this time,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ventured to hope, by incontestable intrinsic merit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had glanced
repeatedly at the clock, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had refused herself the weak indulgence
of walking up and down, though the act of doing so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew, would make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) feel, on the polished floor, with the rustle and the <div class="bookquote">``hang,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>still
more beautifully bedecked. The difficulty was that it would also make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) feel herself still more sharply in a state; which was exactly what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) proposed not to do. The only drops of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) anxiety had been when her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
thought strayed complacently, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes, to the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gown,
which was in a manner a refuge, a beguilement, especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
able to fix it long enough to wonder if it would at last really satisfy
Charlotte. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had ever been, in respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) clothes, rather timorous
and uncertain; for the last year, above all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had lived in the
light of Charlotte's possible and rather inscrutable judgment of them.
Charlotte's own were simply the most charming and interesting that any
woman had ever put on; there was a kind of poetic justice in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being
at last able, in this particular, thanks to means, thanks quite to
omnipotence, freely to exercise her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) genius. But Maggie would have
described herself as, in these connections, constantly and intimately
<div class="bookquote">``torn'' (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>; conscious on one side of the impossibility of copying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
companion and conscious on the other of the impossibility of sounding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), independently, to the bottom. Yes, it was one of the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
should go down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) grave without having known--how Charlotte, after
all had been said, really thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stepdaughter looked under any
supposedly ingenious personal experiment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had always been lovely
about the stepdaughter's material braveries--had done, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), the
very best with them; but there had ever fitfully danced at the back of
Maggie's head the suspicion that these expressions were mercies, not
judgments, embodying no absolute, but only a relative, frankness. Hadn't
Charlotte, with so perfect a critical vision, if the truth were known,
given her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) up as hopeless--hopeless by a serious standard, and thereby
invented for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a different and inferior one, in which, as the only
thing to be done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) patiently and soothingly abetted her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)? Hadn't
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), in other words, assented in secret despair, perhaps even in secret
irritation, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) being ridiculous?--so that the best now possible
was to wonder, once in a great while, whether one mightn't give her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) the
surprise of something a little less out of the true note than usual.
Something of this kind was the question that Maggie, while the absentees
still delayed, asked of the appearance she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was endeavouring to present;
but with the result, repeatedly again, that it only went and lost itself
in the thick air that had begun more and more to hang, for our young
woman, over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) accumulations of the unanswered. They were THERE, these
accumulations; they were like a roomful of confused objects, never
as yet <div class="bookquote">``sorted,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which for some time now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been passing and
re-passing, along the corridor of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passed it when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could
without opening the door; then, on occasion, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned the key to throw
in a fresh contribution. So it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been getting things out
of the way. They rejoined the rest of the confusion; it was as if they
found their place, by some instinct of affinity, in the heap. They knew,
in short, where to go; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), at present, by a mental act, once
more pushed the door open, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had practically a sense of method and
experience. What she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should never know about Charlotte's thought--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
tossed THAT in. It would find itself in company, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might at last
have been standing there long enough to see it fall into its corner. The
sight moreover would doubtless have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stare, had her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) attention
been more free--the sight of the mass of vain things, congruous,
incongruous, that awaited every addition. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in fact, with
a vague gasp, turn away, and what had further determined this was the
final sharp extinction of the inward scene by the outward. The quite
different door had opened and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband was there.

<p/>It had been as strange as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could consent, afterwards, to think it; it
had been, essentially, what had made the abrupt bend in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) life: he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had come back, had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) from the other house, VISIBLY
uncertain--this was written in the face he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for the first minute showed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). It had been written only for those seconds, and it had appeared to
go, quickly, after they began to talk; but while it lasted it had been
written large, and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't quite know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had expected
of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hadn't expected the least shade of embarrassment.
What had made the embarrassment--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) called it embarrassment so as to be
able to assure herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) put it at the very worst--what had made
the particular look was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thus distinguishably wishing to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
should find her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). Why FIRST--that had, later on, kept coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); the
question dangled there as if it were the key to everything. With the
sense of it on the spot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had felt, overwhelmingly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
significant, that so she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must instantly strike him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and that this had
a kind of violence beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had intended. It was in fact even at
the moment not absent from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) view that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might easily have made an
abject fool of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--at least for the time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had indeed, for just ten
seconds, been afraid of some such turn: the uncertainty in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face had
become so, the next thing, an uncertainty in the very air. Three words
of impatience the least bit loud, some outbreak of <div class="bookquote">``What in the world
are you `up to', and what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>any note of that sort would
instantly have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) low--and this all the more that heaven knew
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hadn't in any manner designed to be high. It was such a trifle, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
small breach with custom, or at any rate with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) natural presumption,
that all magnitude of wonder had already had, before one could deprecate
the shadow of it, the effect of a complication. It had made for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) some
difference that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't measure, this meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at home and alone
instead of elsewhere and with others, and back and back it kept coming
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) that the blankness he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was able to SEE might,
should she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) choose to insist on it, have a meaning--have, as who should
say, an historic value--beyond the importance of momentary expressions
in general. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had naturally had on the spot no ready notion of what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
might want to see; it was enough for a ready notion, not to speak of
a beating heart, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) DID see, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own
drawing-room at the hour when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would most properly be there. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
hadn't in any way challenged her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), it was true, and, after those instants
during which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) now believed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to have been harbouring the impression
of something unusually prepared and pointed in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) attitude and
array, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had advanced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) smiling and smiling, and thus, without
hesitation at the last, had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms. The hesitation
had been at the first, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at present saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had surmounted it
without her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) help. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no help; for if, on the one hand,
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) couldn't speak for hesitation, so on the other--and especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
didn't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) couldn't explain why she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was agitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had known
it all the while down to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) toes, known it in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presence with fresh
intensity, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had uttered but a question it would have pressed
in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the spring of recklessness. It had been strange that the most
natural thing of all to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should have had that appearance; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was more than ever conscious that any appearance she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had would
come round, more or less straight, to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father, whose life was now
so quiet, on the basis accepted for it, that any alteration of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
consciousness even in the possible sense of enlivenment, would make
their precious equilibrium waver. THAT was at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind,
that their equilibrium was everything, and that it was practically
precarious, a matter of a hair's breadth for the loss of the balance. It
was the equilibrium, or at all events her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) conscious fear about it, that
had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mouth; and the same fear was, on either
side, in the silent look she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and Amerigo had exchanged. The happy
balance that demanded this amount of consideration was truly thus, as by
its own confession, a delicate matter; but that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband had also HIS (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
habit of anxiety and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) general caution only brought them, after all,
more closely together. It would have been most beautifully, therefore,
in the name of the equilibrium, and in that of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) joy at their feeling
so exactly the same about it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have spoken if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
permitted the truth on the subject of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) behaviour to ring out--on the
subject of that poor little behaviour which was for the moment so very
limited a case of eccentricity.

<p/>```Why, why' have I made this evening such a point of our not all dining
together? Well, because I've all day been so wanting you alone that I
finally couldn't bear it, and that there didn't seem any great reason
why I should try to. THAT came to me--funny as it may at first sound,
with all the things we've so wonderfully got into the way of bearing
for each other. You've seemed these last days--I don't know what: more
absent than ever before, too absent for us merely to go on so. It's all
very well, and I perfectly see how beautiful it is, all round; but there
comes a day when something snaps, when the full cup, filled to the
very brim, begins to flow over. That's what has happened to my need of
you--the cup, all day, has been too full to carry. So here I am with it,
spilling it over you--and just for the reason that is the reason of my
life. After all, I've scarcely to explain that I'm as much in love with
you now as the first hour; except that there are some hours--which I
know when they come, because they almost frighten me--that show me I'm
even more so. They come of themselves--and, ah, they've been coming!
After all, after all--!'' Some such words as those were what DIDN'T ring
out, yet it was as if even the unuttered sound had been quenched here
in its own quaver. It was where utterance would have broken down by its
very weight if he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had let it get so far. Without that extremity, at the
end of a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had taken in what he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) needed to take--that his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) wife
was TESTIFYING, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) adored and missed and desired him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). ``After all,
after all,'' since she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put it so, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was right. That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had to
respond to; that was what, from the moment that, as has been said, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``saw,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had to treat as the most pertinent thing possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) held
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) close and long, in expression of their personal reunion--this,
obviously, was one way of doing so. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) cheek, tenderly, and
with a deep vague murmur, against her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face, that side of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
was not pressing to his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) breast. That was, not less obviously, another
way, and there were ways enough, in short, for his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) extemporised ease,
for the good humour she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was afterwards to find herself thinking of as
his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) infinite tact. This last was partly, no doubt, because the question
of tact might be felt as having come up at the end of a quarter of
an hour during which he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had liberally talked and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had genially
questioned. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) day, the happy thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
roundabout journey with Charlotte, all their cathedral-hunting
adventure, and how it had turned out rather more of an affair than they
expected. The moral of it was, at any rate, that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was tired, verily,
and must have a bath and dress--to which end she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would kindly excuse him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
for the shortest time possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to remember afterwards something
that had passed between them on this--how he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had looked, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), during
an instant, at the door, before going out, how he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) asking
him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), in hesitation first, then quickly in decision, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
couldn't help him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) by going up with him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had perhaps also for a moment
hesitated, but he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had declined her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) offer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to preserve, as I
say, the memory of the smile with which he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had opined that at that rate
they wouldn't dine till ten o’clock and that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) should go straighter
and faster alone. Such things, as I say, were to come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--they
played, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) full after-sense, like lights on the whole
impression; the subsequent parts of the experience were not to have
blurred their distinctness. One of these subsequent parts, the first,
had been the not inconsiderable length, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) later and more analytic
consciousness, of this second wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's reappearance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
might certainly, with the best will in the world, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gone up with
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), have been more in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) way than not, since people could really,
almost always, hurry better without help than with it. Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could
actually hardly have made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) take more time than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) taking,
though it must indeed be added that there was now in this much-thinking
little person's state of mind no mere crudity of impatience. Something
had happened, rapidly, with the beautiful sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and with the
drop of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fear of having annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by making him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) go to and fro.
Subsidence of the fearsome, for Maggie's spirit, was always, at first,
positive emergence of the sweet, and it was long since anything had been
so sweet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as the particular quality suddenly given by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) present
emotion to the sense of possession.



<p/>XXVI

<p/>Amerigo was away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat there, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) walked there
without him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had, with the difference of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presence in the
house, ceased to keep herself from moving about; but the hour was filled
nevertheless with the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) nearness, and above all with the
effect, strange in an intimacy so established, of an almost renewed
vision of the facts of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) aspect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last but five days
since, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had stood there before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as if restored from some far
country, some long voyage, some combination of dangers or fatigues. This
unquenchable variety in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) interest, what did it mean
but that--reduced to the flatness of mere statement--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was married,
by good fortune, to an altogether dazzling person? That was an old,
old story, but the truth of it shone out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) like the beauty of some
family picture, some mellow portrait of an ancestor, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might
have been looking at, almost in surprise, after a long intermission. The
dazzling person was upstairs and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was down, and there were moreover
the other facts of the selection and decision that this demonstration
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own had required, and of the constant care that the equilibrium
involved; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had, all the same, never felt so absorbingly married,
so abjectly conscious of a master of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fate. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could do what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); in fact what was actually happening was that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was actually
doing it. <div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) REALLY would--only that quantity
itself escaped perhaps, in the brightness of the high harmony, familiar
naming and discussing. It was enough of a recognition for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that,
whatever the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) might desire, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would always absolutely bring
it off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew at this moment, without a question, with the fullest
surrender, how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had brought off, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), by scarce more than a single
allusion, a perfect flutter of tenderness. If he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had come back tired,
tired from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) long day, the exertion had been, literally, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
service and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's. They two had sat at home at peace, the
Principino between them, the complications of life kept down, the bores
sifted out, the large ease of the home preserved, because of the way
the others held the field and braved the weather. Amerigo never
complained--any more than, for that matter, Charlotte did; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
seemed to see to-night as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had never yet quite done that their
business of social representation, conceived as they conceived it,
beyond any conception of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own, and conscientiously carried out, was
an affair of living always in harness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) remembered Fanny Assingham's
old judgment, that friend's description of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father and herself as not
living at all, as not knowing what to do or what might be done for them;
and there came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) with it an echo of the long talk they had
had together, one September day at Fawns, under the trees, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) put
before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) this dictum of Fanny's.

<p/>That occasion might have counted for them--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had already often made
the reflection--as the first step in an existence more intelligently
arranged. It had been an hour from which the chain of causes and
consequences was definitely traceable--so many things, and at the head
of the list her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father's marriage, having appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to flow from
Charlotte's visit to Fawns, and that event itself having flowed from
the memorable talk. But what perhaps most came out in the light of these
concatenations was that it had been, for all the world, as if Charlotte
had been <div class="bookquote">``had in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>as the servants always said of extra help, because
they had thus suffered it to be pointed out to them that if their family
coach lumbered and stuck the fault was in its lacking its complement of
wheels. Having but three, as they might say, it had wanted another, and
what had Charlotte done from the first but begin to act, on the spot,
and ever so smoothly and beautifully, as a fourth? Nothing had been,
immediately, more manifest than the greater grace of the movement of the
vehicle--as to which, for the completeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) image, Maggie was now
supremely to feel how every strain had been lightened for herself. So
far as SHE was one of the wheels she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had but to keep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) place; since
the work was done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt no weight, and it wasn't too much
to acknowledge that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had scarce to turn round. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had a long pause
before the fire during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have been fixing with intensity
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) projected vision, have been conscious even of its taking an absurd,
fantastic shape. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have been watching the family coach pass and
noting that, somehow, Amerigo and Charlotte were pulling it while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father were not so much as pushing. They were seated inside
together, dandling the Principino and holding him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up to the windows, to
see and be seen, like an infant positively royal; so that the exertion
was ALL with the others. Maggie found in this image a repeated
challenge; again and yet again she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) paused before the fire: after which,
each time, in the manner of one for whom a strong light has suddenly
broken, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gave herself to livelier movement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had seen herself at
last, in the picture she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was studying, suddenly jump from the coach;
whereupon, frankly, with the wonder of the sight, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes opened wider
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart stood still for a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked at the person so
acting as if this person were somebody else, waiting with intensity
to see what would follow. The person had taken a decision--which was
evidently because an impulse long gathering had at last felt a
sharpest pressure. Only how was the decision to be applied?--what, in
particular, would the figure in the picture do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
from the middle of the room, under the force of this question, as if
THERE, exactly, were the field of action involved. Then, as the door
opened again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) recognised, whatever the action, the form, at any
rate, of a first opportunity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband had reappeared--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stood
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) refreshed, almost radiant, quite reassuring. Dressed,
anointed, fragrant, ready, above all, for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
over the end of their delay. It was as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) opportunity had depended
on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) look--and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw that it was good. There was still, for the
instant, something in suspense, but it passed more quickly than on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
previous entrance. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was already holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms. It was, for
hours and hours, later on, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had somehow been lifted aloft,
were floated and carried on some warm high tide beneath which stumbling
blocks had sunk out of sight. This came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) being again, for the
time, in the enjoyment of confidence, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knowing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) believed,
what to do. All the next day, and all the next, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) appeared to herself
to know it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had a plan, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rejoiced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) plan: this consisted
of the light that, suddenly breaking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) restless reverie, had
marked the climax of that vigil. It had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as a question--<div class="bookquote">``What
if I've abandoned THEM, you know? What if I've accepted too passively
the funny form of our life?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There would be a process of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own by
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might do differently in respect to Amerigo and Charlotte--a
process quite independent of any process of theirs. Such a solution had
but to rise before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), to charm her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), with its simplicity,
an advantageous simplicity she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been stupid, for so long, not to
have been struck by; and the simplicity meanwhile seemed proved by the
success that had already begun to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had only had herself
to do something to see how immediately it answered. This consciousness
of its having answered with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband was the uplifting, sustaining
wave. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``met''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) so put it to herself; met her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) with an effect
of generosity and of gaiety, in especial, on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) coming back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
ready for dinner, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wore in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) breast as the token of an escape
for them both from something not quite definite, but clearly, much less
good. Even at that moment, in fact, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) plan had begun to work; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
been, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brightly reappeared, in the act of plucking it out of the
heart of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) earnestness--plucking it, in the garden of thought, as if
it had been some full-blown flower that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could present to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on the
spot. Well, it was the flower of participation, and as that, then and
there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) held it out to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), putting straightway into execution the
idea, so needlessly, so absurdly obscured, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) SHARING with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
whatever the enjoyment, the interest, the experience might be--and
sharing also, for that matter, with Charlotte.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had thrown herself, at dinner, into every feature of the recent
adventure of the companions, letting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) see, without reserve, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
wished to hear everything about it, and making Charlotte in particular,
Charlotte's judgment of Matcham, Charlotte's aspect, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) success
there, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) effect traceably produced, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) clothes inimitably worn,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cleverness gracefully displayed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) social utility, in fine,
brilliantly exemplified, the subject of endless inquiry. Maggie's
inquiry was most empathetic, moreover, for the whole happy thought of
the cathedral-hunt, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was so glad they had entertained, and
as to the pleasant results of which, down to the cold beef and
bread-and-cheese, the queer old smell and the dirty table-cloth at the
inn, Amerigo was good-humouredly responsive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) across
the table, more than once, as if touched by the humility of this
welcome offered to impressions at second-hand, the amusements, the
large freedoms only of others--as if recognising in it something fairly
exquisite; and at the end, while they were alone, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had rung
for a servant, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had renewed again his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) condonation of the little
irregularity, such as it was, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had ventured. They had risen
together to come upstairs; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had been talking at the last about some of
the people, at the very last of all about Lady Castledean and Mr. Blint;
after which she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) had once more broken ground on the matter of the <div class="bookquote">``type''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>of Gloucester. It brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) came round the table to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>),
yet another of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) kind conscious stares, one of the looks, visibly
beguiled, but at the same time not invisibly puzzled, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) had
already shown his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) sense of this charming grace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) curiosity. It
was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) might for a moment be going to say:--<div class="bookquote">``You needn't PRETEND,
dearest, quite so hard, needn't think it necessary to care quite so
much!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) stood there before her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) with some such easy
intelligence, some such intimate reassurance, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) lips. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) answer
would have been all ready--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) wasn't in the least pretending; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) hand, with the maintenance, the
real persistence, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) lucid little plan in her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>)
to understand from that very moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) was going to be WITH him (<font color='blue'><b>Blint</b></font>)
again, quite with them, together, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) doubtless hadn't been since
the <div class="bookquote">``funny''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>changes--that was really all one could call them--into
which they had each, as for the sake of the others, too easily and too
obligingly slipped. They had taken too much for granted that their life
together required, as people in London said, a special <div class="bookquote">``form'' (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>--which was
very well so long as the form was kept only for the outside world and
was made no more of among themselves than the pretty mould of an iced
pudding, or something of that sort, into which, to help yourself, you
didn't hesitate to break with the spoon. So much as that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) would, with
an opening, have allowed herself furthermore to observe; she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>)
to understand how her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) scheme embraced Charlotte too; so that if he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>)
had but uttered the acknowledgment she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) judged him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) on the point of
making--the acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) catching at her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) brave little idea for
their case--she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) would have found herself, as distinctly, voluble almost
to eloquence.

<p/>What befell, however, was that even while she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) thus waited she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) felt
herself present at a process taking place rather deeper within him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) than
the occasion, on the whole, appeared to require--a process of weighing
something in the balance, of considering, deciding, dismissing. He (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had
guessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was there with an idea, there in fact by reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
idea; only this, oddly enough, was what at the last stayed his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) words.
She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was helped to these perceptions by his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) now looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) still
harder than he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had yet done--which really brought it to the turn of a
hair, for her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) didn't make sure his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) notion of her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) idea was the
right one. It was the turn of a hair, because he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had possession of
her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) hands and was bending toward her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), ever so kindly, as if to see, to
understand, more, or possibly give more--she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) didn't know which; and that
had the effect of simply putting her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) would have said, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) power. She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) gave up, let her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) idea go, let everything go; her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) one
consciousness was that he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) was taking her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) again into his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) arms. It was
not till afterwards that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) discriminated as to this; felt how the act
operated with him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) instead of the words he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) hadn't uttered--operated, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) view, as probably better than any words, as always better, in fact,
at any time, than anything. Her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) acceptance of it, her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) response to it,
inevitable, foredoomed, came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), later on, as a virtual assent
to the assumption he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had thus made that there was really nothing such
a demonstration didn't anticipate and didn't dispose of, and that the
spring acting within herself moreover might well have been, beyond any
other, the impulse legitimately to provoke it. It made, for any issue,
the third time since his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) return that he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) breast; and
at present, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) side as they left the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
close for their moving into the hall and across it, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) for
their slow return together to the apartments above. He (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had been right,
overwhelmingly right, as to the felicity of his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) tenderness and the
degree of her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) sensibility, but even while she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) felt these things sweep
all others away she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) tasted of a sort of terror of the weakness they
produced in her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>). It was still, for her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had positively
something to do, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) mustn't be weak for this, must much rather
be strong. For many hours after, none the less, she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) remained weak--if
weak it was; though holding fast indeed to the theory of her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) success,
since her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) agitated overture had been, after all, so unmistakably met.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) recovered soon enough on the whole, the sense that this left her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
Charlotte always to deal with--Charlotte who, at any rate, however
SHE might meet overtures, must meet them, at the worst, more or less
differently. Of that inevitability, of such other ranges of response as
were open to Charlotte, Maggie took the measure in approaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), on
the morrow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) return from Matcham, with the same show of desire to
hear all her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) story. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wanted the whole picture from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
wanted it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion, and, promptly, in Eaton Square, whither,
without the Prince, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) repaired, almost ostentatiously, for the
purpose, this purpose only, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) repeatedly back to the
subject, both in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's presence and during several scraps of
independent colloquy. Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father, instinctively, Maggie took the
ground that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wish for interesting echoes would be not less than her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
own--allowing, that is, for everything his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife would already have had
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), for such passages, between them, as might have occurred
since the evening before. Joining them after luncheon, reaching them, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) desire to proceed with the application of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) idea, before they
had quitted the breakfast-room, the scene of their mid-day meal, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
referred, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) parent's presence, to what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have lost by
delay, and expressed the hope that there would be an anecdote or two
left for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to pick up. Charlotte was dressed to go out, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
husband, it appeared, rather positively prepared not to; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had left
the table, but was seated near the fire with two or three of the morning
papers and the residuum of the second and third posts on a stand beside
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--more even than the usual extravagance, as Maggie's glance made
out, of circulars, catalogues, advertisements, announcements of sales,
foreign envelopes and foreign handwritings that were as unmistakable as
foreign clothes. Charlotte, at the window, looking into the side-street
that abutted on the Square, might have been watching for their visitor's
advent before withdrawing; and in the light, strange and coloured, like
that of a painted picture, which fixed the impression for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), objects
took on values not hitherto so fully shown. It was the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
quickened sensibility; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew herself again in presence of a
problem, in need of a solution for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must intensely work: that
consciousness, lately born in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), had been taught the evening before to
accept a temporary lapse, but had quickly enough again, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) getting
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own house and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) walking across half the town--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
come from Portland Place on foot--found breath still in its lungs.

<p/>It exhaled this breath in a sigh, faint and unheard; her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tribute, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stood there before speaking, to realities looming through the golden
mist that had already begun to be scattered. The conditions facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had yielded, for the time, to the golden mist--had considerably melted
away; but there they were again, definite, and it was for the next
quarter of an hour as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could have counted them one by one on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fingers. Sharp to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) above all was the renewed attestation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
father's comprehensive acceptances, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had so long regarded as of
the same quality with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own, but which, so distinctly now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should
have the complication of being obliged to deal with separately. They had
not yet struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as absolutely extraordinary--which had made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
lumping them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own had but so lately
begun to change; though it instantly stood out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) that there
was really no new judgment of them she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should be able to show without
attracting in some degree his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) attention, without perhaps exciting his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
surprise and making thereby, for the situation she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shared with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), some
difference. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was reminded and warned by the concrete image; and for
a minute Charlotte's face, immediately presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
as searching her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own to see the reminder tell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had not less promptly
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stepmother, and then had bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father, from behind,
and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cheek upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); little amenities tantamount heretofore
to an easy change of guard--Charlotte's own frequent, though always
cheerful, term of comparison for this process of transfer. Maggie
figured thus as the relieving sentry, and so smoothly did use and
custom work for them that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mate might even, on this occasion, after
acceptance of the pass-word, have departed without irrelevant and,
in strictness, unsoldierly gossip. This was not, none the less, what
happened; inasmuch as if our young woman had been floated over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) first
impulse to break the existing charm at a stroke, it yet took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) but
an instant to sound, at any risk, the note she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been privately
practising. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had practised it the day before, at dinner, on
Amerigo, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew but the better how to begin for it with Mrs. Verver,
and it immensely helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), for that matter, to be able at once to
speak of the Prince as having done more to quicken than to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
curiosity. Frankly and gaily she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had come to ask--to ask what, in their
unusually prolonged campaign, the two had achieved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had got out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) admitted, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) could, but husbands were never the
persons who answered such questions ideally. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had only made her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) more
curious, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had arrived early, this way, in order to miss as little
as possible of Charlotte's story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wives, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``are always much better reporters--though I
grant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) added for Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``that fathers are not much better than
husbands. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``tells me more than a tenth of what you
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>); so I hope you haven't told him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) everything yet, since in that
case I shall probably have lost the best part of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Maggie went, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
went--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt herself going; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reminded herself of an actress who had
been studying a part and rehearsing it, but who suddenly, on the stage,
before the footlights, had begun to improvise, to speak lines not in the
text. It was this very sense of the stage and the footlights that kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) up, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rise higher: just as it was the sense of action that
logically involved some platform--action quite positively for the
first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life, or, counting in the previous afternoon, for the
second. The platform remained for three or four days thus sensibly under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had all the while, with it, the inspiration of quite
remarkably, of quite heroically improvising. Preparation and practice
had come but a short way; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) part opened out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) invented from
moment to moment what to say and to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had but one rule of art--to
keep within bounds and not lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head; certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might see for
a week how far that would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said to herself, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
excitement, that it was perfectly simple: to bring about a difference,
touch by touch, without letting either of the three, and least of all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, so much as suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hand. If they should suspect they
would want a reason, and the humiliating truth was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wasn't
ready with a reason--not, that is, with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have called a
reasonable one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought of herself, instinctively, beautifully, as
having dealt, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's side and by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) example,
only in reasonable reasons; and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would really have been most
ashamed of would be to produce for HIM, in this line, some inferior
substitute. Unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were in a position to plead, definitely, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was jealous she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should be in no position to plead, decently, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was dissatisfied. This latter condition would be a necessary implication
of the former; without the former behind it it would HAVE to fall to the
ground. So had the case, wonderfully, been arranged for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); there was a
card she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could play, but there was only one, and to play it would be
to end the game. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt herself--as at the small square green table,
between the tall old silver candlesticks and the neatly arranged
counters--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's playmate and partner; and what it constantly came
back to, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind, was that for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to ask a question, to raise a
doubt, to reflect in any degree on the play of the others, would be
to break the charm. The charm she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had to call it, since it kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion so constantly engaged, so perpetually seated and so
contentedly occupied. To say anything at all would be, in fine, to have
to say WHY she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was jealous; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) private hours, but
stare long, with suffused eyes, at that impossibility.

<p/>By the end of a week, the week that had begun, especially, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
morning hour, in Eaton Square, between her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
consciousness of being beautifully treated had become again verily
greater than her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) consciousness of anything else; and I must add,
moreover, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at last found herself rather oddly wondering what
else, as a consciousness, could have been quite so overwhelming.
Charlotte's response to the experiment of being more with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) OUGHT, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) very well knew, to have stamped the experiment with the feeling of
success; so that if the success itself seemed a boon less substantial
than the original image of it, it enjoyed thereby a certain analogy with
our young woman's aftertaste of Amerigo's own determined demonstrations.
Maggie was to have retained, for that matter, more than one aftertaste,
and if I have spoken of the impressions fixed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had,
so insidiously, taken the field, a definite note must be made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
perception, during those moments, of Charlotte's prompt uncertainty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had shown, no doubt--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't not have shown--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had arrived
with an idea; quite exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband, the night
before, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with a sentiment. This analogy in the
two situations was to keep up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) the remembrance of a kinship of
expression in the two faces in respect to which all she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as yet
professed to herself was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had affected them, or at any rate the
sensibility each of them so admirably covered, in the same way. To make
the comparison at all was, for Maggie, to return to it often, to brood
upon it, to extract from it the last dregs of its interest--to play with
it, in short, nervously, vaguely, incessantly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have played
with a medallion containing on either side a cherished little portrait
and suspended round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) neck by a gold chain of a firm fineness that no
effort would ever snap. The miniatures were back to back, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw
them forever face to face, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked from one to the other
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) found in Charlotte's eyes the gleam of the momentary <div class="bookquote">``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
really want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>that had come and gone for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in the Prince's. So again,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw the other light, the light touched into a glow both in Portland
Place and in Eaton Square, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had betrayed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted
no harm--wanted no greater harm of Charlotte, that is, than to take in
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) meant to go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been present at that process
as personally as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might have been present at some other domestic
incident--the hanging of a new picture, say, or the fitting of the
Principino with his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) first little trousers.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) remained present, accordingly, all the week, so charmingly and
systematically did Mrs. Verver now welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) company. Charlotte had
but wanted the hint, and what was it but the hint, after all, that,
during the so subdued but so ineffaceable passage in the breakfast-room,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) take? It had been taken moreover not with resignation,
not with qualifications or reserves, however bland; it had been taken
with avidity, with gratitude, with a grace of gentleness that supplanted
explanations. The very liberality of this accommodation might indeed
have appeared in the event to give its own account of the matter--as if
it had fairly written the Princess down as a person of variations and
had accordingly conformed but to a rule of tact in accepting these
caprices for law. The caprice actually prevailing happened to be that
the advent of one of the ladies anywhere should, till the fit had
changed, become the sign, unfailingly, of the advent of the other; and
it was emblazoned, in rich colour, on the bright face of this period,
that Mrs. Verver only wished to know, on any occasion, what was expected
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), only held herself there for instructions, in order even to
better them if possible. The two young women, while the passage lasted,
became again very much the companions of other days, the days of
Charlotte's prolonged visits to the admiring and bountiful Maggie, the
days when equality of condition for them had been all the result of the
latter's native vagueness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own advantages. The earlier elements
flushed into life again, the frequency, the intimacy, the high pitch of
accompanying expression--appreciation, endearment, confidence; the rarer
charm produced in each by this active contribution to the felicity of
the other: all enhanced, furthermore--enhanced or qualified, who should
say which?--by a new note of diplomacy, almost of anxiety, just sensible
on Charlotte's part in particular; of intensity of observance, in the
matter of appeal and response, in the matter of making sure the Princess
might be disposed or gratified, that resembled an attempt to play again,
with more refinement, at disparity of relation. Charlotte's attitude
had, in short, its moments of flowering into pretty excesses of
civility, self-effacements in the presence of others, sudden little
formalisms of suggestion and recognition, that might have represented
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sense of the duty of not <div class="bookquote">``losing sight''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>of a social distinction.
This impression came out most for Maggie when, in their easier
intervals, they had only themselves to regard, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion's
inveteracy of never passing first, of not sitting till she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was seated,
of not interrupting till she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) appeared to give leave, of not forgetting,
too, familiarly, that in addition to being important she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was also
sensitive, had the effect of throwing over their intercourse a kind
of silver tissue of decorum. It hung there above them like a canopy of
state, a reminder that though the lady-in-waiting was an established
favourite, safe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) position, a little queen, however, good-natured,
was always a little queen and might, with small warning, remember it.

<p/>And yet another of these concomitants of feverish success, all the
while, was the perception that in another quarter too things were
being made easy. Charlotte's alacrity in meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had, in one sense,
operated slightly overmuch as an intervention: it had begun to reabsorb
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) at the very hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) that, to be all
there, as the phrase was, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) likewise only required--as one of the other
phrases was too--the straight tip. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) talk about the
straight tip, in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) moods of amusement at English slang, in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
remarkable displays of assimilative power, power worthy of better causes
and higher inspirations; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had taken it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), at need, in a way
that, certainly in the first glow of relief, had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brief interval
seem large. Then, however, immediately, and even though superficially,
there had declared itself a readjustment of relations to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was,
once more, practically a little sacrificed. <div class="bookquote">``I must do everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had said, <div class="bookquote">``without letting papa see what I do--at least till it's done!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) scarce knew how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) proposed, even for the next few days, to
blind or beguile this participant in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) life. What had in fact promptly
enough happened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) presently recognised, was that if her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stepmother
had beautifully taken possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had virtually been
rather snatched again thereby from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's side, so, on the
other hand, this had, with as little delay, entailed some very charming
assistance for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in Eaton Square. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went home with Charlotte,
from whatever happy demonstration, for the benefit of the world in which
they supposed themselves to live, that there was no smallest reason why
their closer association shouldn't be public and acclaimed--at these
times she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) regularly found that Amerigo had come either to sit with his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>)
father-in-law in the absence of the ladies, or to make, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) side,
precisely some such display of the easy working of the family life as
would represent the equivalent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) excursions with Charlotte. Under
this particular impression it was that everything in Maggie most
melted and went to pieces--every thing, that is, that belonged to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) disposition to challenge the perfection of their common state. It
divided them again, that was true, this particular turn of the tide--cut
them up afresh into pairs and parties; quite as if a sense for the
equilibrium was what, between them all, had most power of insistence;
quite as if Amerigo himself were all the while, at bottom, equally
thinking of it and watching it. But, as against that, he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was making her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father not miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) could have rendered neither of them a more
excellent service. He (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was acting in short on a cue, the cue given him (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>)
by observation; it had been enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) to see the shade of change
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) behaviour; his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) instinct for relations, the most exquisite
conceivable, prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) immediately to meet and match the difference,
to play somehow into its hands. That was what it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) renewedly
felt, to have married a man who was, sublimely, a gentleman; so that,
in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) not wanting to translate ALL their delicacies into the
grossness of discussion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) yet found again and again, in Portland
Place, moments for saying: <div class="bookquote">``If I didn't love you, you know, for
yourself, I should still love you for HIM.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), after
such speeches, as Charlotte looked, in Eaton Square, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) called HER
attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) benevolence: through the dimness of the almost musing
smile that took account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) extravagance, harmless though it might
be, as a tendency to reckon with. <div class="bookquote">``But my poor child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte might
under this pressure have been on the point of replying, <div class="bookquote">``that's the way
nice people ARE, all round--so that why should one be surprised about
it? We're all nice together--as why shouldn't we be? If we hadn't been
we wouldn't have gone far--and I consider that we've gone very far
indeed. Why should you `take on' as if you weren't a perfect dear
yourself, capable of all the sweetest things?--as if you hadn't in fact
grown up in an atmosphere, the atmosphere of all the good things that
I recognised, even of old, as soon as I came near you, and that you've
allowed me now, between you, to make so blessedly my own.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Verver
might in fact have but just failed to make another point, a point
charmingly natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) as a grateful and irreproachable wife. <div class="bookquote">``It
isn't a bit wonderful, I may also remind you, that your husband should
find, when opportunity permits, worse things to do than to go about with
mine. I happen, love, to appreciate my husband--I happen perfectly to
understand that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) acquaintance should be cultivated and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) company
enjoyed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Some such happily-provoked remarks as these, from Charlotte, at the
other house, had been in the air, but we have seen how there was also
in the air, for our young woman, as an emanation from the same source,
a distilled difference of which the very principle was to keep down
objections and retorts. That impression came back--it had its hours of
doing so; and it may interest us on the ground of its having prompted
in Maggie a final reflection, a reflection out of the heart of which a
light flashed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) like a great flower grown in a night. As soon as
this light had spread a little it produced in some quarters a surprising
distinctness, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) of a sudden ask herself why there should have
been even for three days the least obscurity. The perfection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
success, decidedly, was like some strange shore to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been
noiselessly ferried and where, with a start, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) found herself quaking
at the thought that the boat might have put off again and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).
The word for it, the word that flashed the light, was that they were
TREATING her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), that they were proceeding with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--and, for that matter,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father--by a plan that was the exact counterpart of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own.
It was not from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that they took their cue, but--and this was what
in particular made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sit up--from each other; and with a depth of
unanimity, an exact coincidence of inspiration that, when once her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
attention had begun to fix it, struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as staring out at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in
recovered identities of behaviour, expression and tone. They had a view
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) situation, and of the possible forms her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own consciousness of it
might take--a view determined by the change of attitude they had had,
ever so subtly, to recognise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) on their return from Matcham. They
had had to read into this small and all-but-suppressed variation a mute
comment--on they didn't quite know what; and it now arched over the
Princess's head like a vault of bold span that important communication
between them on the subject couldn't have failed of being immediate.
This new perception bristled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), as we have said, with odd
intimations, but questions unanswered played in and out of it as
well--the question, for instance, of why such promptitude of harmony
SHOULD have been important. Ah, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) began to recover, piece by
piece, the process became lively; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) might have been picking small
shining diamonds out of the sweepings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) ordered house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) bent,
in this pursuit, over her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) dust-bin; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) challenged to the last grain the
refuse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) innocent economy. Then it was that the dismissed vision of
Amerigo, that evening, in arrest at the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) salottino while her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
eyes, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) placed chair, took him (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) in--then it was that this immense
little memory gave out its full power. Since the question was of doors,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) now saw, shut it out; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had responsibly shut
in, as we have understood, shut in there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) sentient self, only
the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) reappearance and the plenitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) presence. These
things had been testimony, after all, to supersede any other, for on the
spot, even while she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) looked, the warmly-washing wave had travelled far
up the strand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had subsequently lived, for hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) couldn't count,
under the dizzying, smothering welter positively in submarine
depths where everything came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) through walls of emerald and
mother-of-pearl; though indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had got her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) head above them, for
breath, when face to face with Charlotte again, on the morrow, in Eaton
Square. Meanwhile, none the less, as was so apparent, the prior, the
prime impression had remained, in the manner of a spying servant, on the
other side of the barred threshold; a witness availing himself, in time,
of the lightest pretext to re-enter. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had found this
pretext in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) observed necessity of comparing--comparing the obvious
common elements in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stepmother's ways of now
<div class="bookquote">``taking''  (<font color='red'><b>stepmother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). With or without her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) witness, at any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was led by
comparison to a sense of the quantity of earnest intention operating,
and operating so harmoniously, between her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companions; and it was in
the mitigated midnight of these approximations that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had made out the
promise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dawn.

<p/>It was a worked-out scheme for their not wounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), for their
behaving to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) quite nobly; to which each had, in some winning way,
induced the other to contribute, and which therefore, so far as that
went, proved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had become with them a subject of intimate study.
Quickly, quickly, on a certain alarm taken, eagerly and anxiously,
before they SHOULD, without knowing it, wound her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), they had signalled
from house to house their clever idea, the idea by which, for all these
days, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own idea had been profiting. They had built her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in with their
purpose--which was why, above her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), a vault seemed more heavily to arch;
so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sat there, in the solid chamber of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) helplessness, as in
a bath of benevolence artfully prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), over the brim of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could but just manage to see by stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) neck. Baths of
benevolence were very well, but, at least, unless one were a patient of
some sort, a nervous eccentric or a lost child, one was usually not
so immersed save by one's request. It wasn't in the least what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had requested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had flapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) little wings as a symbol of desired
flight, not merely as a plea for a more gilded cage and an extra
allowance of lumps of sugar. Above all she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hadn't complained, not by the
quaver of a syllable--so what wound in particular had she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fear
of receiving? What wound HAD she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) received--as to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had exchanged
the least word with them? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had ever whined or moped they might
have had some reason; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would be hanged--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) conversed with
herself in strong language--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been, from beginning to end,
anything but pliable and mild. It all came back, in consequence, to some
required process of their own, a process operating, quite positively,
as a precaution and a policy. They had got her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) into the bath and, for
consistency with themselves--which was with each other--must keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
there. In that condition she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wouldn't interfere with the policy, which
was established, which was arranged. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thought, over this, arrived at
a great intensity--had indeed its pauses and timidities, but always to
take afterwards a further and lighter spring. The ground was well-nigh
covered by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had made out her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) colleague as
directly interested in preventing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) freedom of movement. Policy or no
policy, it was they themselves who were arranged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must be kept in
position so as not to DISarrange them. It fitted immensely together, the
whole thing, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could give them a motive; for, strangely
as it had by this time begun to appear to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had hitherto not
imagined them sustained by an ideal distinguishably different from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
own. Of course they were arranged--all four arranged; but what had
the basis of their life been, precisely, but that they were arranged
together? Amerigo and Charlotte were arranged together, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--to
confine the matter only to herself--was arranged apart. It rushed over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), the full sense of all this, with quite another rush from that of
the breaking wave of ten days before; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father himself seemed
not to meet the vaguely-clutching hand with which, during the first
shock of complete perception, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tried to steady herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt very
much alone.


<p/>XXVII

<p/>There had been, from far back--that is from the Christmas time on--a
plan that the parent and the child should <div class="bookquote">``do something lovely''
 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>together, and they had recurred to it on occasion, nursed it and brought
it up theoretically, though without as yet quite allowing it to put its
feet to the ground. The most it had done was to try a few steps on the
drawing-room carpet, with much attendance, on either side, much holding
up and guarding, much anticipation, in fine, of awkwardness or accident.
Their companions, by the same token, had constantly assisted at the
performance, following the experiment with sympathy and gaiety, and
never so full of applause, Maggie now made out for herself, as when the
infant project had kicked its little legs most wildly--kicked them, for
all the world, across the Channel and half the Continent, kicked them
over the Pyrenees and innocently crowed out some rich Spanish name. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
asked herself at present if it had been a <div class="bookquote">``real''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>belief that they were
but wanting, for some such adventure, to snatch their moment; whether
either had at any instant seen it as workable, save in the form of a toy
to dangle before the other, that they should take flight, without
wife or husband, for one more look, <div class="bookquote">``before they died,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>at the Madrid
pictures as well as for a drop of further weak delay in respect to three
or four possible prizes, privately offered, rarities of the first water,
responsibly reported on and profusely photographed, still patiently
awaiting their noiseless arrival in retreats to which the clue had not
otherwise been given away. The vision dallied with during the duskier
days in Eaton Square had stretched to the span of three or four weeks
of springtime for the total adventure, three or four weeks in the very
spirit, after all, of their regular life, as their regular life had
been persisting; full of shared mornings, afternoons, evenings, walks,
drives, <div class="bookquote">``looks-in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eaton</b></font>)</div>at old places, on vague chances; full also, in
especial, of that purchased social ease, the sense of the comfort and
credit of their house, which had essentially the perfection of something
paid for, but which <div class="bookquote">``came,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eaton</b></font>)</div>on the whole, so cheap that it might have
been felt as costing--as costing the parent and child--nothing. It was
for Maggie to wonder, at present, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been sincere about their
going, to ask herself whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have stuck to their plan even if
nothing had happened.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) view of the impossibility of sticking to it now may give us the
measure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sense that everything had happened. A difference had been
made in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) relation to each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companions, and what it compelled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to say to herself was that to behave as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have behaved
before would be to act, for Amerigo and Charlotte, with the highest
hypocrisy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) saw in these days that a journey abroad with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father
would, more than anything else, have amounted, on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) part and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own,
to a last expression of an ecstasy of confidence, and that the charm of
the idea, in fact, had been in some such sublimity. Day after day
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) put off the moment of <div class="bookquote">``speaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) inwardly and very
comprehensively, called it--speaking, that is, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father; and all
the more that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was ridden by a strange suspense as to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) himself
breaking silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) time, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), during several days, that
morning, that noon, that night, and the next and the next and the next;
even made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mind that if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stood off longer it would be proof
conclusive that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too wasn't at peace. They would then have been, all
successfully, throwing dust in each other's eyes; and it would be at
last as if they must turn away their faces, since the silver mist that
protected them had begun to grow sensibly thin. Finally, at the end of
April, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) decided that if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should say nothing for another period of
twenty-four hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must take it as showing that they were, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
private phraseology, lost; so little possible sincerity could there be
in pretending to care for a journey to Spain at the approach of a summer
that already promised to be hot. Such a proposal, on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lips, such an
extravagance of optimism, would be HIS (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way of being consistent--for that
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't really want to move, or to move further, at the worst, than
back to Fawns again, could only signify that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wasn't, at heart,
contented. What he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wanted, at any rate, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't want were, in
the event, put to the proof for Maggie just in time to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a fresh
wind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been dining, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband, in Eaton Square, on the
occasion of hospitality offered by Mr. and Mrs. Verver to Lord and Lady
Castledean. The propriety of some demonstration of this sort had been
for many days before our group, the question reduced to the mere issue
of which of the two houses should first take the field. The issue had
been easily settled--in the manner of every issue referred in any degree
to Amerigo and Charlotte: the initiative obviously belonged to Mrs.
Verver, who had gone to Matcham while Maggie had stayed away, and the
evening in Eaton Square might have passed for a demonstration all the
more personal that the dinner had been planned on <div class="bookquote">``intimate''  (<font color='red'><b>Eaton</b></font>)</div>lines. Six
other guests only, in addition to the host and the hostess of Matcham,
made up the company, and each of these persons had for Maggie the
interest of an attested connection with the Easter revels at that
visionary house. Their common memory of an occasion that had clearly
left behind it an ineffaceable charm--this air of beatific reference,
less subdued in the others than in Amerigo and Charlotte, lent them,
together, an inscrutable comradeship against which the young woman's
imagination broke in a small vain wave.

<p/>It wasn't that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been of the remembered party and
possessed herself of its secrets; for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't care about its
secrets--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could concern herself at present, absolutely, with no
secret but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own. What occurred was simply that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) became aware, at a
stroke, of the quantity of further nourishment required by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own, and
of the amount of it she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might somehow extract from these people; whereby
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rose, of a sudden, to the desire to possess and use them, even to
the extent of braving, of fairly defying, of directly exploiting, of
possibly quite enjoying, under cover of an evil duplicity, the felt
element of curiosity with which they regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Once she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
conscious of the flitting wing of this last impression--the perception,
irresistible, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was something for their queer experience, just as
they were something for hers--there was no limit to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conceived design
of not letting them escape. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went and went, again, to-night, after
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) start was taken; went, positively, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had felt herself going,
three weeks before, on the morning when the vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father and
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) together in the breakfast-room had been so
determinant. In this other scene it was Lady Castledean who was
determinant, who kindled the light, or at all events the heat, and who
acted on the nerves; Lady Castledean whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>), so oddly, didn't
like, in spite of reasons upon reasons, the biggest diamonds on the
yellowest hair, the longest lashes on the prettiest, falsest eyes,
the oldest lace on the most violet velvet, the rightest manner on the
wrongest assumption. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) ladyship's assumption was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) kept, at
every moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) life, every advantage--it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) beautifully soft,
very nearly generous; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) didn't distinguish the little protuberant
eyes of smaller social insects, often endowed with such a range, from
the other decorative spots on their bodies and wings. Maggie had liked,
in London, and in the world at large, so many more people than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had thought it right to fear, right even to so much as judge, that it
positively quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fever to have to recognise, in this case, such
a lapse of all the sequences. It was only that a charming clever woman
wondered about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--that is wondered about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as Amerigo's wife, and
wondered, moreover, with the intention of kindness and the spontaneity,
almost, of surprise.

<p/>The point of view--that one--was what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) read in their free
contemplation, in that of the whole eight; there was something in
Amerigo to be explained, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was passed about, all tenderly
and expertly, like a dressed doll held, in the right manner, by its
firmly-stuffed middle, for the account she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could give. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have
been made to give it by pressure of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stomach; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have been
expected to articulate, with a rare imitation of nature, <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I'm
HERE all the while; I'm also in my way a solid little fact and I cost
originally a great deal of money: cost, that is, my father, for
my outfit, and let in my husband for an amount of pains--toward my
training--that money would scarce represent.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) WOULD meet them
in some such way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) translated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) idea into action, after dinner,
before they dispersed, by engaging them all, unconventionally, almost
violently, to dine with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in Portland Place, just as they were, if
they didn't mind the same party, which was the party she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted. Oh she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was going, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could feel it afresh; it was a good deal
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had sneezed ten times or had suddenly burst into a comic song.
There were breaks in the connection, as there would be hitches in the
process; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't wholly see, yet, what they would do for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), nor
quite how, herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should handle them; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dancing up and
down, beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) propriety, with the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had at least
begun something--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so fairly liked to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a point for
convergence of wonder. It wasn't after all, either, that THEIR wonder so
much signified--that of the cornered six, whom it glimmered before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might still live to drive about like a flock of sheep: the
intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) consciousness, its sharpest savour, was in the theory
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) having diverted, having, as they said, captured the attention
of Amerigo and Charlotte, at neither of whom, all the while, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
so much as once look. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had pitched them in with the six, for that
matter, so far as they themselves were concerned; they had dropped, for
the succession of minutes, out of contact with their function--had, in
short, startled and impressed, abandoned their post. <div class="bookquote">``They're paralysed,
they're paralysed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) commented, deep within; so much it helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
own apprehension to hang together that they should suddenly lose their
bearings.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) grasp of appearances was thus out of proportion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) view of
causes; but it came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) then and there that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could only get the
facts of appearance straight, only jam them down into their place, the
reasons lurking behind them, kept uncertain, for the eyes, by their
wavering and shifting, wouldn't perhaps be able to help showing. It
wasn't of course that the Prince and Mrs. Verver marvelled to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
civil to their friends; it was rather, precisely, that civil was just
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wasn't: she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had so departed from any such custom of delicate
approach--approach by the permitted note, the suggested <div class="bookquote">``if,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the
accepted vagueness--as would enable the people in question to put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) off if they wished. And the profit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) plan, the effect of the
violence she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was willing to let it go for, was exactly in their BEING
the people in question, people she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had seemed to be rather shy of before
and for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) suddenly opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) mouth so wide. Later on, we may
add, with the ground soon covered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) agitated but resolute step, it
was to cease to matter what people they were or weren't; but meanwhile
the particular sense of them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had taken home to-night had done
her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) the service of seeming to break the ice where that formation was
thickest. Still more unexpectedly, the service might have been the same
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) father; inasmuch as, immediately, when everyone had gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did
exactly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had been waiting for and despairing of--and did it, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did everything, with a simplicity that left any purpose of sounding
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) deeper, of drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out further, of going, in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own frequent
phrase, <div class="bookquote">``behind''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, nothing whatever to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brought it out
straight, made it bravely and beautifully irrelevant, save for the plea
of what they should lose by breaking the charm: <div class="bookquote">``I guess we won't go
down there after all, will we, Mag?--just when it's getting so pleasant
here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>That was all, with nothing to lead up to it; but it was done
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) at a stroke, and done, not less, more rather, for Amerigo and
Charlotte, on whom the immediate effect, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) secretly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) almost
breathlessly measured it, was prodigious. Everything now so fitted for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to everything else that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could feel the effect as prodigious even
while sticking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) policy of giving the pair no look. There were thus
some five wonderful minutes during which they loomed, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sightless
eyes, on either side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), larger than they had ever loomed before,
larger than life, larger than thought, larger than any danger or any
safety. There was thus a space of time, in fine, fairly vertiginous for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) took no more account of them than if they were not
in the room.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had never, never treated them in any such way--not even just now,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had plied her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) art upon the Matcham band; her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) present manner was
an intenser exclusion, and the air was charged with their silence while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) other companion as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had nothing but him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to
consider. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) the note amazingly, by his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) allusion to the
pleasantness--that of such an occasion as his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) successful dinner--which
might figure as their bribe for renouncing; so that it was all as if
they were speaking selfishly, counting on a repetition of just such
extensions of experience. Maggie achieved accordingly an act of
unprecedented energy, threw herself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's presence as by the
absolute consistency with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes; saying to herself,
at the same time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) smiled and talked and inaugurated her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) system,
<div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mean by it? That's the question--what does he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but studying again all the signs in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that recent anxiety had made
familiar and counting the stricken minutes on the part of the others. It
was in their silence that the others loomed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had had
no measure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) afterwards knew, of this duration, but it drew out
and out--really to what would have been called in simpler conditions
awkwardness--as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) herself were stretching the cord. Ten minutes
later, however, in the homeward carriage, to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband, cutting
delay short, had proceeded at the first announcement, ten minutes later
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was to stretch it almost to breaking. The Prince had permitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
to linger much less, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) move to the door, than they usually
lingered at the gossiping close of such evenings; which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), all
responsive, took for a sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) impatience to modify for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the
odd effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) not having, and of Charlotte's not having, instantly
acclaimed the issue of the question debated, or more exactly, settled,
before them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had had time to become aware of this possible impression
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) virtually urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) into the carriage was connected
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) must take action on the new ground. A certain
ambiguity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would absolutely have tormented him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had already
found something to soothe and correct--as to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) side,
a shrewd notion of what it would be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was herself, for that matter,
prepared, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was, of a truth, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) seat in the brougham,
amazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) preparation. It allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) scarce an interval; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
brought it straight out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was certain that was what father would say if I should leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
alone. I HAVE been leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) alone, and you see the effect. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
hates now to move--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) likes too much to be with us. But if you see the
effect'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt herself magnificently keeping it up--<div class="bookquote">``perhaps you
don't see the cause. The cause, my dear, is too lovely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband, on taking his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) place beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), had, during a minute or
two, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) watching sense, neither said nor done anything; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
been, for that sense, as if thinking, waiting, deciding: yet it was
still before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt it to be, definitely
acted. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) close--indulged in the
demonstration, the long, firm embrace by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) single arm, the infinite
pressure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) whole person to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own, that such opportunities had so
often suggested and prescribed. Held, accordingly, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could but
too intimately feel, exquisitely solicited, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had said the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
was intending and desiring to say, and as to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt, even more
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt anything else, that whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might do she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mustn't be
irresponsible. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) exerted grasp, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew what
that was; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was at the same time in the grasp of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) conceived
responsibility, and the extraordinary thing was that, of the two
intensities, the second was presently to become the sharper. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
time for it meanwhile, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) speech after a fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The cause of your father's deciding not to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and of my having wanted to let it act for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quietly--I mean
without my insistence.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) compressed state, another pause,
and it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) feel as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) were immensely resisting. Strange enough
was this sense for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and altogether new, the sense of possessing, by
miraculous help, some advantage that, absolutely then and there, in the
carriage, as they rolled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might either give up or keep. Strange,
inexpressibly strange--so distinctly she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) saw that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did give it up
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should somehow give up everything for ever. And what her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's
grasp really meant, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) very bones registered, was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) SHOULD
give it up: it was exactly for this that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had resorted to unfailing
magic. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) KNEW HOW to resort to it--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could be, on occasion, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
lately more than ever learned, so munificent a lover: all of which was,
precisely, a part of the character she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had never ceased to regard in
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) as princely, a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) large and beautiful ease, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) genius for
charm, for intercourse, for expression, for life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should have but
to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) head back on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) shoulder with a certain movement to make it
definite for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't resist. To this, as they went, every
throb of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) consciousness prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--every throb, that is, but one,
the throb of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) deeper need to know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``really''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was. By the time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had uttered the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) idea, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was still keeping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) head and intending to keep it; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was also staring out of
the carriage-window with eyes into which the tears of suffered pain had
risen, indistinguishable, perhaps, happily, in the dusk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was making
an effort that horribly hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't cry out, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes
swam in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) silence. With them, all the same, through the square opening
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), through the grey panorama of the London night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) achieved
the feat of not losing sight of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wanted; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lips helped
and protected her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) by being able to be gay. <div class="bookquote">``It's not to leave YOU, my
dear--for that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll give up anything; just as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would go off anywhere,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince asked, <div class="bookquote">``you and Charlotte alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie had also to wait a minute, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke it came
clear. <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't Charlotte be just one of MY reasons--my not liking

together--thinking, for the time, almost only of each other; it has been
quite as in old days.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) proceeded consummately, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt it
as consummate: <div class="bookquote">``It's as if we had been missing each other, had got a
little apart--though going on so side by side. But the good moments,

exquisite instincts. But of course you've seen, all the while, that both
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and I have deeply felt how you've managed; managed that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hasn't
been too much alone and that I, on my side, haven't appeared, to--what
you might call--neglect him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). This is always,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``what I

again to making it my care, as always, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shan't. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can't bear
you out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had kept it up and up, filling it out, crowding it in; and all,
really, without difficulty, for it was, every word of it, thanks to a
long evolution of feeling, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been primed to the brim
with. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made the picture, forced it upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), hung it before him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>);
remembering, happily, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had gone so far, one day, supported by the
Principino, as to propose the Zoo in Eaton Square, to carry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>)
there, on the spot, under this pleasant inspiration, both his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) elder and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) younger companion, with the latter of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Eaton</b></font>) had taken the tone
that they were introducing Granddaddy, Granddaddy nervous and rather
funking it, to lions and tigers more or less at large. Touch by touch
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thus dropped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband's silence the truth about his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) good
nature and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) good manners; and it was this demonstration of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
virtue, precisely, that added to the strangeness, even for herself, of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) failing as yet to yield to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). It would be a question but of
the most trivial act of surrender, the vibration of a nerve, the mere
movement of a muscle; but the act grew important between them just
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doing perceptibly nothing, nothing but talk in the very tone
that would naturally have swept her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) into tenderness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew more
and more--every lapsing minute taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might by a single
rightness make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cease to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); that rightness, a million miles
removed from the queer actual, falling so short, which would consist
of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) breaking out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) diviningly, indulgently, with the last happy
inconsequence. <div class="bookquote">``Come away with me, somewhere, YOU--and then we needn't
think, we needn't even talk, of anything, of anyone else:''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>five words
like that would answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), would break her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) utterly down. But they were
the only ones that would so serve. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) waited for them, and there was
a supreme instant when, by the testimony of all the rest of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
seemed to feel them in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart and on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips; only they didn't
sound, and as that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wait again so it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) more intensely
watch. This in turn showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) too watched and waited, and how
much he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had expected something that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) now felt wouldn't come. Yes, it
wouldn't come if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) didn't answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) but said the wrong things
instead of the right. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could say the right everything would
come--it hung by a hair that everything might crystallise for their
recovered happiness at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) touch. This possibility glowed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
however, for fifty seconds, only then to turn cold, and as it fell away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt the chill of reality and knew again, all but pressed
to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart and with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) breath upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cheek, the slim rigour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
attitude, a rigour beyond that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) natural being. They had silences,
at last, that were almost crudities of mutual resistance--silences that
persisted through his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt effort to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) recurrence to the part he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had lately played, to interpret all the sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) so talking
to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as a manner of making love to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Ah, it was no such manner,
heaven knew, for Maggie; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could make love, if this had been in
question, better than that! On top of which it came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) presently
to say, keeping in with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had already spoken: <div class="bookquote">``Except of course
that, for the question of going off somewhere, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d go readily, quite
delightedly, with you. I verily believe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d like to have you for a
while to himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thinks of proposing it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince after a moment
sounded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't ask, as you must so often have seen. But I believe
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d go `like a shot,' as you say, if you were to suggest it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It had the air, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew, of a kind of condition made, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had asked
herself while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke if it wouldn't cause his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) arm to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) go. The
fact that it didn't suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), of a sudden,
still more intensely think, think with such concentration that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could
do but one thing at once. And it was precisely as if the concentration
had the next moment been proved in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) took a turn inconsistent with
the superficial impression--a jump that made light of their approach to
gravity and represented for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the need in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to gain time. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
made out, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) drawback--that the warning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>),
and had come to Charlotte, after all, too suddenly. That they were in
face of it rearranging, that they had to rearrange, was all before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
again; yet to do as they would like they must enjoy a snatch, longer or
shorter, of recovered independence. Amerigo, for the instant, was but
doing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) didn't like, and it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) were watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) effort
without disguise. <div class="bookquote">``What's your father's idea, this year, then, about
Fawns? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) go at Whitsuntide, and will he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) then stay on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie went through the form of thought. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will really do, I imagine,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has, in so many ways, so often done before; do whatever may seem
most agreeable to yourself. And there's of course always Charlotte to be
considered. Only their going early to Fawns, if they do go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``needn't in the least entail your and my going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div>Amerigo echoed, <div class="bookquote">``it needn't in the least entail your and my
going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can do as we like. What they may do needn't trouble us, since
they're by good fortune perfectly happy together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince returned, <div class="bookquote">``your father's never so happy as with you
near him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I may enjoy it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``but I'm not the cause of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're the cause,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband declared, <div class="bookquote">``of the greater part of
everything that's good among us.''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) received this tribute in
silence, and the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) pursued: <div class="bookquote">``If Mrs. Verver has arrears
of time with you to make up, as you say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)'ll scarcely do it--or you
scarcely will--by our cutting, your and my cutting, too loose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie mused.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for a little to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) attention to it; after which, <div class="bookquote">``Shall
I just quite, of a sudden,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``propose him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) a journey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie hesitated, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brought forth the fruit of reflection. <div class="bookquote">``It
would have the merit that Charlotte then would be with me--with me, I
mean, so much more. Also that I shouldn't, by choosing such a time for
going away, seem unconscious and ungrateful, seem not to respond,
seem in fact rather to wish to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) off. I should respond, on the
contrary, very markedly--by being here alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for a month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And would you like to be here alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for a month?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could do with it beautifully. Or we might even,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said quite
gaily, <div class="bookquote">``go together down to Fawns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could be so very content without me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince presently
inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my own dear--if you could be content for a while with father. That
would keep me up. I might, for the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``go to stay there
with Charlotte; or, better still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might come to Portland Place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oho!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>said the Prince with cheerful vagueness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should feel, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``that the two of us were
showing the same sort of kindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Amerigo thought. <div class="bookquote">``The two of us? Charlotte and I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie again hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``You and I, darling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see, I see'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) promptly took it in. <div class="bookquote">``And what reason shall I
give--give, I mean, your father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For asking him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to go off? Why, the very simplest--if you
conscientiously can. The desire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``to be agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
Just that only.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Something in this reply made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband again reflect.
```Conscientiously?' Why shouldn't I conscientiously? It wouldn't, by
your own contention,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) developed, <div class="bookquote">``represent any surprise for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I
must strike him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sufficiently as, at the worst, the last person in the
world to wish to do anything to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah, there it was again, for Maggie--the note already sounded, the note
of the felt need of not working harm! Why this precautionary view, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
asked herself afresh, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father had complained, at the very least,
as little as herself? With their stillness together so perfect, what
had suggested so, around them, the attitude of sparing them? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) inner
vision fixed it once more, this attitude, saw it, in the others,
as vivid and concrete, extended it straight from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion to
Charlotte. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was well aware, accordingly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had echoed in
this intensity of thought Amerigo's last words. <div class="bookquote">``You're the last person
in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heard herself, heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tone, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had spoken, and heard it
the more that, for a minute after, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband's eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
face, very close, too close for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was struck, and looking hard--though his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answer, when it
came, was straight enough. <div class="bookquote">``Why, isn't that just what we have been
talking about--that I've affected you as fairly studying his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comfort and
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pleasure? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might show his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sense of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince went on, <div class="bookquote">``by
proposing to ME an excursion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie immediately asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hung fire but an instant. <div class="bookquote">``Per Dio!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) also had her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pause, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) broke it--since gaiety was in the
air--with an intense smile. <div class="bookquote">``You can say that safely, because the
proposal's one that, of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own motion, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't make.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) couldn't have narrated afterwards--and in fact was at a loss to tell
herself--by what transition, what rather marked abruptness of change
in their personal relation, their drive came to its end with a kind of
interval established, almost confessed to, between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt it in
the tone with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) repeated, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), ```Safely'--?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Safely as regards being thrown with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) perhaps after all, in such a
case, too long. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s a person to think you might easily feel yourself to
be. So it won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie said, <div class="bookquote">``come from father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s too modest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Their eyes continued to meet on it, from corner to corner of the
brougham. <div class="bookquote">``Oh your modesty, between you--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) still smiled for it.
<div class="bookquote">``So that unless I insist--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall simply go on as we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we're going on beautifully,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) answered--though by no means
with the effect it would have had if their mute transaction, that of
attempted capture and achieved escape, had not taken place. As Maggie
said nothing, none the less, to gainsay his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) remark, it was open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
to find himself the next moment conscious of still another idea. <div class="bookquote">``I
wonder if it would do. I mean for me to break in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```To break in'--?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Between your father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife. But there would be a way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
said--<div class="bookquote">``we can make Charlotte ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then as Maggie herself now
wondered, echoing it again: <div class="bookquote">``We can suggest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to suggest to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shall let me take him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asks her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) why I so suddenly break out she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'ll be able to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the footman</b></font>)</div><p/>They were stopping, and the footman, who had alighted, had rung at the
house-door. <div class="bookquote">``That you think it would be so charming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I think it would be so charming. That we've persuaded HER will be
convincing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie went on while the footman came back to let them out. <div class="bookquote">``I
see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said again; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt a little disconcerted. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
really saw, of a sudden, was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stepmother might report her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as
above all concerned for the proposal, and this brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) back her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
need that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father shouldn't think her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) concerned in any degree for
anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) alighted the next instant with a slight sense of defeat;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband, to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) out, had passed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and, a little in
advance, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) on the edge of the low terrace, a step high,
that preceded their open entrance, on either side of which one of their
servants stood. The sense of a life tremendously ordered and fixed rose
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and there was something in Amerigo's very face, while his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
eyes again met her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own through the dusky lamplight, that was like a
conscious reminder of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), just before, distinctly,
and it appeared to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) nothing to say. It was almost as if, having
planned for the last word, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) himself enjoying it. It was
almost as if--in the strangest way in the world--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
back, by the production of a small pang, that of a new uneasiness, for
the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had slipped from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) during their drive.



<p/>XXVIII

<p/>Maggie's new uneasiness might have had time to drop, inasmuch as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
not only was conscious, during several days that followed, of no fresh
indication for it to feed on, but was even struck, in quite another way,
with an augmentation of the symptoms of that difference she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had taken it
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head to work for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) recognised by the end of a week that if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been in a manner caught up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father had been not less so--with
the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband's and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's closing in, together, round
them, and of their all having suddenly begun, as a party of four, to
lead a life gregarious, and from that reason almost hilarious, so far
as the easy sound of it went, as never before. It might have been an
accident and a mere coincidence--so at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said to herself at
first; but a dozen chances that furthered the whole appearance had risen
to the surface, pleasant pretexts, oh certainly pleasant, as pleasant
as Amerigo in particular could make them, for associated undertakings,
quite for shared adventures, for its always turning out, amusingly, that
they wanted to do very much the same thing at the same time and in the
same way. Funny all this was, to some extent, in the light of the fact
that the father and daughter, for so long, had expressed so few positive
desires; yet it would be sufficiently natural that if Amerigo and
Charlotte HAD at last got a little tired of each other's company they
should find their relief not so much in sinking to the rather low level
of their companions as in wishing to pull the latter into the train
in which they so constantly moved. <div class="bookquote">``We're in the train,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie mutely
reflected after the dinner in Eaton Square with Lady Castledean; <div class="bookquote">``we've
suddenly waked up in it and found ourselves rushing along, very much
as if we had been put in during sleep--shoved, like a pair of labelled
boxes, into the van. And since I wanted to `go' I'm certainly going,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Castledean/Castledean</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) might have added; <div class="bookquote">``I'm moving without trouble--they're doing it
all for us: it's wonderful how they understand and how perfectly
it succeeds.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For that was the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) had most immediately to
acknowledge: it seemed as easy for them to make a quartette as it had
formerly so long appeared for them to make a pair of couples--this
latter being thus a discovery too absurdly belated. The only point
at which, day after day, the success appeared at all qualified was
represented, as might have been said, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) irresistible impulse
to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) father a clutch when the train indulged in one of its
occasional lurches. Then--there was no denying it--his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) own
met; so that they were themselves doing active violence, as against
the others, to that very spirit of union, or at least to that very
achievement of change, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Castledean</b></font>) had taken the field to invoke.

<p/>The maximum of change was reached, no doubt, the day the Matcham party
dined in Portland Place; the day, really perhaps, of Maggie's maximum of
social glory, in the sense of its showing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own occasion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
very own, with every one else extravagantly rallying and falling in,
absolutely conspiring to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) its heroine. It was as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father
himself, always with more initiative as a guest than as a host, had
dabbled too in the conspiracy; and the impression was not diminished by
the presence of the Assinghams, likewise very much caught-up, now, after
something of a lull, by the side-wind of all the rest of the motion,
and giving our young woman, so far at least as Fanny was concerned, the
sense of some special intention of encouragement and applause. Fanny,
who had not been present at the other dinner, thanks to a preference
entertained and expressed by Charlotte, made a splendid show at this
one, in new orange-coloured velvet with multiplied turquoises, and
with a confidence, furthermore, as different as possible, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hostess
inferred, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) too-marked betrayal of a belittled state at Matcham.
Maggie was not indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own opportunity to redress this
balance--which seemed, for the hour, part of a general rectification;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) liked making out for herself that on the high level of Portland
Place, a spot exempt, on all sorts of grounds, from jealous
jurisdictions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend could feel as <div class="bookquote">``good''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>as any one, and could
in fact at moments almost appear to take the lead in recognition and
celebration, so far as the evening might conduce to intensify the lustre
of the little Princess. Mrs. Assingham produced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) the impression
of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) constantly her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) cue for this; and it was in truth partly
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) help, intelligently, quite gratefully accepted, that the
little Princess, in Maggie, was drawn out and emphasised. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) couldn't
definitely have said how it happened, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) felt herself, for the
first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) career, living up to the public and popular notion
of such a personage, as it pressed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) from all round; rather
wondering, inwardly too, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) did so, at that strange mixture in
things through which the popular notion could be evidenced for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) by
such supposedly great ones of the earth as the Castledeans and their
kind. Fanny Assingham might really have been there, at all events, like
one of the assistants in the ring at the circus, to keep up the pace
of the sleek revolving animal on whose back the lady in short spangled
skirts should brilliantly caper and posture. That was all, doubtless
Maggie had forgotten, had neglected, had declined, to be the little
Princess on anything like the scale open to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>); but now that the
collective hand had been held out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) with such alacrity, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
might skip up into the light, even, as seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) modest mind,
with such a show of pink stocking and such an abbreviation of white
petticoat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) could strike herself as perceiving, under arched
eyebrows, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) mistake had been. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had invited for the later
hours, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) dinner, a fresh contingent, the whole list of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
apparent London acquaintance--which was again a thing in the manner of
little princesses for whom the princely art was a matter of course. That
was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was learning to do, to fill out as a matter of course her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
appointed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) expected, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) imposed character; and, though there were
latent considerations that somewhat interfered with the lesson, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
was having to-night an inordinate quantity of practice, none of it so
successful as when, quite wittingly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) directed it at Lady Castledean,
who was reduced by it at last to an unprecedented state of passivity.
The perception of this high result caused Mrs. Assingham fairly to flush
with responsive joy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) glittered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) young friend, from moment to
moment, quite feverishly; it was positively as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) young friend had,
in some marvellous, sudden, supersubtle way, become a source of succour
to herself, become beautifully, divinely retributive. The intensity of
the taste of these registered phenomena was in fact that somehow, by
a process and through a connexion not again to be traced, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) so
practised, at the same time, on Amerigo and Charlotte--with only the
drawback, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) constant check and second-thought, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) concomitantly
practised perhaps still more on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father.

<p/>This last was a danger indeed that, for much of the ensuing time,
had its hours of strange beguilement--those at which her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sense for
precautions so suffered itself to lapse that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) communion with
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more intimate than any other. It COULDN'T but pass between them that
something singular was happening--so much as this she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) again and again
said to herself; whereby the comfort of it was there, after all, to be
noted, just as much as the possible peril, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could think of the
couple they formed together as groping, with sealed lips, but with
mutual looks that had never been so tender, for some freedom, some
fiction, some figured bravery, under which they might safely talk of
it. The moment was to come--and it finally came with an effect as
penetrating as the sound that follows the pressure of an electric
button--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) read the least helpful of meanings into the agitation
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had created. The merely specious description of their case would
have been that, after being for a long time, as a family, delightfully,
uninterruptedly happy, they had still had a new felicity to discover;
a felicity for which, blessedly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father's appetite and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own, in
particular, had been kept fresh and grateful. This livelier march of
their intercourse as a whole was the thing that occasionally determined
in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the clutching instinct we have glanced at; very much as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), in default of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) breaking silence first: <div class="bookquote">``Everything is
remarkably pleasant, isn't it?--but WHERE, for it, after all, are we?
up in a balloon and whirling through space, or down in the depths of the
earth, in the glimmering passages of a gold-mine?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>The equilibrium, the
precious condition, lasted in spite of rearrangement; there had been a
fresh distribution of the different weights, but the balance persisted
and triumphed: all of which was just the reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was forbidden,
face to face with the companion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) adventure, the experiment of a
test. If they balanced they balanced--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had to take that; it deprived
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) of every pretext for arriving, by however covert a process, at what
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) thought.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hours, thus, of feeling supremely linked to him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) by the
rigour of their law, and when it came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) that, all the while, the
wish, on his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) side, to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might be what most worked with him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), this
very fact of their seeming to have nothing <div class="bookquote">``inward''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>really to talk about
wrapped him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in a kind of sweetness that was wanting, as a
consecration, even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) yearning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was powerless,
however, was only more utterly hushed, when the interrupting flash came,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would have been all ready to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Yes, this is by every
appearance the best time we've had yet; but don't you see, all the same,
how they must be working together for it, and how my very success, my
success in shifting our beautiful harmony to a new basis, comes round
to being their success, above all; their cleverness, their amiability,
their power to hold out, their complete possession, in short, of our
life?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>For how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) say as much as that without saying a great deal
more? without saying <div class="bookquote">``They'll do everything in the world that suits
us, save only one thing--prescribe a line for us that will make them
separate.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) so much as imagine herself even faintly
murmuring that without putting into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mouth the very words that would
have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) quail? <div class="bookquote">``Separate, my dear? Do you want them to separate?
Then you want US to--you and me? For how can the one separation take
place without the other?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>That was the question that, in spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ask--with its dread train, moreover, of involved and connected
inquiries. Their own separation, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and hers, was of course perfectly
thinkable, but only on the basis of the sharpest of reasons. Well, the
sharpest, the very sharpest, would be that they could no longer afford,
as it were, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to let his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``run''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>them in
such compact formation. And say they accepted this account of their
situation as a practical finality, acting upon it and proceeding to a
division, would no sombre ghosts of the smothered past, on either side,
show, across the widening strait, pale unappeased faces, or raise, in
the very passage, deprecating, denouncing hands?

<p/>Meanwhile, however such things might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was to have occasion to say
to herself that there might be but a deeper treachery in recoveries and
reassurances. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was to feel alone again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had felt at the issue
of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) high tension with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband during their return from meeting
the Castledeans in Eaton Square. The evening in question had left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
with a larger alarm, but then a lull had come--the alarm, after all, was
yet to be confirmed. There came an hour, inevitably, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew, with
a chill, what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had feared and why; it had taken, this hour, a month
to arrive, but to find it before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was thoroughly to recognise it, for
it showed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sharply what Amerigo had meant in alluding to a particular
use that they might make, for their reaffirmed harmony and prosperity,
of Charlotte. The more she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thought, at present, of the tone he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had
employed to express their enjoyment of this resource, the more it came
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as the product of a conscious art of dealing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
had been conscious, at the moment, of many things--conscious even, not a
little, of desiring; and thereby of needing, to see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would do
in a given case. The given case would be that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) being to a certain
extent, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might fairly make it out, MENACED--horrible as it was to
impute to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) any intention represented by such a word. Why it was that
to speak of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stepmother intervene, as they might call it, in
a question that seemed, just then and there, quite peculiarly their own
business--why it was that a turn so familiar and so easy should, at the
worst, strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as charged with the spirit of a threat, was an oddity
disconnected, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), temporarily, from its grounds, the adventure
of an imagination within her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) that possibly had lost its way. That,
precisely, was doubtless why she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had learned to wait, as the weeks
passed by, with a fair, or rather indeed with an excessive, imitation
of resumed serenity. There had been no prompt sequel to the Prince's
equivocal light, and that made for patience; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was none the less
to have to admit, after delay, that the bread he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had cast on the
waters had come home, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should thus be justified of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) old
apprehension. The consequence of this, in turn, was a renewed pang in
presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) remembered ingenuity. To be ingenious with HER--what
DIDN'T, what mightn't that mean, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had so absolutely never, at
any point of contact with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), put him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), by as much as the value of a
penny, to the expense of sparing, doubting, fearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), of having
in any way whatever to reckon with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)? The ingenuity had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
simply speaking of their use of Charlotte as if it were common to them
in an equal degree, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) triumph, on the occasion, had been just in
the simplicity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew it--say what was true: <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
you `use' her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), and I use her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), if you will, yes; but we use her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) ever
so differently and separately--not at all in the same way or degree.
There's nobody we really use together but ourselves, don't you see?--by
which I mean that where our interests are the same I can so beautifully,
so exquisitely serve you for everything, and you can so beautifully, so
exquisitely serve me. The only person either of us needs is the other
of us; so why, as a matter of course, in such a case as this, drag in
Charlotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't so challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), because it would have been--and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
was paralysed--the NOTE. It would have translated itself on the spot,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) ear, into jealousy; and, from reverberation to repercussion,
would have reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father's exactly in the form of a cry piercing
the stillness of peaceful sleep. It had been for many days almost as
difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to catch a quiet twenty minutes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father as
it had formerly been easy; there had been in fact, of old--the time,
so strangely, seemed already far away--an inevitability in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) longer
passages with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), a sort of domesticated beauty in the calculability,
round about them, of everything. But at present Charlotte was almost
always there when Amerigo brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to Eaton Square, where Amerigo
was constantly bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); and Amerigo was almost always there when
Charlotte brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband to Portland Place, where Charlotte was
constantly bringing HIM. The fractions of occasions, the chance minutes
that put them face to face had, as yet, of late, contrived to count but
little, between them, either for the sense of opportunity or for that
of exposure; inasmuch as the lifelong rhythm of their intercourse made
against all cursory handling of deep things. They had never availed
themselves of any given quarter-of-an-hour to gossip about fundamentals;
they moved slowly through large still spaces; they could be silent
together, at any time, beautifully, with much more comfort than
hurriedly expressive. It appeared indeed to have become true that their
common appeal measured itself, for vividness, just by this economy of
sound; they might have been talking <div class="bookquote">``at''  (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>each other when they talked
with their companions, but these latter, assuredly, were not in any
directer way to gain light on the current phase of their relation. Such
were some of the reasons for which Maggie suspected fundamentals, as
I have called them, to be rising, by a new movement, to the
surface--suspected it one morning late in May, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father presented
himself in Portland Place alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pretext--of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
fully aware: the Principino, two days before, had shown signs, happily
not persistent, of a feverish cold and had notoriously been obliged to
spend the interval at home. This was ground, ample ground, for punctual
inquiry; but what it wasn't ground for, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) quickly found herself
reflecting, was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) having managed, in the interest of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) visit,
to dispense so unwontedly--as their life had recently come to be
arranged--with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife's attendance. It had so happened that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
herself was, for the hour, exempt from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's, and it will at
once be seen that the hour had a quality all its own when I note that,
remembering how the Prince had looked in to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was going out, the
Princess whimsically wondered if their respective sposi mightn't frankly
be meeting, whimsically hoped indeed they were temporarily so disposed
of. Strange was her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) need, at moments, to think of them as not attaching
an excessive importance to their repudiation of the general practice
that had rested only a few weeks before on such a consecrated rightness.
Repudiations, surely, were not in the air--they had none of them come to
that; for wasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) at this minute testifying directly against them by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) own behaviour? When she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) should confess to fear of being alone with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father, to fear of what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might then--ah, with such a slow, painful
motion as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had a horror of!--say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), THEN would be time enough
for Amerigo and Charlotte to confess to not liking to appear to
foregather.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had this morning a wonderful consciousness both of dreading a
particular question from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and of being able to check, yes even to
disconcert, magnificently, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) apparent manner of receiving it, any
restless imagination he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might have about its importance. The day, bright
and soft, had the breath of summer; it made them talk, to begin with, of
Fawns, of the way Fawns invited--Maggie aware, the while, that in thus
regarding, with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), the sweetness of its invitation to one couple just
as much as to another, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) humbugging smile grew very nearly convulsive.
That was it, and there was relief truly, of a sort, in taking it in:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was humbugging him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) already, by absolute necessity, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never,
never done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life--doing it up to the full height of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had allowed for. The necessity, in the great dimly-shining room where,
declining, for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reasons, to sit down, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) moved about in Amerigo's
very footsteps, the necessity affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as pressing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with the
very force of the charm itself; of the old pleasantness, between them,
so candidly playing up there again; of the positive flatness of their
tenderness, a surface all for familiar use, quite as if generalised from
the long succession of tapestried sofas, sweetly faded, on which his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
theory of contentment had sat, through unmeasured pauses, beside
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) KNEW, from this instant, knew in advance and as well
as anything would ever teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must never intermit for
a solitary second her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) so highly undertaking to prove that there was
nothing the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw, of a sudden, everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might
say or do in the light of that undertaking, established connections from
it with any number of remote matters, struck herself, for instance, as
acting all in its interest when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) proposed their going out, in the
exercise of their freedom and in homage to the season, for a turn in
the Regent's Park. This resort was close at hand, at the top of Portland
Place, and the Principino, beautifully better, had already proceeded
there under high attendance: all of which considerations were defensive
for Maggie, all of which became, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind, part of the business of
cultivating continuity.

<p/>Upstairs, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) to put on something to go out in, the
thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) waiting below for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), in possession of the empty house,
brought with it, sharply if briefly, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) abrupt arrests of
consistency, the brush of a vain imagination almost paralysing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
often, for the minute, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) glass--the vivid look, in other
words, of the particular difference his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) marriage had made. The
particular difference seemed at such instants the loss, more than
anything else, of their old freedom, their never having had to think,
where they were together concerned, of any one, of anything but each
other. It hadn't been HER marriage that did it; that had never,
for three seconds, suggested to either of them that they must act
diplomatically, must reckon with another presence--no, not even with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
husband's. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) groaned to herself, while the vain imagination lasted,
<div class="bookquote">``WHY did he (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) marry? ah, why DID he (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and then it came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) more than
ever that nothing could have been more beautiful than the way in which,
till Charlotte came so much more closely into their life, Amerigo hadn't
interfered. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had gone on owing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for this mounted up again,
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes, like a column of figures--or call it even, if one would,
a house of cards; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father's wonderful act that had tipped the
house down and made the sum wrong. With all of which, immediately after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) question, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>), why did he (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rushed back, inevitably, the
confounding, the overwhelming wave of the knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reason. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>)
did it for ME, he (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) did it for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) moaned, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) did it, exactly, that
our freedom--meaning, beloved man, simply and solely mine--should be
greater instead of less; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did it, divinely, to liberate me so far as
possible from caring what became of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) found time upstairs,
even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) haste, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had repeatedly found time before, to let
the wonderments involved in these recognitions flash at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) with their
customary effect of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) blink: the question in especial of
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might find her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) solution in acting, herself, in the spirit of
what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done, in forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``care''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>really to grow as much less as
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had tried to make it. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt the whole weight of their case
drop afresh upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shoulders, was confronted, unmistakably, with the
prime source of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) haunted state. It all came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) not having been
able not to mind--not to mind what became of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); not having been able,
without anxiety, to let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) go his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way and take his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) risk and lead his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had made anxiety her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stupid little idol; and absolutely now,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stuck a long pin, a trifle fallaciously, into her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hat--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had, with an approach to irritation, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) maid, a new woman, whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had lately found herself thinking of as abysmal, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't
want her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tried to focus the possibility of some understanding
between them in consequence of which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should cut loose.

<p/>Very near indeed it looked, any such possibility! that consciousness,
too, had taken its turn by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was ready; all the vibration,
all the emotion of this present passage being, precisely, in the very
sweetness of their lapse back into the conditions of the simpler time,
into a queer resemblance between the aspect and the feeling of the
moment and those of numberless other moments that were sufficiently far
away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been quick in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) preparation, in spite of the flow of the
tide that sometimes took away her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) breath; but a pause, once more, was
still left for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to make, a pause, at the top of the stairs, before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) came down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), in the span of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) asked herself if it
weren't thinkable, from the perfectly practical point of view, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should simply sacrifice him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't go into the detail of what
sacrificing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would mean--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't need to; so distinct was it, in
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) restless lights, that there he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
should find him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) walking up and down the drawing-room in the warm,
fragrant air to which the open windows and the abundant flowers
contributed; slowly and vaguely moving there and looking very slight
and young and, superficially, manageable, almost as much like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) child,
putting it a little freely, as like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) parent; with the appearance
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), above all, of having perhaps arrived just on purpose to SAY
it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), himself, in so many words: <div class="bookquote">``Sacrifice me, my own love; do
sacrifice me, do sacrifice me!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) want to, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) insist on
it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might verily hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) bleating it at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), all conscious and all
accommodating, like some precious, spotless, exceptionally intelligent
lamb. The positive effect of the intensity of this figure, however,
was to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shake it away in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) resumed descent; and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
rejoined him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), after she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to know the full
pang of the thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) impossibility was MADE, absolutely, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
consciousness, by the lucidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) intention: this she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
smiled there for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), again, all hypocritically; while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) drew on
fair, fresh gloves; while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) interrupted the process first to give
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) necktie a slightly smarter twist and then to make up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hidden madness by rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) nose into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cheek according to the
tradition of their frankest levity.

<p/>From the instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should be able to convict him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) of intending, every
issue would be closed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hypocrisy would have to redouble. The
only way to sacrifice him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would be to do so without his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dreaming what
it might be for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cravat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dropped
remarks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) guided him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) arm, not to be led, but to
lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and taking it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) by much the same intimate pressure she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had always used, when a little girl, to mark the inseparability of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
doll--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did all these things so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should sufficiently fail to
dream of what they might be for.



<p/>XXIX

<p/>There was nothing to show that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) effort in any degree fell short till
they got well into the Park and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) struck her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as giving, unexpectedly,
the go-by to any serious search for the Principino. The way they sat
down awhile in the sun was a sign of that; his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dropping with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into
the first pair of sequestered chairs they came across and waiting a
little, after they were placed, as if now at last she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might bring out,
as between them, something more specific. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) but feel the more
sharply how the specific, in almost any direction, was utterly forbidden
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--how the use of it would be, for all the world, like undoing the
leash of a dog eager to follow up a scent. It would come out, the
specific, where the dog would come out; would run to earth, somehow, the
truth--for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was believing herself in relation to the truth!--at which
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mustn't so much as indirectly point. Such, at any rate, was the
fashion in which her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) passionate prudence played over possibilities of
danger, reading symptoms and betrayals into everything she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at,
and yet having to make it evident, while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) recognised them, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
didn't wince. There were moments between them, in their chairs, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have been watching her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) guard herself and trying to think of
something new that would trip her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up. There were pauses during which,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) affection as sweet and still as the sunshine, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might yet,
as at some hard game, over a table, for money, have been defying him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to
fasten upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the least little complication of consciousness. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
positively proud, afterwards, of the great style in which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had kept
this up; later on, at the hour's end, when they had retraced their steps
to find Amerigo and Charlotte awaiting them at the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was able
to say to herself that, truly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) plan through; even though
once more setting herself the difficult task of making their relation,
every minute of the time, not fall below the standard of that other
hour, in the treasured past, which hung there behind them like a framed
picture in a museum, a high watermark for the history of their old
fortune; the summer evening, in the park at Fawns, when, side by side
under the trees just as now, they had let their happy confidence lull
them with its most golden tone. There had been the possibility of a trap
for her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), at present, in the very question of their taking up anew that
residence; wherefore she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had not been the first to sound it, in spite of
the impression from him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) holding off to see what she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would do. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
was saying to herself in secret: <div class="bookquote">``CAN we again, in this form, migrate
there? Can I, for myself, undertake it? face all the intenser keeping-up
and stretching-out, indefinitely, impossibly, that our conditions in the
country, as we've established and accepted them, would stand for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had positively lost herself in this inward doubt--so much she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was
subsequently to remember; but remembering then too that her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) companion,
though perceptibly perhaps as if not to be eager, had broken the ice
very much as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had broken it in Eaton Square after the banquet to the
Castledeans.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mind had taken a long excursion, wandered far into the vision of
what a summer at Fawns, with Amerigo and Charlotte still more eminently
in presence against that higher sky, would bring forth. Wasn't her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
father meanwhile only pretending to talk of it? just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was, in a
manner, pretending to listen? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) got off it, finally, at all events,
for the transition it couldn't well help thrusting out at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); it had
amounted exactly to an arrest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) private excursion by the sense that
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had begun to IMITATE--oh, as never yet!--the ancient tone of gold. It
had verily come from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at last, the question of whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thought it
would be very good--but very good indeed--that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should leave England
for a series of weeks, on some pretext, with the Prince. Then it had
been that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's <div class="bookquote">``menace''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>hadn't really dropped,
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was face to face with the effect of it. Ah, the effect of it
had occupied all the rest of their walk, had stayed out with them and
come home with them, besides making it impossible that they shouldn't
presently feign to recollect how rejoining the child had been their
original purpose. Maggie's uneffaced note was that it had, at the end
of five minutes more, driven them to that endeavour as to a refuge, and
caused them afterwards to rejoice, as well, that the boy's irrepressibly
importunate company, in due course secured and enjoyed, with
the extension imparted by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) governess, a person expectant of
consideration, constituted a cover for any awkwardness. For that was
what it had all come to, that the dear man had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to TRY
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--quite as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been spoken to himself by Charlotte, with the same
fine idea. The Princess took it in, on the spot, firmly grasping it;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) heard them together, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife, dealing with the queer
case. <div class="bookquote">``The Prince tells me that Maggie has a plan for your taking some
foreign journey with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) likes to do everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wants,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) has suggested my speaking to you for it as the thing most likely to
make you consent. So I do speak--see?--being always so eager myself,
as you know, to meet Maggie's wishes. I speak, but without quite
understanding, this time, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) has in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head. Why SHOULD she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), of
a sudden, at this particular moment, desire to ship you off together and
to remain here alone with me? The compliment's all to me, I admit, and
you must decide quite as you like. The Prince is quite ready, evidently,
to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) part--but you'll have it out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). That is you'll have
it out with HER.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Something of that kind was what, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) mind's ear,
Maggie heard--and this, after his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
directly, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's invitation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to have it out. Well, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could say to herself all the rest of the day, that was what they did
while they continued to sit there in their penny chairs, that was what
they HAD done as much as they would now ever, ever, have out anything.
The measure of this, at least, had been given, that each would fight to
the last for the protection, for the perversion, of any real anxiety.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had confessed, instantly, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) humbugging grin, not flinching by
a hair, meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes as mildly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) met hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had confessed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fancy that they might both, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) son-in-law, have welcomed
such an escapade, since they had both been so long so furiously
domestic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had almost cocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hat under the inspiration of this
opportunity to hint how a couple of spirited young men, reacting from
confinement and sallying forth arm-in-arm, might encounter the agreeable
in forms that would strike them for the time at least as novel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
felt for fifty seconds, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes, all so sweetly and falsely, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion's, horribly vulgar; yet without minding it either--such
luck should she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) have if to be nothing worse than vulgar would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
through. <div class="bookquote">``And I thought Amerigo might like it better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had said,
<div class="bookquote">``than wandering off alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) won't go unless I take him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had considered here, and never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life had she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) considered so
promptly and so intently. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) really put it that way, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband,
challenged, might belie the statement; so that what would that do but
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father wonder, make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) perhaps ask straight out, why she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
exerting pressure? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) couldn't of course afford to be suspected for an
instant of exerting pressure; which was why she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was obliged only to make
answer: <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't that be just what you must have out with HIM?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) makes me the proposal. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hasn't made it yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, once more, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was to feel she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had smirked! <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)'s too
shy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you're so sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) so really wants my company?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) has thought you might like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I should--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But with this he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) breath to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) either ask if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to address
the question to Amerigo straight, or inquire if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should be greatly
disappointed by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) letting it drop. What had <div class="bookquote">``settled''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
privately to call it, was that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done neither of these things, and
had thereby markedly stood off from the risk involved in trying to draw
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reason. To attenuate, on the other hand, this appearance, and
quite as if to fill out the too large receptacle made, so musingly,
by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) abstention, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had himself presently given her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a reason--had
positively spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the effort of asking whether he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) judged Charlotte
not to have approved. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had taken everything on himself--THAT was what
had settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had had to wait very little more to feel, with
this, how much he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was taking. The point he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lack of any
eagerness to put time and space, on any such scale, between himself and
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wasn't so unhappy with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--far from it, and Maggie was to
hold that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had grinned back, paternally, through his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rather shielding
glasses, in easy emphasis of this--as to be able to hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
required the relief of absence. Therefore, unless it was for the Prince
himself--!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't think it would have been for Amerigo himself. Amerigo and
I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie had said, <div class="bookquote">``perfectly rub on together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, there we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had again, with sublime blandness, assented. <div class="bookquote">``There we
are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte and I too,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father had gaily proceeded, <div class="bookquote">``perfectly rub on
together.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had appeared for a little to be making time. <div class="bookquote">``To
put it only so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had mildly and happily added--<div class="bookquote">``to put it only so!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had spoken as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might easily put it much better, yet as if the
humour of contented understatement fairly sufficed for the occasion.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had played then, either all consciously or all unconsciously,
into Charlotte's hands; and the effect of this was to render trebly
oppressive Maggie's conviction of Charlotte's plan. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had done what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wanted, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife had--which was also what Amerigo had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) do.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) test, Maggie's test, from becoming possible, and had
applied instead a test of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own. It was exactly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had known
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stepdaughter would be afraid to be summoned to say, under the
least approach to cross-examination, why any change was desirable; and
it was, for our young woman herself, still more prodigiously, as if
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father had been capable of calculations to match, of judging it
important he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shouldn't be brought to demand of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) what was the matter
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Why otherwise, with such an opportunity, hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) demanded
it? Always from calculation--that was why, that was why. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
terrified of the retort he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might have invoked: <div class="bookquote">``What, my dear, if you
come to that, is the matter with YOU?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When, a minute later on, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
followed up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) last note by a touch or two designed still further to
conjure away the ghost of the anomalous, at that climax verily she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would have had to be dumb to the question. <div class="bookquote">``There seems a kind of charm,
doesn't there? on our life--and quite as if, just lately, it had got
itself somehow renewed, had waked up refreshed. A kind of wicked selfish
prosperity perhaps, as if we had grabbed everything, fixed everything,
down to the last lovely object for the last glass case of the last
corner, left over, of my old show. That's the only take-off, that it has
made us perhaps lazy, a wee bit languid--lying like gods together, all
careless of mankind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you consider that we're languid?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--that form of rejoinder she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
jumped at for the sake of its pretty lightness. <div class="bookquote">``Do you consider that
we are careless of mankind?--living as we do in the biggest crowd in the
world, and running about always pursued and pursuing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It had made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) think indeed a little longer than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had meant; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
came up again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have said, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know. We
get nothing but the fun, do we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had hastened to declare; <div class="bookquote">``we certainly get nothing but the
fun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We do it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had remarked, <div class="bookquote">``so beautifully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We do it all so beautifully.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hadn't denied this for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I
see what you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I mean too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had gone on, <div class="bookquote">``that we haven't, no doubt, enough,
the sense of difficulty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough? Enough for what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough not to be selfish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think YOU are selfish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had returned--and had managed not
to wail it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say that it's me particularly--or that it's you or Charlotte or
Amerigo. But we're selfish together--we move as a selfish mass. You see
we want always the same thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had gone on--<div class="bookquote">``and that holds us, that
binds us, together. We want each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had further explained; <div class="bookquote">``only
wanting it, each time, FOR each other. That's what I call the happy
spell; but it's also, a little, possibly, the immorality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>```The immorality'?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had pleasantly echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we're tremendously moral for ourselves--that is for each other;
and I won't pretend that I know exactly at whose particular personal
expense you and I, for instance, are happy. What it comes to, I daresay,
is that there's something haunting--as if it were a bit uncanny--in
such a consciousness of our general comfort and privilege. Unless
indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had rambled on, <div class="bookquote">``it's only I to whom, fantastically, it says
so much. That's all I mean, at any rate--that it's sort of soothing;
as if we were sitting about on divans, with pigtails, smoking opium and
seeing visions. `Let us then be up and doing'--what is it Longfellow
says? That seems sometimes to ring out; like the police breaking
in--into our opium den--to give us a shake. But the beauty of it is, at
the same time, that we ARE doing; we're doing, that is, after all, what
we went in for. We're working it, our life, our chance, whatever you may
call it, as we saw it, as we felt it, from the first. We HAVE worked
it, and what more can you do than that? It's a good deal for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had wound up, <div class="bookquote">``to have made Charlotte so happy--to have so perfectly
contented her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). YOU, from a good way back, were a matter of course--I
mean your being all right; so that I needn't mind your knowing that my
great interest, since then, has rather inevitably been in making sure of
the same success, very much to your advantage as well, for Charlotte. If
we've worked our life, our idea really, as I say--if at any rate I can
sit here and say that I've worked my share of it--it has not been what
you may call least by our having put Charlotte so at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ease. THAT has
been soothing, all round; that has curled up as the biggest of the blue
fumes, or whatever they are, of the opium. Don't you see what a cropper
we would have come if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hadn't settled down as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
concluded by turning to Maggie as for something she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mightn't really have
thought of. <div class="bookquote">``You, darling, in that case, I verily believe, would have
been the one to hate it most.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To hate it--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie had wondered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To hate our having, with our tremendous intentions, not brought it off.
And I daresay I should have hated it for you even more than for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not unlikely perhaps when it was for me, after all, that you did
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had hesitated, but only a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I never told you so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Charlotte herself soon enough told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I never told HER,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father had answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you very sure?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had presently asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I like to think how thoroughly I was taken with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and how
right I was, and how fortunate, to have that for my basis. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
all the good I thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie had returned, <div class="bookquote">``was precisely part of the good.
I mean it was precisely part of it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could so beautifully
understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--understand everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything--and in particular your reasons. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) telling me--that showed
me how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had understood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They were face to face again now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) colour
rise; it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were still finding in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes the concrete image,
the enacted scene, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) passage with Charlotte, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was now
hearing of for the first time and as to which it would have been natural
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should question her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) further. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) forbearance to do so would but
mark, precisely, the complication of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fears. <div class="bookquote">``What she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) does like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
finally said, <div class="bookquote">``is the way it has succeeded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--my whole idea. The way I've been justified. That's the joy I give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). If for HER, either, it had failed--!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That, however, was not worth
talking about; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had broken off. <div class="bookquote">``You think then you could now risk
Fawns?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Risk' it?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, morally--from the point of view I was talking of; that of our
sinking deeper into sloth. Our selfishness, somehow, seems at its
biggest down there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the amusement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) not taking this up. <div class="bookquote">``Is
Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had simply asked, <div class="bookquote">``really ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you and I and Amerigo are. Whenever one corners Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had developed more at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ease, <div class="bookquote">``one finds that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) only wants to know
what we want. Which is what we got her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What we got her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for--exactly!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And so, for a little, even though with
a certain effect of oddity in their more or less successful ease, they
left it; left it till Maggie made the remark that it was all the same
wonderful her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stepmother should be willing, before the season was out,
to exchange so much company for so much comparative solitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had then made answer, <div class="bookquote">``that's because her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) idea, I think, this
time, is that we shall have more people, more than we've hitherto had,
in the country. Don't you remember that THAT, originally, was what we
were to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes--to give us a life.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie had gone through the form of
recalling this, and the light of their ancient candour, shining from so
far back, had seemed to bring out some things so strangely that, with
the sharpness of the vision, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had risen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Well, with a
`life' Fawns will certainly do.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) place while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head; the picture, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) vision, had suddenly swarmed.
The vibration was that of one of the lurches of the mystic train in
which, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was travelling; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was having to
steady herself, this time, before meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had measured
indeed the full difference between the move to Fawns because each of
them now knew the others wanted it and the pairing-off, for a journey,
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, which nobody knew that either wanted.
<div class="bookquote">``More company''  (<font color='red'><b>husband stepmother</b></font>)</div>at Fawns would be effectually enough the key in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stepmother were at work; there was truly no question but
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father must accept any array of visitors. No one could
try to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now. What he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had just said was a direct plea for that,
and what was the plea itself but an act of submission to Charlotte? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had, from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair, been noting her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) look, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had, the next minute,
also risen, and then it was they had reminded each other of their having
come out for the boy. Their junction with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) companion
successfully effected, the four had moved home more slowly, and still
more vaguely; yet with a vagueness that permitted of Maggie's reverting
an instant to the larger issue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we have people in the country then, as you were saying, do you know
for whom my first fancy would be? You may be amused, but it would be for
the Castledeans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. But why should I be amused?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, I mean I am myself. I don't think I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--and yet I like to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>): which, as Amerigo says, is `rum.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't you feel she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s very handsome?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but it isn't for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what is it for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Simply that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) may be THERE--just there before us. It's as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) may
have a value--as if something may come of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). I don't in the least know
what, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) rather irritates me meanwhile. I don't even know, I admit,
why--but if we see her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) often enough I may find out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it matter so very much?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion had asked while they moved
together.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``You mean because you do rather like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) side too had waited a little, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had taken it from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I guess I do rather like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) accepted for the first case she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could recall of their not
being affected by a person in the same way. It came back therefore
to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) pretending; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had gone far enough, and to add to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
appearance of levity she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) further observed that, though they were so
far from a novelty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should also immediately desire, at Fawns, the
presence of the Assinghams. That put everything on a basis independent
of explanations; yet it was extraordinary, at the same time, how much,
once in the country again with the others, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was going, as they used
to say at home, to need the presence of the good Fanny. It was the
strangest thing in the world, but it was as if Mrs. Assingham might in a
manner mitigate the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) consciousness of Charlotte. It was
as if the two would balance, one against the other; as if it came round
again in that fashion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) idea of the equilibrium. It would be like
putting this friend into her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) scale to make weight--into the scale with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) father and herself. Amerigo and Charlotte would be in the other;
therefore it would take the three of them to keep that one straight.
And as this played, all duskily, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mind it had received from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father, with a sound of suddenness, a luminous contribution. <div class="bookquote">``Ah,
rather! DO let's have the Assinghams.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be to have them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``as we used so much to have
them. For a good long stay, in the old way and on the old terms: `as
regular boarders' Fanny used to call it. That is if they'll come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As regular boarders, on the old terms--that's what I should like too.
But I guess they'll come,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion had added in a tone into which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had read meanings. The main meaning was that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was going to
require them quite as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was. His (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) recognition of the new terms
as different from the old, what was that, practically, but a confession
that something had happened, and a perception that, interested in the
situation she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had helped to create, Mrs. Assingham would be, by so much
as this, concerned in its inevitable development? It amounted to an
intimation, off his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) guard, that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) should be thankful for some one to
turn to. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had wished covertly to sound him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had now, in short,
quite given himself away, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had, even at the start, needed
anything MORE to settle her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), here assuredly was enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had hold of
his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) small grandchild as they retraced their steps, swinging the boy's
hand and not bored, as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) never was, by his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) always bristling, like a fat
little porcupine, with shrill interrogation-points--so that, secretly,
while they went, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had wondered again if the equilibrium mightn't have
been more real, mightn't above all have demanded less strange a
study, had it only been on the books that Charlotte should give him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) a
Principino of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had repossessed herself now of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) other arm,
only this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) back, gently, helplessly back, to
what they had tried, for the hour, to get away from--just as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was
consciously drawing the child, and as high Miss Bogle on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) left,
representing the duties of home, was complacently drawing HER. The
duties of home, when the house in Portland Place reappeared, showed,
even from a distance, as vividly there before them. Amerigo and
Charlotte had come in--that is Amerigo had, Charlotte, rather,
having come out--and the pair were perched together in the balcony, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
bare-headed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) divested of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) jacket, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mantle, or whatever, but
crowned with a brilliant brave hat, responsive to the balmy day, which
Maggie immediately <div class="bookquote">``spotted''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>as new, as insuperably original, as worn,
in characteristic generous harmony, for the first time; all, evidently,
to watch for the return of the absent, to be there to take them over
again as punctually as possible. They were gay, they were amused, in
the pleasant morning; they leaned across the rail and called down
their greeting, lighting up the front of the great black house with an
expression that quite broke the monotony, that might almost have shocked
the decency, of Portland Place. The group on the pavement stared up as
at the peopled battlements of a castle; even Miss Bogle, who carried
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) head most aloft, gaped a little, through the interval of space, as
toward truly superior beings. There could scarce have been so much
of the open mouth since the dingy waits, on Christmas Eve, had so
lamentably chanted for pennies--the time when Amerigo, insatiable for
English customs, had come out, with a gasped <div class="bookquote">``Santissima Vergine!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div>to
marvel at the depositaries of this tradition and purchase a reprieve.
Maggie's individual gape was inevitably again for the thought of how the
pair would be at work.



<p/>XXX

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not again, for weeks, had Mrs. Assingham so effectually in
presence as on the afternoon of that lady's return from the Easter party
at Matcham; but the intermission was made up as soon as the date of the
migration to Fawns--that of the more or less simultaneous adjournment of
the two houses--began to be discussed. It had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), promptly, that
this renewal, with an old friend, of the old terms she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had talked of
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father, was the one opening, for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spirit, that wouldn't too
much advertise or betray her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Even her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father, who had always, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would have said, <div class="bookquote">``believed in''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>their ancient ally, wouldn't necessarily
suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) of invoking Fanny's aid toward any special inquiry--and
least of all if Fanny would only act as Fanny so easily might. Maggie's
measure of Fanny's ease would have been agitating to Mrs. Assingham had
it been all at once revealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)--as, for that matter, it was soon
destined to become even on a comparatively graduated showing. Our young
woman's idea, in particular, was that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) safety, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) escape from being
herself suspected of suspicion, would proceed from this friend's
power to cover, to protect and, as might be, even showily to represent
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--represent, that is, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) relation to the form of the life they were
all actually leading. This would doubtless be, as people said, a large
order; but that Mrs. Assingham existed, substantially, or could somehow
be made prevailingly to exist, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) private benefit, was the finest
flower Maggie had plucked from among the suggestions sown, like abundant
seed, on the occasion of the entertainment offered in Portland Place
to the Matcham company. Mrs. Assingham, that night, rebounding from
dejection, had bristled with bravery and sympathy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had then
absolutely, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had perhaps recklessly, for herself, betrayed the deeper
and darker consciousness--an impression it would now be late for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
inconsistently to attempt to undo. It was with a wonderful air of giving
out all these truths that the Princess at present approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) again;
making doubtless at first a sufficient scruple of letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) know what
in especial she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) asked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), yet not a bit ashamed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) in fact
quite expressly declared, of Fanny's discerned foreboding of the strange
uses she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might perhaps have for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Quite from the first, really,
Maggie said extraordinary things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), such as <div class="bookquote">``You can help me, you
know, my dear, when nobody else can;''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>such as <div class="bookquote">``I almost wish, upon my
word, that you had something the matter with you, that you had lost your
health, or your money, or your reputation -LRB-forgive me, love!-RRB- so that
I might be with you as much as I want, or keep you with ME, without
exciting comment, without exciting any other remark than that such
kindnesses are `like' me.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>We have each our own way of making up for our
unselfishness, and Maggie, who had no small self at all as against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
husband or her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father and only a weak and uncertain one as against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
stepmother, would verily, at this crisis, have seen Mrs. Assingham's
personal life or liberty sacrificed without a pang.

<p/>The attitude that the appetite in question maintained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was to draw
peculiar support moreover from the current aspects and agitations of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) victim. This personage struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), in truth, as ready for almost
anything; as not perhaps effusively protesting, yet as wanting with
a restlessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) own to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wanted. And in the long
run--which was none so long either--there was to be no difficulty, as
happened, about that. It was as if, for all the world, Maggie had let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), fairly responsible for
something; not, to begin with, dotting all the i's nor hooking together
all the links, but treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), without insistence, rather with
caressing confidence, as there to see and to know, to advise and to
assist. The theory, visibly, had patched itself together for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that
the dear woman had somehow, from the early time, had a hand in ALL
their fortunes, so that there was no turn of their common relations
and affairs that couldn't be traced back in some degree to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) original
affectionate interest. On this affectionate interest the good lady's
young friend now built, before her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes--very much as a wise, or even
as a mischievous, child, playing on the floor, might pile up blocks,
skilfully and dizzily, with an eye on the face of a covertly-watching
elder.

<p/>When the blocks tumbled down they but acted after the nature of blocks;
yet the hour would come for their rising so high that the structure
would have to be noticed and admired. Mrs. Assingham's appearance of
unreservedly giving herself involved meanwhile, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) own side, no
separate recognitions: her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) face of almost anxious attention was directed
altogether to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) young friend's so vivid felicity; it suggested that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) took for granted, at the most, certain vague recent enhancements of
that state. If the Princess now, more than before, was going and going,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was prompt to publish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) go, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had always
known she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) WOULD, sooner or later, and that any appeal for participation
must more or less contain and invite the note of triumph. There was a
blankness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) blandness, assuredly, and very nearly an extravagance
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) generalising gaiety; a precipitation of cheer particularly marked
whenever they met again after short separations: meetings during the
first flush of which Maggie sometimes felt reminded of other looks in
other faces; of two strangely unobliterated impressions above all, the
physiognomic light that had played out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband at the shock--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had come at last to talk to herself of the <div class="bookquote">``shock'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) first vision
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) return from Matcham and Gloucester, and the wonder of
Charlotte's beautiful bold wavering gaze when, the next morning in Eaton
Square, this old friend had turned from the window to begin to deal with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had dared to think of it so crudely she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would have said that
Fanny was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), afraid of something she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might say or do, even
as, for their few brief seconds, Amerigo and Charlotte had been--which
made, exactly, an expressive element common to the three. The difference
however was that this look had in the dear woman its oddity of a
constant renewal, whereas it had never for the least little instant
again peeped out of the others. Other looks, other lights, radiant and
steady, with the others, had taken its place, reaching a climax so short
a time ago, that morning of the appearance of the pair on the balcony
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) house to overlook what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been doing with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father; when
their general interested brightness and beauty, attuned to the outbreak
of summer, had seemed to shed down warmth and welcome and the promise of
protection. They were conjoined not to do anything to startle her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--and
now at last so completely that, with experience and practice, they had
almost ceased to fear their liability. Mrs. Assingham, on the other
hand, deprecating such an accident not less, had yet less assurance,
as having less control. The high pitch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) cheer, accordingly, the
tentative, adventurous expressions, of the would-be smiling order, that
preceded her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) approach even like a squad of skirmishers, or whatever they
were called, moving ahead of the baggage train--these things had at
the end of a fortnight brought a dozen times to our young woman's lips
a challenge that had the cunning to await its right occasion, but of the
relief of which, as a demonstration, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meanwhile felt no little need.
<div class="bookquote">``You've such a dread of my possibly complaining to you that you keep
pealing all the bells to drown my voice; but don't cry out, my dear,
till you're hurt--and above all ask yourself how I can be so wicked as
to complain. What in the name of all that's fantastic can you dream
that I have to complain OF?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>Such inquiries the Princess temporarily
succeeded in repressing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) did so, in a measure, by the aid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
wondering if this ambiguity with which her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) friend affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wouldn't
be at present a good deal like the ambiguity with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) herself must
frequently affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) should enjoy, on
HIS (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) part, such a take-up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) but just succeeded, from day to day, in
sparing Mrs. Assingham, and that made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) trying to be as easy
with this associate as Mr. Verver, blessed man, all indulgent but all
inscrutable, was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had extracted from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), none
the less, a vow in respect to the time that, if the Colonel might be
depended on, they would spend at Fawns; and nothing came home to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
more, in this connection, or inspired her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) with a more intimate interest,
than her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sense of absolutely seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) interlocutress forbear to
observe that Charlotte's view of a long visit, even from such allies,
was there to be reckoned with.

<p/>Fanny stood off from that proposition as visibly to the Princess, and as
consciously to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) might have backed away from the edge of
a chasm into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) feared to slip; a truth that contributed again to
keep before our young woman her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own constant danger of advertising her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
subtle processes. That Charlotte should have begun to be restrictive
about the Assinghams--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had never, and for a hundred obviously
good reasons, been before--this in itself was a fact of the highest
value for Maggie, and of a value enhanced by the silence in which
Fanny herself so much too unmistakably dressed it. What gave it quite
thrillingly its price was exactly the circumstance that it thus opposed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stepmother more actively--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was to back up her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) friends
for holding out--than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had ever yet been opposed; though of course
with the involved result of the fine chance given Mrs. Verver to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
husband for explanations. Ah, from the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) should be definitely
CAUGHT in opposition there would be naturally no saying how much
Charlotte's opportunities might multiply! What would become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hauntedly asked, if his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife, on the one side, should
begin to press him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to call his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter to order, and the force of old
habit--to put it only at that--should dispose him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), not less effectively,
to believe in this young person at any price? There she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was, all round,
imprisoned in the circle of the reasons it was impossible she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should
give--certainly give HIM. The house in the country was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house, and
thereby was Charlotte's; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own and Amerigo's only so far as its
proper master and mistress should profusely place it at their disposal.
Maggie felt of course that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw no limit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's profusion,
but this couldn't be even at the best the case with Charlotte's, whom it
would never be decent, when all was said, to reduce to fighting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
preferences. There were hours, truly, when the Princess saw herself
as not unarmed for battle if battle might only take place without
spectators.

<p/>This last advantage for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), was, however, too sadly out of the
question; her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) sole strength lay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) being able to see that if
Charlotte wouldn't <div class="bookquote">``want''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>the Assinghams it would be because that
sentiment too would have motives and grounds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had all the while
command of one way of meeting any objection, any complaint, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
wife's part, reported to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father; it would be open to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
to retort to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) possible <div class="bookquote">``What are your reasons, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>by a
lucidly-produced <div class="bookquote">``What are hers, love, please?--isn't that what we had
better know? Mayn't her (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) reasons be a dislike, beautifully founded, of
the presence, and thereby of the observation, of persons who perhaps
know about her (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) things it's inconvenient to her (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) they should know?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>That
hideous card she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might in mere logic play--being by this time, at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
still swifter private pace, intimately familiar with all the fingered
pasteboard in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pack. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could play it only on the forbidden
issue of sacrificing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); the issue so forbidden that it involved even
a horror of finding out if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would really have consented to be
sacrificed. What she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must do she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must do by keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands off him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>);
and nothing meanwhile, as we see, had less in common with that scruple
than such a merciless manipulation of their yielding beneficiaries as
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spirit so boldly revelled in. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw herself, in this connexion,
without detachment--saw others alone with intensity; otherwise she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might
have been struck, fairly have been amused, by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) free assignment of
the pachydermatous quality. If SHE could face the awkwardness of the
persistence of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) friends at Fawns in spite of Charlotte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) somehow
looked to them for an inspiration of courage that would improve upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
own. They were in short not only themselves to find a plausibility and
an audacity, but were somehow by the way to pick up these forms for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>),
Maggie, as well. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt indeed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was giving them scant
time longer when, one afternoon in Portland Place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) broke out with an
irrelevance that was merely superficial.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What awfulness, in heaven's name, is there between them? What do you
believe, what do you KNOW?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went by faces her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) visitor's sudden whiteness, at this, might
have carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) far! Fanny Assingham turned pale for it, but there was
something in such an appearance, in the look it put into the eyes, that
renewed Maggie's conviction of what this companion had been expecting.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been watching it come, come from afar, and now that it was
there, after all, and the first convulsion over, they would doubtless
soon find themselves in a more real relation. It was there because of
the Sunday luncheon they had partaken of alone together; it was there,
as strangely as one would, because of the bad weather, the cold perverse
June rain, that was making the day wrong; it was there because it stood
for the whole sum of the perplexities and duplicities among which our
young woman felt herself lately to have picked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) steps; it was there
because Amerigo and Charlotte were again paying together alone a <div class="bookquote">``week
end''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>visit which it had been Maggie's plan infernally to promote--just
to see if, this time, they really would; it was there because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
kept Fanny, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side, from paying one she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would manifestly have
been glad to pay, and had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) come instead, stupidly, vacantly,
boringly, to luncheon: all in the spirit of celebrating the fact
that the Prince and Mrs. Verver had thus put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) own power to
describe them exactly as they were. It had abruptly occurred, in truth,
that Maggie required the preliminary help of determining HOW they were;
though, on the other hand, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) guest had answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) question
everything in the hour and the place, everything in all the conditions,
affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as crying it out. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) guest's stare of ignorance, above
all--that of itself at first cried it out. ```Between them?' What do you
mean?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything there shouldn't be, there shouldn't have BEEN--all this time.
Do you believe there is--or what's your idea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny's idea was clearly, to begin with, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) young friend had taken
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) breath away; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) very straight and very hard. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you speak from a suspicion of your own?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak, at last, from a torment. Forgive me if it comes out. I've been
thinking for months and months, and I've no one to turn to, no one to
help me to make things out; no impression but my own, don't you see? to
go by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been thinking for months and months?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham took it in.
<div class="bookquote">``But WHAT then, dear Maggie, have you been thinking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, horrible things--like a little beast that I perhaps am. That
there may be something--something wrong and dreadful, something they
cover up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The elder woman's colour had begun to come back; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was able, though
with a visible effort, to face the question less amazedly. <div class="bookquote">``You imagine,
poor child, that the wretches are in love? Is that it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>But Maggie for a minute only stared back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Help me to find out
WHAT I imagine. I don't know--I've nothing but my perpetual anxiety.
Have you any?--do you see what I mean? If you'll tell me truly, that at
least, one way or the other, will do something for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny's look had taken a peculiar gravity--a fulness with which it
seemed to shine. <div class="bookquote">``Is what it comes to that you're jealous of Charlotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean whether I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)?'' (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>--and Maggie thought. <div class="bookquote">``No; not on
account of father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham returned, <div class="bookquote">``that isn't what one would suppose. What
I ask is if you're jealous on account of your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie presently, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps that may be all. If I'm unhappy
I'm jealous; it must come to the same thing; and with you, at least, I'm
not afraid of the word. If I'm jealous, don't you see? I'm tormented,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on--<div class="bookquote">``and all the more if I'm helpless. And if I'm both helpless
AND tormented I stuff my pocket-handkerchief into my mouth, I keep
it there, for the most part, night and day, so as not to be heard too
indecently moaning. Only now, with you, at last, I can't keep it longer;
I've pulled it out, and here I am fairly screaming at you. They're
away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``so they can't hear; and I'm, by a miracle of
arrangement, not at luncheon with father at home. I live in the midst of
miracles of arrangement, half of which I admit, are my own; I go about
on tiptoe, I watch for every sound, I feel every breath, and yet I try
all the while to seem as smooth as old satin dyed rose-colour. Have you
ever thought of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``as really feeling as I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion, conspicuously, required to be clear. <div class="bookquote">``Jealous, unhappy,
tormented--? No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham; <div class="bookquote">``but at the same time--and though
you may laugh at me for it!--I'm bound to confess that I've never been
so awfully sure of what I may call knowing you. Here you are indeed, as
you say--such a deep little person! I've never imagined your existence
poisoned, and, since you wish to know if I consider that it need
be, I've not the least difficulty in speaking on the spot. Nothing,
decidedly, strikes me as more unnecessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>For a minute after this they remained face to face; Maggie had sprung
up while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend sat enthroned, and, after moving to and fro in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) intensity, now paused to receive the light she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had invoked. It had
accumulated, considerably, by this time, round Mrs. Assingham's ample
presence, and it made, even to our young woman's own sense, a medium in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could at last take a deeper breath. <div class="bookquote">``I've affected you, these
months--and these last weeks in especial--as quiet and natural and
easy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was a question that took, not imperceptibly, some answering.
<div class="bookquote">``You've never affected me, from the first hour I beheld you, as anything
but--in a way all your own--absolutely good and sweet and beautiful. In
a way, as I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham almost caressingly repeated, <div class="bookquote">``just all
your very own--nobody else's at all. I've never thought of you but
as OUTSIDE of ugly things, so ignorant of any falsity or cruelty or
vulgarity as never to have to be touched by them or to touch them. I've
never mixed you up with them; there would have been time enough for that
if they had seemed to be near you. But they haven't--if that's what you
want to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've only believed me contented then because you've believed me
stupid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham had a free smile, now, for the length of this stride,
dissimulated though it might be in a graceful little frisk. <div class="bookquote">``If I had
believed you stupid I shouldn't have thought you interesting, and if I
hadn't thought you interesting I shouldn't have noted whether I `knew'
you, as I've called it, or not. What I've always been conscious of is
your having concealed about you somewhere no small amount of character;
quite as much in fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny smiled, <div class="bookquote">``as one could suppose a person
of your size able to carry. The only thing was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``that
thanks to your never calling one's attention to it, I hadn't made out
much more about it, and should have been vague, above all, as to
WHERE you carried it or kept it. Somewhere UNDER, I should simply have
said--like that little silver cross you once showed me, blest by the
Holy Father, that you always wear, out of sight, next your skin. That
relic I've had a glimpse of'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) continued to invoke the
privilege of humour. <div class="bookquote">``But the precious little innermost, say this time
little golden, personal nature of you--blest by a greater power, I
think, even than the Pope--that you've never consentingly shown me. I'm
not sure you've ever consentingly shown it to anyone. You've been in
general too modest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, trying to follow, almost achieved a little fold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) forehead.
<div class="bookquote">``I strike you as modest to-day--modest when I stand here and scream at
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, your screaming, I've granted you, is something new. I must fit
it on somewhere. The question is, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham further
proceeded, <div class="bookquote">``of what the deuce I can fit it on TO. Do you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
asked, <div class="bookquote">``to the fact of our friends' being, from yesterday to to-morrow,
at a place where they may more or less irresponsibly meet?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) spoke
with the air of putting it as badly for them as possible. <div class="bookquote">``Are you
thinking of their being there alone--of their having consented to be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had waited without result for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion to say: <div class="bookquote">``But
isn't it true that--after you had this time again, at the eleventh hour,
said YOU wouldn't--they would really much rather not have gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--they would certainly much rather not have gone. But I wanted them
to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, my dear child, what in the world is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to see if they WOULD. And they've had to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie added. <div class="bookquote">``It
was the only thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend appeared to wonder. <div class="bookquote">``From the moment you and your father
backed out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't mean go for those people; I mean go for us. For father and
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie went on. <div class="bookquote">``Because now they know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They `know'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny Assingham quavered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I've been for some time past taking more notice. Notice of the
queer things in our life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion for an instant on the point of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) what
these queer things might be; but Mrs. Assingham had the next minute
brushed by that ambiguous opening and taken, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) evidently felt, a
better one. <div class="bookquote">``And is it for that you did it? I mean gave up the visit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's for that I did it. To leave them to themselves--as they less and
less want, or at any rate less and less venture to appear to want, to
be left. As they had for so long arranged things,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess went
on, <div class="bookquote">``you see they sometimes have to be.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>And then, as if baffled by the
lucidity of this, Mrs. Assingham for a little said nothing: <div class="bookquote">``Now do you
think I'm modest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>With time, however; Fanny could brilliantly think anything that would
serve. <div class="bookquote">``I think you're wrong. That, my dear, is my answer to your
question. It demands assuredly the straightest I can make. I see no
`awfulness'--I suspect none. I'm deeply distressed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that
you should do anything else.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It drew again from Maggie a long look.
<div class="bookquote">``You've never even imagined anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, God forbid!--for it's exactly as a woman of imagination that
I speak. There's no moment of my life at which I'm not imagining
something; and it's thanks to that, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham pursued,
<div class="bookquote">``that I figure the sincerity with which your husband, whom you see as
viciously occupied with your stepmother, is interested, is tenderly
interested, in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) admirable, adorable wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) paused a minute as
to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) friend the full benefit of this--as to Maggie's measure
of which, however, no sign came; and then, poor woman, haplessly, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
crowned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) effort.--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wouldn't hurt a hair of your head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>It had produced in Maggie, at once, and apparently in the intended form
of a smile, the most extraordinary expression. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, there it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div><p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) guest had already gone on. <div class="bookquote">``And I'm absolutely certain that
Charlotte wouldn't either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>It kept the Princess, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) strange grimace, standing there.
<div class="bookquote">``No--Charlotte wouldn't either. That's how they've had again to go
off together. They've been afraid not to--lest it should disturb me,
aggravate me, somehow work upon me. As I insisted that they must,
that we couldn't all fail--though father and Charlotte hadn't really
accepted; as I did this they had to yield to the fear that their showing
as afraid to move together would count for them as the greater danger:
which would be the danger, you see, of my feeling myself wronged. Their
least danger, they know, is in going on with all the things that I've
seemed to accept and that I've given no indication, at any moment, of
not accepting. Everything that has come up for them has come up, in
an extraordinary manner, without my having by a sound or a sign given
myself away--so that it's all as wonderful as you may conceive. They
move at any rate among the dangers I speak of--between that of their
doing too much and that of their not having any longer the confidence,
or the nerve, or whatever you may call it, to do enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) tone, by
this time, might have shown a strangeness to match her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) smile; which was
still more marked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wound up. <div class="bookquote">``And that's how I make them do what I
like!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>It had an effect on Mrs. Assingham, who rose with the deliberation that,
from point to point, marked the widening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) grasp. <div class="bookquote">``My dear child,
you're amazing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amazing--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're terrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie thoughtfully shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No; I'm not terrible, and you don't
think me so. I do strike you as surprising, no doubt--but surprisingly
mild. Because--don't you see?--I AM mild. I can bear anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, `bear'!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham fluted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For love,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess.

<p/>Fanny hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Of your father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie repeated.

<p/>It kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend watching. <div class="bookquote">``Of your husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie said again.

<p/>It was, for the moment, as if the distinctness of this might have
determined in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion a choice between two or three highly
different alternatives. Mrs. Assingham's rejoinder, at all
events--however much or however little it was a choice--was presently a
triumph. <div class="bookquote">``Speaking with this love of your own then, have you undertaken
to convey to me that you believe your husband and your father's wife to
be in act and in fact lovers of each other?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>And then as the Princess
didn't at first answer: <div class="bookquote">``Do you call such an allegation as that `mild'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not pretending to be mild to you. But I've told you, and
moreover you must have seen for yourself, how much so I've been to
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham, more brightly again, bridled. <div class="bookquote">``Is that what you call it
when you make them, for terror as you say, do as you like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there wouldn't be any terror for them if they had nothing to hide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham faced her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)--quite steady now. <div class="bookquote">``Are you really conscious,
love, of what you're saying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm saying that I'm bewildered and tormented, and that I've no one but
you to speak to. I've thought, I've in fact been sure, that you've seen
for yourself how much this is the case. It's why I've believed you would
meet me half way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half way to what? To denouncing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny asked, <div class="bookquote">``two persons, friends of
years, whom I've always immensely admired and liked, and against whom I
haven't the shadow of a charge to make?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with wide eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I had much rather you should
denounce me than denounce them. Denounce me, denounce me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if
you can see your way.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was exactly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) appeared to have argued
out with herself. <div class="bookquote">``If, conscientiously, you can denounce me; if,
conscientiously, you can revile me; if, conscientiously, you can put me
in my place for a low-minded little pig--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham, consideringly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) paused for emphasis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall be saved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) friend took it, for a minute, however, by carrying thoughtful eyes,
eyes verily portentous, over her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You say you've no one to speak
to, and you make a point of your having so disguised your feelings--not
having, as you call it, given yourself away. Have you then never seen
it not only as your right, but as your bounden duty, worked up to such a
pitch, to speak to your husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/>Mrs. Assingham stared. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, then it isn't true that you've made no
sign.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie had a silence. <div class="bookquote">``I've made no trouble. I've made no scene. I've
taken no stand. I've neither reproached nor accused him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). You'll say
there's a way in all that of being nasty enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>dropped from Fanny as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) couldn't help it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't think--strangely enough--that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) regards me as nasty.
I think that at bottom--for that IS,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess strangeness</b></font>)</div>said the Princess, <div class="bookquote">``the
strangeness--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s sorry for me. Yes, I think that, deep within, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
pities me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess strangeness</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) companion wondered. <div class="bookquote">``For the state you've let yourself get into?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For not being happy when I've so much to make me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham with alacrity. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) remained
for an instant embarrassed as to a further advance. <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand,
however, how, if you've done nothing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>An impatience from Maggie had checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). ``I've not done absolutely
`nothing.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what then--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on after a minute, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knows what I've done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It produced on Mrs. Assingham's part, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) whole tone and manner
exquisitely aiding, a hush not less prolonged, and the very duration
of which inevitably gave it something of the character of an equal
recognition. <div class="bookquote">``And what then has HE (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie took again a minute. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has been splendid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Splendid'? Then what more do you want?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, what you see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``Not to be afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div><p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) guest again hang fire. <div class="bookquote">``Not to be afraid really to speak?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to be afraid NOT to speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham considered further. <div class="bookquote">``You can't even to Charlotte?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>But
as, at this, after a look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), Maggie turned off with a movement of
suppressed despair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) checked herself and might have been watching
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), for all the difficulty and the pity of it, vaguely moving to the
window and the view of the hill street. It was almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
had to give up, from failure of responsive wit in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend--the last
failure she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had feared--the hope of the particular relief she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been
working for. Mrs. Assingham resumed the next instant, however, in the
very tone that seemed most to promise her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) should have to give up
nothing. <div class="bookquote">``I see, I see; you would have in that case too many things to
consider.''  (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div>It brought the Princess round again, proving itself thus the
note of comprehension she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wished most to clutch at. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie took it where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was soon able to signify.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank-you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>counsellor</b></font>)</div><p/>It very properly encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) counsellor. <div class="bookquote">``What your idea imputes is
a criminal intrigue carried on, from day to day, amid perfect trust and
sympathy, not only under your eyes, but under your father's. That's an
idea it's impossible for me for a. moment to entertain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there you are then! It's exactly what I wanted from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're welcome to it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham breathed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never HAVE entertained it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie pursued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never for an instant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head very high.

<p/>Maggie took it again, yet again as wanting more. <div class="bookquote">``Pardon my being so
horrid. But by all you hold sacred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham faced her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear, upon my positive word as an
honest woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank-you then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess.

<p/>So they remained a little; after which, <div class="bookquote">``But do you believe it, love?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as I've faith in THEM, it comes to the same thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, at this last, appeared for a moment to think again; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
embraced the proposition. <div class="bookquote">``The same thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you're no longer unhappy?''  (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) guest urged, coming more gaily
toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubtless shan't be a great while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was now Mrs. Assingham's turn to want more. <div class="bookquote">``I've convinced you
it's impossible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) arms, and Maggie, after a moment, meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
threw herself into them with a sound that had its oddity as a sign
of relief. <div class="bookquote">``Impossible, impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) emphatically, more than
emphatically, replied; yet the next minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had burst into tears over
the impossibility, and a few seconds later, pressing, clinging, sobbing,
had even caused them to flow, audibly, sympathetically and perversely,
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend.



<p/>XXXI

<p/>The understanding appeared to have come to be that the Colonel and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
wife were to present themselves toward the middle of July for the <div class="bookquote">``good
long visit''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>at Fawns on which Maggie had obtained from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father that
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should genially insist; as well as that the couple from Eaton Square
should welcome there earlier in the month, and less than a week after
their own arrival, the advent of the couple from Portland Place. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
we shall give you time to breathe!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny remarked, in reference to the
general prospect, with a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of
criticism, to each member of the party in turn; sustaining and bracing
herself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) emphasis, pushed even to an amiable cynicism, of the
confident view of these punctualities of the Assinghams. The ground she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
could best occupy, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sense, was that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being moved, as in this
connexion she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had always been moved, by the admitted grossness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
avidity, the way the hospitality of the Ververs met her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) convenience and
ministered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ease, destitute as the Colonel had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), from the
first, of any rustic retreat, any leafy bower of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own, any fixed base
for the stale season now at hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had explained at home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
repeatedly reexplained, the terms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dilemma, the real difficulty of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), or--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now put it--of their position. When the pair could
do nothing else, in Cadogan Place, they could still talk of marvellous
little Maggie, and of the charm, the sinister charm, of their having
to hold their breath to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); a topic the momentous midnight
discussion at which we have been present was so far from having
exhausted. It came up, irrepressibly, at all private hours; they had
planted it there between them, and it grew, from day to day, in a manner
to make their sense of responsibility almost yield to their sense
of fascination. Mrs. Assingham declared at such moments that in the
interest of this admirable young thing--to whom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) also declared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
had quite <div class="bookquote">``come over'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was ready to pass with all the world else,
even with the Prince himself, the object, inconsequently, as well, of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) continued, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) explicitly shameless appreciation, for a vulgar,
indelicate, pestilential woman, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) true character in an
abandoned old age. The Colonel's confessed attention had been enlisted,
we have seen, as never yet, under pressure from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife, by any
guaranteed imbroglio; but this, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) perfectly knew,
was not a bit because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), or touched by what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
let herself in for, but because, when once they had been opened,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) couldn't keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) eyes from resting complacently, resting almost
intelligently, on the Princess. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was in love with HER now, however,
so much the better; it would help them both not to wince at what they
would have to do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>). Mrs. Assingham had come back to that, whenever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) groaned or grunted; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had at no beguiled moment--since Maggie's
little march WAS positively beguiling--let him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) lose sight of the grim
necessity awaiting them. <div class="bookquote">``We shall have, as I've again and again told
you, to lie for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--to lie till we're black in the face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To lie `for' her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div>The Colonel often, at these hours, as from a vague
vision of old chivalry in a new form, wandered into apparent lapses from
lucidity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To lie TO her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), up and down, and in and out--it comes to the same thing.
It will consist just as much of lying to the others too: to the Prince
about one's belief in HIM; to Charlotte about one's belief in HER; to
Mr. Verver, dear sweet man, about one's belief in everyone. So we've
work cut out--with the biggest lie, on top of all, being that we LIKE to
be there for such a purpose. We hate it unspeakably--I'm more ready
to be a coward before it, to let the whole thing, to let everyone,
selfishly and pusillanimously slide, than before any social duty, any
felt human call, that has ever forced me to be decent. I speak at least
for myself. For you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had added, <div class="bookquote">``as I've given you so perfect an
opportunity to fall in love with Maggie, you'll doubtless find your
account in being so much nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you make,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel could, at this, always imperturbably
enough ask, <div class="bookquote">``of the account you yourself will find in being so much
nearer to the Prince; of your confirmed, if not exasperated, infatuation
with whom--to say nothing of my weak good-nature about it--you give such
a pretty picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>To the picture in question she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been always, in fact, able
contemplatively to return. <div class="bookquote">``The difficulty of my enjoyment of that is,
don't you see? that I'm making, in my loyalty to Maggie, a sad hash of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) affection for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You find means to call it then, this whitewashing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) crime, being
`loyal' to Maggie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, about that particular crime there is always much to say. It is
always more interesting to us than any other crime; it has at least
that for it. But of course I call everything I have in mind at all being
loyal to Maggie. Being loyal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) is, more than anything else, helping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father--which is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) most wants and needs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel had had it before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could apparently never have too
much of it. <div class="bookquote">``Helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) `with' him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) against him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) then. Against what we've already so fully
talked of--its having to be recognised between them that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doubts.
That's where my part is so plain--to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) through, to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) through
to the end.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Exaltation, for the moment, always lighted Mrs. Assingham's
reference to this plainness; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) at the same time seldom failed, the
next instant, to qualify her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) view of it. <div class="bookquote">``When I talk of my obligation
as clear I mean that it's absolute; for just HOW, from day to day and
through thick and thin, to keep the thing up is, I grant you, another
matter. There's one way, luckily, nevertheless, in which I'm strong. I
can perfectly count on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel seldom failed here, as from the insidious growth of an
excitement, to wonder, to encourage. <div class="bookquote">``Not to see you're lying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To stick to me fast, whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sees. If I stick to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--that is
to my own poor struggling way, under providence, of watching over them
ALL--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)'ll stand by me to the death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) won't give me away. For, you
know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) easily can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This, regularly, was the most lurid turn of their road; but Bob
Assingham, with each journey, met it as for the first time. <div class="bookquote">``Easily?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) can utterly dishonour me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) can let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) know that
I was aware, at the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marriage--as I had been aware at the
time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own--of the relations that had pre-existed between his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how can she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) do so if, up to this minute, by your own statement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
is herself in ignorance of your knowledge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a question that Mrs. Assingham had ever, for dealing with, a
manner to which repeated practice had given almost a grand effect; very
much as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was invited by it to say that about this, exactly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
proposed to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) best lying. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said, and with full lucidity,
something quite other: it could give itself a little the air, still, of
a triumph over his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) coarseness. <div class="bookquote">``By acting, immediately with the blind
resentment with which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) place, ninety-nine women out of a hundred
would act; and by so making Mr. Verver, in turn, act with the same
natural passion, the passion of ninety-nine men out of a hundred.
They've only to agree about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the poor lady said; <div class="bookquote">``they've only to
feel at one over it, feel bitterly practised upon, cheated and injured;
they've only to denounce me to each other as false and infamous, for me
to be quite irretrievably dished. Of course it's I who have been, and
who continue to be, cheated--cheated by the Prince and Charlotte; but
they're not obliged to give me the benefit of that, or to give either
of us the benefit of anything. They'll be within their rights to lump us
all together as a false, cruel, conspiring crew, and, if they can find
the right facts to support them, get rid of us root and branch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>This, on each occasion, put the matter so at the worst that repetition
even scarce controlled the hot flush with which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was compelled to
see the parts of the whole history, all its ugly consistency and its
temporary gloss, hang together. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) enjoyed, invariably, the sense of
making her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) danger present, of making it real, to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
almost turning pale, when their eyes met, at this possibility of their
compromised state and their shared discredit. The beauty was that, as
under a touch of one of the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
sounded out with the short sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man.
<div class="bookquote">``Conspiring--so far as YOU were concerned--to what end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to the obvious end of getting the Prince a wife--at Maggie's

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>XXXII

<p/>If Maggie had not so firmly made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind never to say, either to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
good friend or to any one else, more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) meant about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have found herself betrayed into some such overflow during the
week spent in London with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband after the others had adjourned
to Fawns for the summer. This was because of the odd element of the
unnatural imparted to the so simple fact of their brief separation by
the assumptions resident in their course of life hitherto. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was used,
herself, certainly, by this time, to dealing with odd elements; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
dropped, instantly, even from such peace as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had patched up, when it
was a question of feeling that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) unpenetrated parent might be alone
with them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) as alone with them when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>)
as alone with Charlotte--and this, strangely enough, even while fixing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sense to the full on his (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) wife's power of preserving, quite of
enhancing, every felicitous appearance. Charlotte had done that--under
immeasurably fewer difficulties indeed--during the numerous months of
their hymeneal absence from England, the period prior to that wonderful
reunion of the couples, in the interest of the larger play of all the
virtues of each, which was now bearing, for Mrs. Verver's stepdaughter
at least, such remarkable fruit. It was the present so much briefer
interval, in a situation, possibly in a relation, so changed--it was the
new terms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) problem that would tax Charlotte's art. The Princess
could pull herself up, repeatedly, by remembering that the real
<div class="bookquote">``relation''  (<font color='red'><b>The Princess</b></font>)</div>between her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife was a thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) knew
nothing about and that, in strictness, was none of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) business; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
none the less failed to keep quiet, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would have called it, before
the projected image of their ostensibly happy isolation. Nothing could
have had less of the quality of quietude than a certain queer wish that
fitfully flickered up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), a wish that usurped, perversely, the place
of a much more natural one. If Charlotte, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was about it, could
only have been WORSE!--that idea Maggie fell to invoking instead of the
idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might desirably have been better. For, exceedingly odd as
it was to feel in such ways, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mightn't have worried so
much if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't somehow make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stepmother out, under the beautiful
trees and among the dear old gardens, as lavish of fifty kinds of
confidence and twenty kinds, at least, of gentleness. Gentleness and
confidence were certainly the right thing, as from a charming woman to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, but the fine tissue of reassurance woven by this lady's
hands and flung over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) companion as a light, muffling veil, formed
precisely a wrought transparency through which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father's
eyes continually rest on herself. The reach of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gaze came to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
straighter from a distance; it showed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as still more conscious, down
there alone, of the suspected, the felt elaboration of the process of
their not alarming or hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had herself now, for weeks and
weeks, and all unwinkingly, traced the extension of this pious effort;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) perfect success in giving no sign--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did herself THAT
credit--would have been an achievement quite wasted if Mrs. Verver
should make with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) those mistakes of proportion, one set of them too
abruptly, too incoherently designed to correct another set, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had
made with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter. However, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) HAD been worse, poor woman, who
should say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) husband would, to a certainty, have been better?

<p/>One groped noiselessly among such questions, and it was actually not
even definite for the Princess that her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) own Amerigo, left alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
in town, had arrived at the golden mean of non-precautionary gallantry
which would tend, by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) calculation, to brush private criticism from
its last perching-place. The truth was, in this connection, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
had different sorts of terrors, and there were hours when it came to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) that these days were a prolonged repetition of that night-drive, of
weeks before, from the other house to their own, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had tried to
charm her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sovereign personal power, into some collapse that
would commit her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) to a repudiation of consistency. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was never alone
with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), it was to be said, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) having sooner or later to ask
herself what had already become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) consistency; yet, at the same
time, so long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) breathed no charge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) kept hold of a remnant of
appearance that could save her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) from attack. Attack, real attack, from
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would conduct it was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) above all dreaded; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was so
far from sure that under that experience she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) mightn't drop into some
depth of weakness, mightn't show him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) some shortest way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
would know how to use again. Therefore, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as yet,
no moment's pretext for pretending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had either lost faith
or suffered by a feather's weight in happiness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), it was
easy to reason, with an immense advantage for all waiting and all
tension. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), for the present, to <div class="bookquote">``make up''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) for
nothing. Who could say to what making-up might lead, into what
consenting or pretending or destroying blindness it might plunge her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) too helplessly, still, to dare to open the door, by an
inch, to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) as if either of them had wronged the other.
Something or somebody--and who, at this, which of them all?--would
inevitably, would in the gust of momentary selfishness, be sacrificed
to that; whereas what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) intelligently needed was to know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was
going. Knowledge, knowledge, was a fascination as well as a fear; and
a part, precisely, of the strangeness of this juncture was the way her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
apprehension that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would break out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) with some merely general
profession was mixed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) dire need to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), to reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
to respond to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), on no ground that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) didn't fully measure. To do
these things it must be clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) what they were FOR; but to act in
that light was, by the same effect, to learn, horribly, what the other
things had been. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) only what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wanted, only what would
work upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) by the beauty of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) appeal; and the result of the direct
appeal of ANY beauty in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) helpless submission to
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) terms. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) temporary safety, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hand-to-mouth success,
accordingly, was in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) neither perceiving nor divining this, thanks to
such means as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) could take to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); take, literally from hour
to hour, during these days of more unbroken exposure. From hour to hour
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) fairly expected some sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) having decided on a jump. <div class="bookquote">``Ah yes,
it HAS been as you think; I've strayed away, I've fancied myself free,
given myself in other quantities, with larger generosities, because I
thought you were different--different from what I now see. But it was
only, only, because I didn't know--and you must admit that you gave
me scarce reason enough. Reason enough, I mean, to keep clear of my
mistake; to which I confess, for which I'll do exquisite penance, which
you can help me now, I too beautifully feel, to get completely over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>That was what, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) watched herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) potentially heard him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
bring out; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) carried to an end another day, another sequence
and yet another of their hours together, without his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) producing it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
felt herself occupied with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) beyond even the intensity of surrender.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) head, for a reason, for a cause; and the labour of
this detachment, with the labour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) keeping the pitch of it down,
held them together in the steel hoop of an intimacy compared with which
artless passion would have been but a beating of the air. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) greatest
danger, or at least her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) greatest motive for care, was the obsession of
the thought that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) actually did suspect, the fruit of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) attention
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) couldn't help being a sense of the growth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) importance.
Taking the measure, with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had taken it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father, of
the prescribed reach of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hypocrisy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) saw how it would have to
stretch even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) seeking to prove that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was NOT, all the same,
important. A single touch from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) should know it in case of
its coming!--any brush of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand, of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lips, of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice, inspired
by recognition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) probable interest as distinct from pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
virtual gloom, would hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) over to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bound hand and foot. Therefore
to be free, to be free to act, other than abjectly, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) must conceal from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the validity that, like a microscopic insect
pushing a grain of sand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was taking on even for herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) could
keep it up with a change in sight, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) couldn't keep it up forever;
so that, really, one extraordinary effect of their week of untempered
confrontation, which bristled with new marks, was to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) reach
out, in thought, to their customary companions and calculate the kind
of relief that rejoining them would bring. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was learning, almost from
minute to minute, to be a mistress of shades since, always, when there
were possibilities enough of intimacy, there were also, by that fact, in
intercourse, possibilities of iridescence; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was working against
an adversary who was a master of shades too, and on whom, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) didn't
look out, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) should presently have imposed a consciousness of the
nature of their struggle. To feel him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in fact, to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) feeling
himself, her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) adversary in things of this fineness--to see him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) at all,
in short, brave a name that would represent him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) as in opposition--
was already to be nearly reduced to a visible smothering of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) cry of
alarm. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) guess they were having, in their so occult manner,
a HIGH fight, and that it was she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), all the while, in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) supposed
stupidity, who had made it high and was keeping it high--in the event of
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) doing this before they could leave town she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) should verily be lost.

<p/>The possible respite for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) at Fawns would come from the fact that
observation, in him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), there, would inevitably find some of its directness
diverted. This would be the case if only because the remarkable strain
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) father's placidity might be thought of as likely to claim some
larger part of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) attention. Besides which there would be always
Charlotte herself to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) off. Charlotte would help him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again,
doubtless, to study anything, right or left, that might be symptomatic;
but Maggie could see that this very fact might perhaps contribute, in
its degree, to protect the secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own fermentation. It is not
even incredible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) may have discovered the gleam of a comfort that
was to broaden in the conceivable effect on the Prince's spirit, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
nerves, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) finer irritability, of some of the very airs and aspects,
the light graces themselves, of Mrs. Verver's too perfect competence.
What it would most come to, after all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) said to herself, was a
renewal for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) of the privilege of watching that lady watch her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Very
well, then: with the elements after all so mixed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), how long would
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) go on enjoying mere spectatorship of that act? For she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had by
this time made up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind that in Charlotte's company he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) deferred to
Charlotte's easier art of mounting guard. Wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) get tired--to put
it only at that--of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) always on the rampart, erect and elegant,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lace-flounced parasol now folded and now shouldered, march to
and fro against a gold-coloured east or west? Maggie had gone far, truly
for a view of the question of this particular reaction, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not
incapable of pulling herself up with the rebuke that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) counted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
chickens before they were hatched. How sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should have to be of
so many things before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might thus find a weariness in Amerigo's
expression and a logic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) weariness!

<p/>One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) dissimulated arts for meeting their tension, meanwhile,
was to interweave Mrs. Assingham as plausibly as possible with the
undulations of their surface, to bring it about that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) should join
them, of an afternoon, when they drove together or if they went to look
at things--looking at things being almost as much a feature of their
life as if they were bazaar-opening royalties. Then there were such
combinations, later in the day, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) attendance on them, and the
Colonel's as well, for such whimsical matters as visits to the opera
no matter who was singing, and sudden outbreaks of curiosity about
the British drama. The good couple from Cadogan Place could always
unprotestingly dine with them and <div class="bookquote">``go on''  (<font color='red'><b>The couple</b></font>)</div>afterwards to such publicities
as the Princess cultivated the boldness of now perversely preferring.
It may be said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) that, during these passages, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) plucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
sensations by the way, detached, nervously, the small wild blossoms
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) dim forest, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) could smile over them at least with the
spacious appearance, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) companions, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) husband above all, of
bravely, of altogether frivolously, going a-maying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) intense,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) smothered excitements, some of which were almost inspirations; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
had in particular the extravagant, positively at moments the amused,
sense of using her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) friend to the topmost notch, accompanied with the
high luxury of not having to explain. Never, no never, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) have
to explain to Fanny Assingham again--who, poor woman, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) own side,
would be charged, it might be forever, with that privilege of the higher
ingenuity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) put it all off on Fanny, and the dear thing herself might
henceforth appraise the quantity. More and more magnificent now in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) blameless egoism, Maggie asked no questions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and thus only
signified the greatness of the opportunity she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't care
for what devotions, what dinners of their own the Assinghams might have
been <div class="bookquote">``booked'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>; that was a detail, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could think without wincing of
the ruptures and rearrangements to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) service condemned them. It
all fell in beautifully, moreover; so that, as hard, at this time, in
spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fever, as a little pointed diamond, the Princess showed
something of the glitter of consciously possessing the constructive, the
creative hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had but to have the fancy of presenting herself, of
presenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) husband, in a certain high and convenient manner, to make
it natural they should go about with their gentleman and their lady. To
what else but this, exactly, had Charlotte, during so many weeks of the
earlier season, worked her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) up?--herself assuming and discharging, so
far as might be, the character and office of one of those revolving
subordinate presences that float in the wake of greatness.

<p/>The precedent was therefore established and the group normally
constituted. Mrs. Assingham, meanwhile, at table, on the stairs, in
the carriage or the opera-box, might--with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) constant overflow of
expression, for that matter, and its singularly resident character where
men in especial were concerned--look across at Amerigo in whatever sense
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) liked: it was not of that Maggie proposed to be afraid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might
warn him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might rebuke him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might--if it
were impossible not to--absolutely make love to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>); even this was open
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as a matter simply between them, if it would help her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to answer
for the impeccability he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had guaranteed. And Maggie desired in fact
only to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as acknowledging the efficacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aid when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) one evening a small project for the morrow, privately
entertained--the idea, irresistible, intense, of going to pay, at the
Museum, a visit to Mr. Crichton. Mr. Crichton, as Mrs. Assingham could
easily remember, was the most accomplished and obliging of public
functionaries, whom every one knew and who knew every one--who had from
the first, in particular, lent himself freely, and for the love of art
and history, to becoming one of the steadier lights of Mr. Verver's
adventurous path. The custodian of one of the richest departments of
the great national collection of precious things, he (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) could feel for the
sincere private collector and urge him (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) way even when condemned
to be present at his (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) capture of trophies sacrificed by the country to
parliamentary thrift. He (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) carried his (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) amiability to the point of saying
that, since London, under pettifogging views, had to miss, from time to
time, its rarest opportunities, he (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) was almost consoled to see such lost
causes invariably wander at last, one by one, with the tormenting tinkle
of their silver bells, into the wondrous, the already famous fold beyond
the Mississippi. There was a charm in his (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``almosts''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>that was not to
be resisted, especially after Mr. Verver and Maggie had grown sure--or
almost, again--of enjoying the monopoly of them; and on this basis of
envy changed to sympathy by the more familiar view of the father and the
daughter, Mr. Crichton had at both houses, though especially in Eaton
Square, learned to fill out the responsive and suggestive character. It
was at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) invitation, Fanny well recalled, that Maggie, one day, long
before, and under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own attendance precisely, had, for the glory of
the name she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bore, paid a visit to one of the ampler shrines of the
supreme exhibitory temple, an alcove of shelves charged with the
gold-and-brown, gold-and-ivory, of old Italian bindings and consecrated
to the records of the Prince's race. It had been an impression that
penetrated, that remained; yet Maggie had sighed, ever so prettily, at
its having to be so superficial. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was to go back some day, to dive
deeper, to linger and taste; in spite of which, however, Mrs. Assingham
could not recollect perceiving that the visit had been repeated. This
second occasion had given way, for a long time, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) happy life, to
other occasions--all testifying, in their degree, to the quality of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
husband's blood, its rich mixture and its many remarkable references;
after which, no doubt, the charming piety involved had grown, on still
further grounds, bewildered and faint.

<p/>It now appeared, none the less, that some renewed conversation with Mr.
Crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly, and Maggie mentioned
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) purpose as a conception of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) very own, to the success of which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) designed to devote her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) morning. Visits of gracious ladies, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>)
protection, lighted up rosily, for this perhaps most flower-loving and
honey-sipping member of the great Bloomsbury hive, its packed passages
and cells; and though not sworn of the province toward which his (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>) friend
had found herself, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>), yearning again,
nothing was easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>) than to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in relation with the
presiding urbanities. So it had been settled, Maggie said to Mrs.
Assingham, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was to dispense with Amerigo's company. Fanny was to
remember later on that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had at first taken this last fact for one of
the finer notes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) young woman's detachment, imagined she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must be
going alone because of the shade of irony that, in these ambiguous days,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) husband's personal presence might be felt to confer, practically, on
any tribute to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) transmitted significance. Then as, the next
moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt it clear that so much plotted freedom was virtually
a refinement of reflection, an impulse to commemorate afresh whatever
might still survive of pride and hope, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sense of ambiguity happily
fell and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) congratulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) companion on having anything so exquisite
to do and on being so exquisitely in the humour to do it. After the
occasion had come and gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was confirmed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) optimism; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) made
out, in the evening, that the hour spent among the projected lights, the
annals and illustrations, the parchments and portraits, the emblazoned
volumes and the murmured commentary, had been for the Princess enlarging
and inspiring. Maggie had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) some days before, very sweetly but
very firmly, <div class="bookquote">``Invite us to dine, please, for Friday, and have any one
you like or you can--it doesn't in the least matter whom;''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>and the pair
in Cadogan Place had bent to this mandate with a docility not in the
least ruffled by all that it took for granted.

<p/>It provided for an evening--this had been Maggie's view; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lived
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) view, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend's eyes, by treating the occasion, more or
less explicitly, as new and strange. The good Assinghams had feasted in
fact at the two other boards on a scale so disproportionate to the scant
solicitations of their own that it was easy to make a joke of seeing how
they fed at home, how they met, themselves, the question of giving to
eat. Maggie dined with them, in short, and arrived at making her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband
appear to dine, much in the manner of a pair of young sovereigns who
have, in the frolic humour of the golden years of reigns, proposed
themselves to a pair of faithfully-serving subjects. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) showed an
interest in their arrangements, an inquiring tenderness almost for their
economies; so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hostess not unnaturally, as they might have
said, put it all down--the tone and the freedom of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) set the
example--to the effect wrought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) afresh by one of the lessons
learned, in the morning, at the altar of the past. Hadn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) picked it
up, from an anecdote or two offered again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) attention, that there
were, for princesses of such a line, more ways than one of being a
heroine? Maggie's way to-night was to surprise them all, truly, by
the extravagance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) affability. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was doubtless not positively
boisterous; yet, though Mrs. Assingham, as a bland critic, had never
doubted her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) being graceful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) put so much of it
into being what might have been called assertive. It was all a tune
to which Fanny's heart could privately palpitate: her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) guest was happy,
happy as a consequence of something that had occurred, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
making the Prince not lose a ripple of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) laugh, though not perhaps
always enabling him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to find it absolutely not foolish. Foolish, in
public, beyond a certain point, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was scarce the man to brook his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
wife's being thought to be; so that there hovered before their friend
the possibility of some subsequent scene between them, in the carriage
or at home, of slightly sarcastic inquiry, of promptly invited
explanation; a scene that, according as Maggie should play her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) part
in it, might or might not precipitate developments. What made these
appearances practically thrilling, meanwhile, was this mystery--a
mystery, it was clear, to Amerigo himself--of the incident or the
influence that had so peculiarly determined them.

<p/>The lady of Cadogan Place was to read deeper, however, within
three days, and the page was turned for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on the eve of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) young
confidant's leaving London. The awaited migration to Fawns was to take
place on the morrow, and it was known meanwhile to Mrs. Assingham that
their party of four were to dine that night, at the American Embassy,
with another and a larger party; so that the elder woman had a sense
of surprise on receiving from the younger, under date of six o’clock,
a telegram requesting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) immediate attendance. <div class="bookquote">``Please come to me
at once; dress early, if necessary, so that we shall have time: the
carriage, ordered for us, will take you back first.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham, on
quick deliberation, dressed, though not perhaps with full lucidity, and
by seven o’clock was in Portland Place, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) friend, <div class="bookquote">``upstairs''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>and described to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) arrival as herself engaged in dressing,
instantly received her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) knew on the spot, poor Fanny, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
afterwards to declare to the Colonel, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feared crisis had popped
up as at the touch of a spring, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) impossible hour was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) impossible hour was the hour of its coming out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had known
of old so much more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had ever said; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had often put it to
herself, in apprehension, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tried to think even in preparation, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should recognise the approach of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doom by a consciousness akin to
that of the blowing open of a window on some night of the highest wind
and the lowest thermometer. It would be all in vain to have crouched so
long by the fire; the glass would have been smashed, the icy air would
fill the place. If the air in Maggie's room then, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) going up, was
not, as yet, quite the polar blast she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had expected, it was distinctly,
none the less, such an atmosphere as they had not hitherto breathed
together. The Princess, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) perceived, was completely dressed--that
business was over; it added indeed to the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) importantly
awaiting the assistance she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had summoned, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) showing a deck
cleared, so to speak, for action. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) maid had already left her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) presented herself, in the large, clear room, where everything was
admirable, but where nothing was out of place, as, for the first time in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) life rather <div class="bookquote">``bedizened.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Was it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had put on too many things,
overcharged herself with jewels, wore in particular more of them than
usual, and bigger ones, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hair?--a question her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) visitor presently
answered by attributing this appearance largely to the bright red spot,
red as some monstrous ruby, that burned in either of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) cheeks. These
two items of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) aspect had, promptly enough, their own light for
Mrs. Assingham, who made out by it that nothing more pathetic could be
imagined than the refuge and disguise her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) agitation had instinctively
asked of the arts of dress, multiplied to extravagance, almost to
incoherence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had had, visibly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) idea--that of not betraying
herself by inattentions into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had never yet fallen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
stood there circled about and furnished forth, as always, in a manner
that testified to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) perfect little personal processes. It had ever
been her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was, for all occasions, FOUND ready, without
loose ends or exposed accessories or unremoved superfluities; a
suggestion of the swept and garnished, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) whole splendid, yet
thereby more or less encumbered and embroidered setting, that reflected
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) small still passion for order and symmetry, for objects with their
backs to the walls, and spoke even of some probable reference, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
American blood, to dusting and polishing New England grandmothers. If
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) apartment was <div class="bookquote">``princely,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in the clearness of the lingering day,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had been carried there prepared, all attired and
decorated, like some holy image in a procession, and left, precisely,
to show what wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could work under pressure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) friend felt--how
could she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) not?--as the truly pious priest might feel when confronted,
behind the altar, before the festa, with his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) miraculous Madonna. Such
an occasion would be grave, in general, with all the gravity of what he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
might look for. But the gravity to-night would be of the rarest; what he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
might look for would depend so on what he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) could give.



<p/>XXXIII

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something very strange has happened, and I think you ought to know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie spoke this indeed without extravagance, yet with the effect of
making her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) guest measure anew the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) appeal. It was their
definite understanding: whatever Fanny knew Fanny's faith would provide
for. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew, accordingly, at the end of five minutes, what the
extraordinary, in the late occurrence, had consisted of, and how it had
all come of Maggie's achieved hour, under Mr. Crichton's protection, at
the Museum. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>) had desired, Mr. Crichton, with characteristic kindness,
after the wonderful show, after offered luncheon at his (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>) incorporated
lodge hard by, to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) safely home; especially on his (<font color='blue'><b>Crichton</b></font>) noting, in
attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to the great steps, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) carriage;
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done, really, just for the harmless amusement of taking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had known she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should find herself, as the consequence
of such an hour, in a sort of exalted state, under the influence of
which a walk through the London streets would be exactly what would suit
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) best; an independent ramble, impressed, excited, contented, with
nothing to mind and nobody to talk to, and shop-windows in plenty
to look at if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) liked: a low taste, of the essence, it was to be
supposed, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) nature, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had of late, for so many reasons, been
unable to gratify. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) leave, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thanks--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way quite enough; it being also sufficiently the case that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
even a shy hope of not going too straight. To wander a little wild was
what would truly amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); so that, keeping clear of Oxford Street and
cultivating an impression as of parts she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had ended
with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had more or less had been fancying, an encounter with
three or four shops--an old bookseller's, an old printmonger's, a couple
of places with dim antiquities in the window--that were not as so many
of the other shops, those in Sloane Street, say; a hollow parade which
had long since ceased to beguile. There had remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) moreover
an allusion of Charlotte's, of some months before--seed dropped into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagination in the form of a casual speech about there being in
Bloomsbury such <div class="bookquote">``funny little fascinating''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>places and even sometimes
such unexpected finds. There could perhaps have been no stronger mark
than this sense of well-nigh romantic opportunity--no livelier sign of
the impression made on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and always so long retained, so watchfully
nursed, by any observation of Charlotte's, however lightly thrown off.
And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had felt, somehow, more at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ease than for months and
months before; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't know why, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) time at the Museum, oddly,
had done it; it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hadn't come into so many noble and
beautiful associations, nor secured them also for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) boy, secured them
even for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father, only to see them turn to vanity and doubt, turn
possibly to something still worse. <div class="bookquote">``I believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) again as much as
ever, and I felt how I believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said with bright, fixed
eyes; <div class="bookquote">``I felt it in the streets as I walked along, and it was as if that
helped me and lifted me up, my being off by myself there, not having,
for the moment, to wonder and watch; having, on the contrary, almost
nothing on my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was so much as if everything would come out right that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had fallen
to thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father's birthday, had given herself this as a reason
for trying what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could pick up for it. They would keep it at Fawns,
where they had kept it before--since it would be the twenty-first of the
month; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mightn't have another chance of making sure of something
to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). There was always the impossibility, of course, of finding
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) anything, the least bit <div class="bookquote">``good,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wouldn't already, long ago,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rummagings, have seen himself--and only not to think a quarter
good enough; this, however, was an old story, and one could not have had
any fun with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) but for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sweet theory that the individual gift, the
friendship's offering, was, by a rigorous law of nature, a foredoomed
aberration, and that the more it was so the more it showed, and the more
one cherished it for showing, how friendly it had been. The infirmity
of art was the candour of affection, the grossness of pedigree the
refinement of sympathy; the ugliest objects, in fact, as a general
thing, were the bravest, the tenderest mementos, and, as such, figured
in glass cases apart, worthy doubtless of the home, but not worthy of
the temple--dedicated to the grimacing, not to the clear-faced, gods.
She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) herself, naturally, through the past years, had come to be much
represented in those receptacles; against the thick, locked panes of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) still liked to flatten her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nose, finding in its place, each
time, everything she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had on successive anniversaries tried to believe he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>)
might pretend, at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) suggestion, to be put off with, or at least think
curious. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was now ready to try it again: they had always, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) pleasure in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pretence and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>), with the funny
betrayal of the sacrifice to domestic manners on either side, played
the game so happily. To this end, on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) way home, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had loitered
everywhere; quite too deludedly among the old books and the old
prints, which had yielded nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) purpose, but with a strange
inconsequence in one of the other shops, that of a small antiquarian,
a queer little foreign man, who had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a number of things,
shown her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) finally something that, struck with it as rather a rarity and
thinking it would, compared to some of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ventures, quite superlatively
do, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had bought--bought really, when it came to that, for a price.
<div class="bookquote">``It appears now it won't do at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``something has
happened since that puts it quite out of the question. I had only my day
of satisfaction in it, but I feel, at the same time, as I keep it here
before me, that I wouldn't have missed it for the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had talked, from the first of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend's entrances coherently
enough, even with a small quaver that overstated her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) calm; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) breath every few seconds, as if for deliberation and to prove she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
didn't pant--all of which marked for Fanny the depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) commotion:
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father, about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) chance to
pick up something that might divert him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mention, in fine, of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
fortitude under presents, having meanwhile, naturally, it should be
said, much less an amplitude of insistence on the speaker's lips than a
power to produce on the part of the listener herself the prompt
response and full comprehension of memory and sympathy, of old amused
observation. The picture was filled out by the latter's fond fancy. But
Maggie was at any rate under arms; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was doing and
had already her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) plan--a plan for making, for allowing, as yet, <div class="bookquote">``no
difference'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; in accordance with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would still dine out, and
not with red eyes, nor convulsed features, nor neglected items of
appearance, nor anything that would raise a question. Yet there was some
knowledge that, exactly to this support of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) not breaking down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
desired, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) required, possession of; and, with the sinister rise
and fall of lightning unaccompanied by thunder, it played before Mrs.
Assingham's eyes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) herself should have, at whatever risk or
whatever cost, to supply her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) with the stuff of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) need. All our
friend's instinct was to hold off from this till she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) should see what the
ground would bear; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) would take no step nearer unless INTELLIGIBLY to
meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), and, awkward though it might be to hover there only pale and
distorted, with mere imbecilities of vagueness, there was a quality of
bald help in the fact of not as yet guessing what such an ominous start
could lead to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) caught, however, after a second's thought, at the
Princess's allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) lost reassurance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean you were so at your ease on Monday--the night you dined with
us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was very happy then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--we thought you so gay and so brilliant.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny felt it feeble, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``We were so glad you were happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie stood a moment, at first only looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You thought me all
right, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, dearest; we thought you all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I daresay it was natural; but in point of fact I never was more
wrong in my life. For, all the while, if you please, this was brewing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham indulged, as nearly as possible to luxury, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) vagueness.
```This'--?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THAT!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess eyes</b></font>)</div>replied the Princess, whose eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) companion now saw, had
turned to an object on the chimney-piece of the room, of which, among
so many precious objects--the Ververs, wherever they might be, always
revelled peculiarly in matchless old mantel ornaments--her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) visitor had
not taken heed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean the gilt cup?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean the gilt cup.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>The piece now recognised by Fanny as new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own vision was a
capacious bowl, of old-looking, rather strikingly yellow gold, mounted,
by a short stem, on an ample foot, which held a central position above
the fire-place, where, to allow it the better to show, a clearance
had been made of other objects, notably of the Louis-Seize clock that
accompanied the candelabra. This latter trophy ticked at present on the
marble slab of a commode that exactly matched it in splendour and style.
Mrs. Assingham took it, the bowl, as a fine thing; but the question was
obviously not of its intrinsic value, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) kept off from it, admiring
it at a distance. <div class="bookquote">``But what has that to do--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has everything. You'll see.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>With which again, however, for
the moment, Maggie attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) strange wide eyes. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
before--before I had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>```He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)' knew--?'' But Fanny, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cast about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) for the links she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
missed, could only echo it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amerigo knew Charlotte--more than I ever dreamed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny felt then it was stare for stare. <div class="bookquote">``But surely you always knew they
had met.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't understand. I knew too little. Don't you see what I mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the
Princess asked.

<p/>Mrs. Assingham wondered, during these instants, how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) even now
knew; it had taken a minute to perceive how gently she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was speaking.
With that perception of its being no challenge of wrath, no heat of
the deceived soul, but only a free exposure of the completeness of past
ignorance, inviting derision even if it must, the elder woman felt,
first, a strange, barely credible relief: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew in, as if it had been
the warm summer scent of a flower, the sweet certainty of not meeting,
any way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should turn, any consequence of judgment. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shouldn't be
judged--save by herself; which was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own wretched business. The next
moment, however, at all events, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) blushed, within, for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) immediate
cowardice: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had thought of herself, thought of <div class="bookquote">``getting off,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>before
so much as thinking--that is of pitifully seeing--that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in
presence of an appeal that was ALL an appeal, that utterly accepted its
necessity. <div class="bookquote">``In a general way, dear child, yes. But not--a--in connexion
with what you've been telling me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were intimate, you see. Intimate,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess.

<p/>Fanny continued to face her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), taking from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) excited eyes this history,
so dim and faint for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) anxious emphasis, of the far-away other
time. <div class="bookquote">``There's always the question of what one considers--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What one considers intimate? Well, I know what I consider intimate now.
Too intimate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``to let me know anything about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>It was quiet--yes; but not too quiet for Fanny Assingham's capacity to
wince. <div class="bookquote">``Only compatible with letting ME, you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had asked it
after a pause, but turning again to the new ornament of the chimney
and wondering, even while she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) took relief from it, at this gap in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
experience. <div class="bookquote">``But here are things, my dear, of which my ignorance is
perfect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They went about together--they're known to have done it. And I don't
mean only before--I mean after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before we were married--yes; but after we were engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I've known nothing about that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) said it with a braver
assurance--clutching, with comfort, at something that was apparently new
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That bowl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie went on, <div class="bookquote">``is, so strangely--too strangely, almost,
to believe at this time of day--the proof. They were together all the
while--up to the very eve of our marriage. Don't you remember how just
before that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came back, so unexpectedly, from America?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>The question had for Mrs. Assingham--and whether all consciously
or not--the oddest pathos of simplicity. <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, dear, of course I
remember how she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came back from America--and how she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stayed with US, and
what view one had of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's eyes still, all the time, pressed and penetrated; so that,
during a moment, just here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have given the little flare, have
made the little pounce, of asking what then <div class="bookquote">``one's''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>view had been. To
the small flash of this eruption Fanny stood, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) minute, wittingly
exposed; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw it as quickly cease to threaten--quite saw the
Princess, even though in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) pain, refuse, in the interest of their
strange and exalted bargain, to take advantage of the opportunity
for planting the stab of reproach, the opportunity thus coming all of
itself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)--or she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)--look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) chance
for straight denunciation, look at it and then pass it by; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) felt
herself, with this fact, hushed well-nigh to awe at the lucid higher
intention that no distress could confound and that no discovery--since
it was, however obscurely, a case of <div class="bookquote">``discovery'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--could make less
needful. These seconds were brief--they rapidly passed; but they
lasted long enough to renew our friend's sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) own extraordinary
undertaking, the function again imposed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), the answerability again
drilled into her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), by this intensity of intimation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was reminded of
the terms on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was let off--her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) quantity of release having made
its sufficient show in that recall of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) relation to Charlotte's
old reappearance; and deep within the whole impression glowed--ah, so
inspiringly when it came to that! her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) steady view, clear from the first,
of the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) companion's motive. It was like a fresh sacrifice
for a larger conquest <div class="bookquote">``Only see me through now, do it in the face of
this and in spite of it, and I leave you a hand of which the freedom
isn't to be said!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>The aggravation of fear--or call it, apparently, of
knowledge--had jumped straight into its place as an aggravation above
all for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father; the effect of this being but to quicken to passion
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) reasons for making his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) protectedness, or in other words the forms
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ignorance, still the law of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) attitude and the key to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
solution. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) kept as tight hold of these reasons and these forms, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) confirmed horror, as the rider of a plunging horse grasps his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) seat
with his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) knees; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) might absolutely have been putting it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
guest that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) could stay on if they should only <div class="bookquote">``meet''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>nothing more. Though ignorant still of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had definitely met Fanny
yearned, within, over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirit; and so, no word about it said, passed,
through mere pitying eyes, a vow to walk ahead and, at crossroads, with
a lantern for the darkness and wavings away for unadvised traffic, look
out for alarms. There was accordingly no wait in Maggie's reply. <div class="bookquote">``They
spent together hours--spent at least a morning--the certainty of which
has come back to me now, but that I didn't dream of it at the time. That
cup there has turned witness--by the most wonderful of chances. That's
why, since it has been here, I've stood it out for my husband to see;
put it where it would meet him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), almost immediately, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should come
into the room. I've wanted it to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``and I've
wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to meet it, and to be myself present at the meeting. But that
hasn't taken place as yet; often as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has lately been in the way of
coming to see me here--yes, in particular lately--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hasn't showed
to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) managed quietness, more and more, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
talked--an achieved coherence that helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), evidently, to hear and
to watch herself; there was support, and thereby an awful harmony, but
which meant a further guidance, in the facts she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could add together.
<div class="bookquote">``It's quite as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had an instinct--something that has warned him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) off
or made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) uneasy. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) doesn't quite know, naturally, what has happened,
but guesses, with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) beautiful cleverness, that something has, and
isn't in a hurry to be confronted with it. So, in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) vague fear, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
keeps off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But being meanwhile in the house--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no idea--not having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to-day, by exception, since before
luncheon. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke to me then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess freely explained, <div class="bookquote">``of a
ballot, of great importance, at a club--for somebody, some personal
friend, I think, who's coming up and is supposed to be in danger. To
make an effort for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had better lunch there. You see the
efforts he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) can make'' (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>--for which Maggie found a smile that went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
friend's heart. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s in so many ways the kindest of men. But it was
hours ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham thought. <div class="bookquote">``The more danger then of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) coming in and
finding me here. I don't know, you see, what you now consider that
you've ascertained; nor anything of the connexion with it of that object
that you declare so damning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) eyes rested on this odd acquisition
and then quitted it, went back to it and again turned from it: it was
inscrutable in its rather stupid elegance, and yet, from the moment
one had thus appraised it, vivid and definite in its domination of
the scene. Fanny could no more overlook it now than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have
overlooked a lighted Christmas-tree; but nervously and all in vain she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
dipped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind for some floating reminiscence of it. At the same
time that this attempt left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) blank she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) understood a good deal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
even not a little shared the Prince's mystic apprehension. The golden
bowl put on, under consideration, a sturdy, a conscious perversity; as
a <div class="bookquote">``document,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>somehow, it was ugly, though it might have a decorative
grace. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) finding me here in presence of it might be more flagrantly
disagreeable--for all of us--than you intend or than would necessarily
help us. And I must take time, truly, to understand what it means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're safe, as far as that goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie returned; <div class="bookquote">``you may take it
from me that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) won't come in; and that I shall only find him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) below,
waiting for me, when I go down to the carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny Assingham took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), took it and more. <div class="bookquote">``We're to sit
together at the Ambassador's then--or at least you two are--with this
new complication thrust up before you, all unexplained; and to look
at each other with faces that pretend, for the ghastly hour, not to be
seeing it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie looked at HER with a face that might have been the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
preparing. ```Unexplained,' my dear? Quite the contrary--explained:
fully, intensely, admirably explained, with nothing really to add. My
own love''--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept it up--<div class="bookquote">``I don't want anything more. I've plenty to
go upon and to do with, as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny Assingham stood there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) comparative darkness, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) links,
verily, still missing; but the most acceptable effect of this was,
singularly, as yet, a cold fear of getting nearer the fact. <div class="bookquote">``But when
you come home--? I mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>)'ll come up with you again. Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) see it
then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>On which Maggie gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), after an instant's visible thought, the
strangest of slow headshakes. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>)'ll never see
it--if it only stands there waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) may never again,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said
the Princess, <div class="bookquote">``come into this room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny more deeply wondered, <div class="bookquote">``Never again? Oh--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it may be. How do I know? With THIS!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) quietly went on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
not looked again at the incriminating piece, but there was a marvel to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) friend in the way the little word representing it seemed to express
and include for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) situation. <div class="bookquote">``Then you intend not to
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>)--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie waited. <div class="bookquote">``To `speak'--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, about your having it and about what you consider that it
represents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know that I shall speak--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) doesn't. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) keeping
away from me because of that--what will that be but to speak? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>)
can't say or do more. It won't be for me to speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie added in
a different tone, one of the tones that had already so penetrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
guest. <div class="bookquote">``It will be for me to listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham turned it over. <div class="bookquote">``Then it all depends on that object that
you regard, for your reasons, as evidence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I may say that _I_ depend on it. I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``treat
it as nothing now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham, at this, went closer to the cup on the chimney--quite
liking to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) did so, moreover, without going closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
companion's vision. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) looked at the precious thing--if precious it
was--found herself in fact eyeing it as if, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) dim solicitation, to
draw its secret from it rather than suffer the imposition of Maggie's
knowledge. It was brave and rich and firm, with its bold deep hollow;
and, without this queer torment about it, would, thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) love of
plenty of yellow, figure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as an enviable ornament, a possession
really desirable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't touch it, but if after a minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned
away from it the reason was, rather oddly and suddenly, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fear of
doing so. <div class="bookquote">``Then it all depends on the bowl? I mean your future does? For
that's what it comes to, I judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What it comes to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie presently returned, <div class="bookquote">``is what that thing has
put me, so almost miraculously, in the way of learning: how far they
had originally gone together. If there was so much between them before,
there can't--with all the other appearances--not be a great deal more
now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on and on; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) steadily made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) points. <div class="bookquote">``If such
things were already then between them they make all the difference for
possible doubt of what may have been between them since. If there had
been nothing before there might be explanations. But it makes to-day too
much to explain. I mean to explain away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said.

<p/>Fanny Assingham was there to explain away--of this she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was duly
conscious; for that at least had been true up to now. In the light,
however, of Maggie's demonstration the quantity, even without her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) taking
as yet a more exact measure, might well seem larger than ever. Besides
which, with or without exactness, the effect of each successive minute
in the place was to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) more in presence of what Maggie herself saw.
Maggie herself saw the truth, and that was really, while they remained
there together, enough for Mrs. Assingham's relation to it. There was
a force in the Princess's mere manner about it that made the detail of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) knew a matter of minor importance. Fanny had in fact something
like a momentary shame over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own need of asking for this detail.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't pretend to repudiate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said after a little, <div class="bookquote">``my own
impressions of the different times I suppose you speak of; any more,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``than I can forget what difficulties and, as it constantly
seemed to me, what dangers, every course of action--whatever I should
decide upon--made for me. I tried, I tried hard, to act for the best.
And, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) next pursued, while, at the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own
statement, a slow courage and even a faint warmth of conviction came
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``and, you know, I believe it's what I shall turn out to
have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This produced a minute during which their interchange, though quickened
and deepened, was that of silence only, and the long, charged look; all
of which found virtual consecration when Maggie at last spoke. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure
you tried to act for the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>It kept Fanny Assingham again a minute in silence. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought,
dearest, you weren't an angel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Not, however, that this alone was much help! <div class="bookquote">``It was up to the very eve,
you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess went on--<div class="bookquote">``up to within two or three days of our
marriage. That, THAT, you know--!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) broke down for strangely
smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, as I say, it was while she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was with me. But I didn't know it. That
is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know of anything in particular.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>It
sounded weak--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) felt; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had really her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) point to make. <div class="bookquote">``What
I mean is that I don't know, for knowledge, now, anything I didn't then.
That's how I am.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) still, however, floundered. <div class="bookquote">``I mean it's how I
WAS.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't they, how you were and how you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie asked, <div class="bookquote">``come
practically to the same thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>The elder woman's words had struck
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own ear as in the tone, now mistimed, of their recent, but all too
factitious understanding, arrived at in hours when, as there was nothing
susceptible of proof, there was nothing definitely to disprove. The
situation had changed by--well, by whatever there was, by the outbreak
of the definite; and this could keep Maggie at least firm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was firm
enough as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pursued. <div class="bookquote">``It was ON the whole thing that Amerigo married
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes had their turn again at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) damnatory piece.
<div class="bookquote">``And it was on that--it was on that!''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>But they came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) visitor.
<div class="bookquote">``And it was on it all that father married HER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) visitor took it as might be. <div class="bookquote">``They both married--ah, that you must
believe!--with the highest intentions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father did certainly!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And then, at the renewal of this consciousness,
it all rolled over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ah, to thrust such things on us, to do them
here between us and with us, day after day, and in return, in return--!
To do it to HIM--to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``You mean it's for him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) you most suffer?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>And then
as the Princess, after a look, but turned away, moving about the
room--which made the question somehow seem a blunder--<div class="bookquote">``I ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``because I think everything, everything we now speak of, may
be for him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), really may be MADE for him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), quite as if it hadn't been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But Maggie had, the next moment faced about as if without hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Father did it for ME--did it all and only for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham, with a certain promptness, threw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) head; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
faltered again before she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Well--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>It was only an intended word, but Maggie showed after an instant that
it had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that that's the reason, that that's A
reason--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny at first, however, feeling the response in this, didn't say all
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) meant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said for the moment something else instead. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) did it
for you--largely at least for you. And it was for you that I did, in
my smaller, interested way--well, what I could do. For I could do
something,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``I thought I saw your interest as he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) himself
saw it. And I thought I saw Charlotte's. I believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And _I_ believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/>Mrs. Assingham waited again; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) presently pushed on. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) believed
then in herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie murmured.

<p/>Something exquisite, faintly eager, in the prompt simplicity of it,
supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend further. <div class="bookquote">``And the Prince believed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) belief was
real. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) believed in himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie spent a minute in taking it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) believed in himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as I too believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). For I absolutely did, Maggie.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>To
which Fanny then added: <div class="bookquote">``And I believe in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) yet. I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
subjoined--<div class="bookquote">``well, I mean I DO.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie again took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); after which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was again, restlessly,
set afloat. Then when this had come to an end: <div class="bookquote">``And do you believe in
Charlotte yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham had a demur that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could now afford. <div class="bookquote">``We'll
talk of Charlotte some other day. They both, at any rate, thought
themselves safe at the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why did they keep from me everything I might have known?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) friend bent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) the mildest eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Why did I myself keep it
from you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you weren't, for honour, obliged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the poor woman broke out on this, <div class="bookquote">``you ARE divine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They pretended to love me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess went on. <div class="bookquote">``And they pretended
to love HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray what was there that I didn't pretend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not, at any rate, to care for me as you cared for Amerigo and for
Charlotte. They were much more interesting--it was perfectly natural.
How couldn't you like Amerigo?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie continued.

<p/>Mrs. Assingham gave it up. <div class="bookquote">``How couldn't I, how couldn't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then, with
a fine freedom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way. <div class="bookquote">``How CAN'T I, how can't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>It fixed afresh Maggie's wide eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I see--I see. Well, it's
beautiful for you to be able to. And of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``you wanted
to help Charlotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'' (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>--Fanny considered it--<div class="bookquote">``I wanted to help Charlotte. But I wanted
also, you see, to help you--by not digging up a past that I believed,
with so much on top of it, solidly buried. I wanted, as I still want,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) richly declared, <div class="bookquote">``to help every one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It set Maggie once more in movement--movement which, however, spent
itself again with a quick emphasis. <div class="bookquote">``Then it's a good deal my fault--if
everything really began so well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny Assingham met it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">``You've been only too perfect.
You've thought only too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>But the Princess had already caught at the words. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--I've thought
only too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) appeared to continue, for the minute, full of
that fault. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had it in fact, by this prompted thought, all before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), dear man, of HIM--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) friend, able to take in thus directly her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father,
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) with a new suspense. THAT way might safety lie--it was like
a wider chink of light. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) believed--with a beauty!--in Charlotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and it was I who had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) believe. I didn't mean to, at the
time, so much; for I had no idea then of what was coming. But I did it,
I did it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With a beauty--ah, with a beauty, you too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham insisted.

<p/>Maggie, however, was seeing for herself--it was another matter, <div class="bookquote">``The
thing was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) think it would be so possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny again hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``The Prince made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) think--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie stared--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had meant her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) vision seemed to
spread. <div class="bookquote">``They both made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) think. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wouldn't have thought without
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet Amerigo's good faith,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham insisted, <div class="bookquote">``was perfect. And
there was nothing, all the more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``against your father's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The remark, however, kept Maggie for a moment still. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing perhaps
but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Knew'?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was doing it, so much, for me. To what extent,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) suddenly
asked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend, <div class="bookquote">``do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, who can say what passes between people in such a relation? The only
thing one can be sure of is that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was generous.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Assingham
conclusively smiled. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doubtless knew as much as was right for
himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As much, that is, as was right for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes then--as was right for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). The point is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny declared, <div class="bookquote">``that,
whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knowledge, it made, all the way it went, for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) good
faith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie continued to gaze, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend now fairly waited on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
successive movements. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't the point, very considerably, that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) good
faith must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) faith in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) taking almost as much interest in
me as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) himself took?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny Assingham thought. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) recognised, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) adopted, your long
friendship. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) founded on it no selfishness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie with still deeper consideration: <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) counted her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
selfishness out almost as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) counted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you may say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie went on; <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had none of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>),
may have expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) side, to have as little. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) may only
since have found that out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham looked blank. <div class="bookquote">``Since--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may have become aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie pursued, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has found
it out. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has taken the measure, since their marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
explained, <div class="bookquote">``of how much he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had asked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--more, say, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
understood at the time. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may have made out at last how such a demand
was, in the long run, to affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may have done many things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham responded; <div class="bookquote">``but there's
one thing he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) certainly won't have done. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll never have shown that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
expected of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a quarter as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must have understood he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was to
give.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've often wondered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie mused, <div class="bookquote">``what Charlotte really understood.
But it's one of the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has never told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then as it's one of the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has never told me either, we shall
probably never know it; and we may regard it as none of our business.
There are many things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham, <div class="bookquote">``that we shall never know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie took it in with a long reflection. <div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there are others,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend went on, <div class="bookquote">``that stare us in the face
and that--under whatever difficulty you may feel you labour--may now be
enough for us. Your father has been extraordinary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>It had been as if Maggie were feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rallied to this
with a rush. <div class="bookquote">``Extraordinary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Magnificent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion held tight to it. <div class="bookquote">``Magnificent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll do for himself whatever there may be to do. What he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
undertook for you he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll do to the end. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't undertake it to break
down; in what--quiet, patient, exquisite as he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) is--did he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) ever break
down? He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) life proposed to himself to have failed, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) won't have done it on this occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, this occasion!'' (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>--and Maggie's wail showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), of a sudden, thrown
back on it. <div class="bookquote">``Am I in the least sure that, with everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) even knows
what it is? And yet am I in the least sure he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) doesn't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) doesn't then, so much the better. Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean give him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave HER,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny Assingham went on. <div class="bookquote">``Leave her (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) TO him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) darkly. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean leave him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) to HER? After this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After everything. Aren't they, for that matter, intimately together
now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Intimately'--? How do I know?''

<p/>But Fanny kept it up. <div class="bookquote">``Aren't you and your husband--in spite of
everything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie's eyes still further, if possible, dilated. <div class="bookquote">``It remains to be
seen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you're not then, where's your faith?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In my husband--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham but for an instant hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``In your father. It all
comes back to that. Rest on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ignorance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny met it again. <div class="bookquote">``On whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may offer you. TAKE that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie stared.

<p/>Mrs. Assingham held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``And be grateful.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>On which, for a
minute, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) let the Princess face her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there you are.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>But Maggie had turned away, moving to the window,
as if still to keep something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face from sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood there
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes on the street while Mrs. Assingham's reverted to that
complicating object on the chimney as to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) condition, so
oddly even to herself, was that both of recurrent wonder and recurrent
protest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) went over it, looked at it afresh and yielded now to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
impulse to feel it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) laid them on it, lifting it up, and
was surprised, thus, with the weight of it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had seldom handled so
much massive gold. That effect itself somehow prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) to further
freedom and presently to saying: <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe in this, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It brought Maggie round to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't believe in it? You will when I
tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, tell me nothing! I won't have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) kept
the cup in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) hand, held it there in a manner that gave Maggie's
attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw the next moment, a quality of excited
suspense. This suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), oddly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had, with the liberty
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was taking, an air of intention, and the impression betrayed by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion's eyes grew more distinct in a word of warning. <div class="bookquote">``It's of
value, but its value's impaired, I've learned, by a crack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A crack?--in the gold--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't gold.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>With which, somewhat strangely, Maggie smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's glass--and cracked, under the gilt, as I say, at that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glass?--of this weight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``it's crystal--and was once, I suppose, precious.
But what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) then asked, <div class="bookquote">``do you mean to do with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had come away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) window, one of the three by which the wide
room, enjoying an advantageous <div class="bookquote">``back,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>commanded the western sky and
caught a glimpse of the evening flush; while Mrs. Assingham, possessed
of the bowl, and possessed too of this indication of a flaw, approached
another for the benefit of the slowly-fading light. Here, thumbing the
singular piece, weighing it, turning it over, and growing suddenly more
conscious, above all, of an irresistible impulse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) presently spoke
again. <div class="bookquote">``A crack? Then your whole idea has a crack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, by this time at some distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), waited a moment. <div class="bookquote">``If you
mean by my idea the knowledge that has come to me THAT--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>But Fanny, with decision, had already taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``There's only one
knowledge that concerns us--one fact with which we can have anything to
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which one, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact that your husband has never, never, never--!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But the very
gravity of this statement, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) friend
across the room, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) for an instant hang fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, never what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never been half so interested in you as now. But don't you, my dear,
really feel it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie considered. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I think what I've told you helps me to feel it.
His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) having to-day given up even his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) forms; his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) keeping away from me; his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
not having come.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head as against all easy glosses.
<div class="bookquote">``It is because of that, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, if it's because of this--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>And Fanny Assingham, who had
been casting about her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) and whose inspiration decidedly had come, raised
the cup in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) two hands, raised it positively above her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) head, and from
under it, solemnly, smiled at the Princess as a signal of intention.
So for an instant, full of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) thought and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) act, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) held the
precious vessel, and then, with due note taken of the margin of the
polished floor, bare, fine and hard in the embrasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
dashed it boldly to the ground, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had the thrill of seeing it,
with the violence of the crash, lie shattered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had flushed with the
force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) effort, as Maggie had flushed with wonder at the sight, and
this high reflection in their faces was all that passed between them for
a minute more. After which, <div class="bookquote">``Whatever you meant by it--and I don't want
to know NOW--has ceased to exist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what in the world, my dear, did you mean by it?'' (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>--that sound, as at
the touch of a spring, rang out as the first effect of Fanny's speech.
It broke upon the two women's absorption with a sharpness almost equal
to the smash of the crystal, for the door of the room had been opened
by the Prince without their taking heed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had apparently had time,
moreover, to catch the conclusion of Fanny's act; his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes attached
themselves, through the large space allowing just there, as happened,
a free view, to the shining fragments at this lady's feet. His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) question
had been addressed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes immediately
afterwards to those of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) visitor, whose own then held them in a
manner of which neither party had been capable, doubtless, for mute
penetration, since the hour spent by him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in Cadogan Place on the eve of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) marriage and the afternoon of Charlotte's reappearance. Something
now again became possible for these communicants, under the intensity
of their pressure, something that took up that tale and that might
have been a redemption of pledges then exchanged. This rapid play of
suppressed appeal and disguised response lasted indeed long enough for
more results than one--long enough for Mrs. Assingham to measure the
feat of quick self-recovery, possibly therefore of recognition still
more immediate, accompanying Amerigo's vision and estimate of the
evidence with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had been--so admirably, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) felt as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)--inspired to deal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)--there
were so many things she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wanted, on the spot, to say. But Maggie was
looking too--and was moreover looking at them both; so that these
things, for the elder woman, quickly enough reduced themselves to one.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) question--not too late, since, in their silence, it had
remained in the air. Gathering herself to go, leaving the golden bowl
split into three pieces on the ground, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) simply referred him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should see them later, they would all meet soon again; and
meanwhile, as to what Maggie had meant--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turn, from the
door--why, Maggie herself was doubtless by this time ready to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>).




<p/>XXXIV

<p/>Left with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband, Maggie, however, for the time, said nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
only felt, on the spot, a strong, sharp wish not to see his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face again
till he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should have had a minute to arrange it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had seen it enough
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) temporary clearness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) next movement--seen it as it showed
during the stare of surprise that followed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) entrance. Then it was
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew how hugely expert she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been made, for judging it
quickly, by that vision of it, indelibly registered for reference, that
had flashed a light into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) troubled soul the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) late return
from Matcham. The expression worn by it at that juncture, for however
few instants, had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a sense of its possibilities, one of the
most relevant of which might have been playing up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), before
the consummation of Fanny Assingham's retreat, just long enough to
be recognised. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had recognised in it was HIS (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) recognition,
the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) having been forced, by the flush of their visitor's
attitude and the unextinguished report of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) words, to take account
of the flagrant signs of the accident, of the incident, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had unexpectedly dropped. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had, not unnaturally, failed to see this
occurrence represented by the three fragments of an object apparently
valuable which lay there on the floor and which, even across the width
of the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) kept interval, reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), unmistakably though
confusedly, of something known, some other unforgotten image. That was a
mere shock, that was a pain--as if Fanny's violence had been a violence
redoubled and acting beyond its intention, a violence calling up the hot
blood as a blow across the mouth might have called it. Maggie knew as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't want his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pain; what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own simple certainty--not the red mark of conviction flaming
there in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) beauty. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could have gone on with bandaged eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
would have liked that best; if it were a question of saying what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
now, apparently, should have to, and of taking from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would
say, any blindness that might wrap it would be the nearest approach to a
boon.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went in silence to where her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend--never, in intention, visibly,
so much her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend as at that moment--had braced herself to so amazing
an energy, and there, under Amerigo's eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) picked up the shining
pieces. Bedizened and jewelled, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rustling finery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) paid,
with humility of attitude, this prompt tribute to order--only to find,
however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could carry but two of the fragments at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
brought them over to the chimney-piece, to the conspicuous place
occupied by the cup before Fanny's appropriation of it, and, after
laying them carefully down, went back for what remained, the solid
detached foot. With this she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) returned to the mantel-shelf, placing
it with deliberation in the centre and then, for a minute, occupying
herself as with the attempt to fit the other morsels together. The
split, determined by the latent crack, was so sharp and so neat that if
there had been anything to hold them the bowl might still, quite
beautifully, a few steps away, have passed for uninjured. But, as there
was, naturally, nothing to hold them but Maggie's hands, during the few
moments the latter were so employed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could only lay the almost equal
parts of the vessel carefully beside their pedestal and leave them thus
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband's eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had proceeded without words, but quite as
if with a sought effect-in spite of which it had all seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to
take a far longer time than anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had ever so quickly
accomplished. Amerigo said nothing either-though it was true that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
silence had the gloss of the warning she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doubtless appeared to admonish
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to take: it was as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) manner hushed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to the proper
observation of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should have no doubt of it
whatever: she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) _knew_ and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) broken bowl was proof that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew-yet the
least part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) desire was to make him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) waste words. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have to
think-this she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew even better still; and all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was for the present
concerned with was that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should be aware. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for aware
all day, or at least for obscurely and instinctively anxious-as to that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had just committed herself to Fanny Assingham; but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had been
wrong about was the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) anxiety. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fear of staying away, as
a marked symptom, had at least proved greater than his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fear of coming in
; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had come in even at the risk of bringing it with him-and, ah, what
more did she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) require now than her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) sense, established within the first
minute or two, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had brought it, however he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might be steadying
himself against dangers of betrayal by some wrong word, and that it was
shut in there between them, the successive moments throbbing under it
the while as the pulse of fever throbs under the doctor's thumb?

<p/>Maggie's sense, in fine, in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) presence, was that though the bowl had been
broken, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) reason hadn't ; the reason for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind,
the reason for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had summoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend, the reason for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had prepared the place for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband's eyes ; it was all one reason, and,
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) intense little clutch held the matter, what had happened by Fanny's
act and by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) apprehension of it had not in the least happened to
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ but absolutely and directly to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must proceed to
take in. There it was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wish for time interposed-time for Amerigo's
use, not for hers, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), for ever so long now, for hours and hours as
they seemed, had been living with eternity; with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would continue to
live. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanted to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`` Take it, take it, take all you need of it
; arrange yourself so as to suffer least, or to be, at any rate, least
distorted and disfigured Only _see_ see that _I_ see, and make
up your mind, on this new basis, at your convenience. Wait-it won't be
long-till you can confer again with Charlotte, for you'll do it much better
then-more easily to both of us. Above all don't show me, till you've got it
well under, the dreadful blur, the ravage of suspense and embarrassment,
produced, and produced by my doing, in your personal serenity, your
incomparable superiority.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>After she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had squared again her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) little objects on the chimney, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
within an ace, in fact, of turning on him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with that appeal; besides its
being lucid for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), all the while, that the occasion was passing, that
they were dining out, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wasn't dressed, and that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
herself was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was yet, in all probability, so horribly red in the
face and so awry, in many ways, with agitation, that in view of the
Ambassador's company, of possible comments and constructions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should
need, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) glass, some restoration of appearances.

<p/>Amerigo, meanwhile, after all, could clearly make the most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
having enjoined on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) to wait--suggested it by the positive pomp of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dealings with the smashed cup; to wait, that is, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should
pronounce as Mrs. Assingham had promised for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). This delay, again,
certainly tested her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) presence of mind--though that strain was not
what presently made her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) speak. Keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) eyes, for the time, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
husband's as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) might, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) soon found herself much more drivingly
conscious of the strain on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own wit. There was even a minute,
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) back was turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) knew once more the
strangeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) desire to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), a strangeness that had already,
fifty times, brushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), in the depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) trouble, as with the
wild wing of some bird of the air who might blindly have swooped for
an instant into the shaft of a well, darkening there by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) momentary
flutter the far-off round of sky. It was extraordinary, this quality in
the taste of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wrong which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) completed sense of it seem rather
to soften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
had to recognise it; for what it came to was that seeing herself finally
sure, knowing everything, having the fact, in all its abomination, so
utterly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) that there was nothing else to add--what it came to
was that, merely by being WITH him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) there in silence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) felt, within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), the sudden split between conviction and action. They had begun to
cease, on the spot, surprisingly, to be connected; conviction, that is,
budged no inch, only planting its feet the more firmly in the soil--but
action began to hover like some lighter and larger, but easier form,
excited by its very power to keep above ground. It would be free, it
would be independent, it would go in--wouldn't it?--for some prodigious
and superior adventure of its own. What would condemn it, so to speak,
to the responsibility of freedom--this glimmered on Maggie even now--was
the possibility, richer with every lapsing moment, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband
would have, on the whole question, a new need of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), a need which was
in fact being born between them in these very seconds. It struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
truly as so new that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have felt hitherto none to compare with
it at all; would indeed, absolutely, by this circumstance, be REALLY
needing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for the first one in their whole connection. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had used
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), had even exceedingly enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), before this; but there had been
no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was rapidly taking on. The immense advantage of this particular clue,
moreover, was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should have now to arrange, alter, to falsify
nothing; should have to be but consistently simple and straight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
asked herself, with concentration, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) back was still presented,
what would be the very ideal of that method; after which, the next
instant, it had all come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had turned round upon him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) for
the application. <div class="bookquote">``Fanny Assingham broke it--knowing it had a crack and
that it would go if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) used sufficient force. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought, when I had
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), that that would be the best thing to do with it--thought so
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own point of view. That hadn't been at all my idea, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
acted before I understood. I had, on the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``put
it here, in full view, exactly that you might see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) pockets; he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had carried his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) eyes to the
fragments on the chimney-piece, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could already distinguish the
element of relief, absolutely of succour, in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) acceptance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) of
the opportunity to consider the fruits of their friend's violence--every
added inch of reflection and delay having the advantage, from this point
on, of counting for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) double. It had operated within her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now to the
last intensity, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) glimpse of the precious truth that by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) helping
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), helping him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to help himself, as it were, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should help him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to
help HER. Hadn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fairly got into his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) labyrinth with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)?--wasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
indeed in the very act of placing herself there, for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), at its centre
and core, whence, on that definite orientation and by an instinct all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might securely guide him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) out of it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) offered him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thus,
assuredly, a kind of support that was not to have been imagined in
advance, and that moreover required--ah most truly!--some close looking
at before it could be believed in and pronounced void of treachery.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, look, look,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seemed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) say even while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
sounded words were other--<div class="bookquote">``look, look, both at the truth that still
survives in that smashed evidence and at the even more remarkable
appearance that I'm not such a fool as you supposed me. Look at the
possibility that, since I AM different, there may still be something
in it for you--if you're capable of working with me to get that out.
Consider of course, as you must, the question of what you may have to
surrender, on your side, what price you may have to pay, whom you may
have to pay WITH, to set this advantage free; but take in, at any rate,
that there is something for you if you don't too blindly spoil your
chance for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) went no nearer the damnatory pieces, but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) eyed
them, from where he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) stood, with a degree of recognition just visibly
less to be dissimulated; all of which represented for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a certain
traceable process. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) uttered words, meanwhile, were different
enough from those he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) might have inserted between the lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
already-spoken. <div class="bookquote">``It's the golden bowl, you know, that you saw at the
little antiquario's in Bloomsbury, so long ago--when you went there with
Charlotte, when you spent those hours with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), unknown to me, a day or
two before our marriage. It was shown you both, but you didn't take
it; you left it for me, and I came upon it, extraordinarily, through
happening to go into the same shop on Monday last; in walking home, in
prowling about to pick up some small old thing for father's birthday,
after my visit to the Museum, my appointment there with Mr. Crichton,
of which I told you. It was shown me, and I was struck with it and took
it--knowing nothing about it at the time. What I now know I've learned
since--I learned this afternoon, a couple of hours ago; receiving from
it naturally a great impression. So there it is--in its three pieces.
You can handle them--don't be afraid--if you want to make sure the thing
is the thing you and Charlotte saw together. Its having come apart makes
an unfortunate difference for its beauty, its artistic value, but none
for anything else. Its other value is just the same--I mean that of its
having given me so much of the truth about you. I don't therefore so
much care what becomes of it now--unless perhaps you may yourself, when
you come to think, have some good use for it. In that case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie
wound up, <div class="bookquote">``we can easily take the pieces with us to Fawns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>It was wonderful how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt, by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had seen herself through
this narrow pass, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had really achieved something--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
emerging a little, in fine, with the prospect less contracted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
done for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), that is, what her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) instinct enjoined; had laid a basis not
merely momentary on which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). When, by the turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
head, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) did finally meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), this was the last thing that glimmered
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) look; but it came into sight, none the less, as a perception
of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) distress and almost as a question of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) eyes; so that, for still
another minute, before he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) committed himself, there occurred between them
a kind of unprecedented moral exchange over which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) superior lucidity
presided. It was not, however, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) did commit himself the show
was promptly portentous. <div class="bookquote">``But what in the world has Fanny Assingham had
to do with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could verily, out of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) smothered soreness, almost have smiled:
his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) question so affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as giving the whole thing up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). But
it left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) only to go the straighter. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) has had to do with it that
I immediately sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) immediately came. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was the
first person I wanted to see--because I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) would know. Know more
about what I had learned, I mean, than I could make out for myself. I
made out as much as I could for myself--that I also wanted to have done;
but it didn't, in spite of everything, take me very far, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) has
really been a help. Not so much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) would like to be--not so much as,
poor dear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) just now tried to be; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) has done her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) very best for
you--never forget that!--and has kept me along immeasurably better than
I should have been able to come without her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) has gained me time; and
that, these three months, don't you see? has been everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had said <div class="bookquote">``Don't you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>on purpose, and was to feel the next
moment that it had acted. <div class="bookquote">``These three months'?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Counting from the night you came home so late from Matcham. Counting

remarked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) attention, and with this impression for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), again, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was, in essence, fairly reaching out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for
time--time, only time--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could sufficiently imagine, and to whatever
strangeness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) absolutely liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to talk, even at the cost of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) losing almost everything else by it. It was still, for a minute, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) waited for something worse; wanted everything that was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to
come out, any definite fact, anything more precisely nameable, so that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) too--as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) right--should know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was. What stirred in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
above all, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) followed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face the clear train of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) speech,
must have been the impulse to take up something she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put before him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was yet afraid directly to touch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wanted to make free with it, but
had to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hands off--for reasons he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had already made out; and
the discomfort of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) privation yearned at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes with an
announcing gleam of the fever, the none too tolerable chill, of specific
recognition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) as speaking more or less for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father as
well, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes might have been trying to hypnotise her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) into giving
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the answer without his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asking the question. <div class="bookquote">``Had HE (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) idea, and
has he (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) now, with you, anything more?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--those were the words he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had to
hold himself from not speaking and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would as yet, certainly,
do nothing to make easy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sharpest thrill how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
straitened and tied, and with the miserable pity of it her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) present
conscious purpose of keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so could none the less perfectly
accord. To name her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, on any such basis of anxiety, of
compunction, would be to do the impossible thing, to do neither more nor
less than give Charlotte away. Visibly, palpably, traceably, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stood
off from this, moved back from it as from an open chasm now suddenly
perceived, but which had been, between the two, with so much, so
strangely much else, quite uncalculated. Verily it towered before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), this history of their confidence. They had built strong and piled
high--based as it was on such appearances--their conviction that, thanks
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) native complacencies of so many sorts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would always, quite to
the end and through and through, take them as nobly sparing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). Amerigo
was at any rate having the sensation of a particular ugliness to avoid,
a particular difficulty to count with, that practically found him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) as
unprepared as if he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had been, like his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wife, an abjectly simple person.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) meanwhile, however abjectly simple, was further discerning, for
herself, that, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) might have to take from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) being, on
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side, beautifully free--he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) would absolutely not be able, for any
qualifying purpose, to name Charlotte either. As his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) father-in-law's
wife Mrs. Verver rose between them there, for the time, in august and
prohibitive form; to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), explain about her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), was,
at the least, to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) into the question--which would be by the
same stroke to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) husband. But this was exactly the door Maggie
wouldn't open to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); on all of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was the next moment asking
herself if, thus warned and embarrassed, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were not fairly writhing in
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) writhed, on that hypothesis, some seconds more, for it was
not till then that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had chosen between what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could do and what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
couldn't.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're apparently drawing immense conclusions from very small
matters. Won't you perhaps feel, in fairness, that you're striking out,
triumphing, or whatever I may call it, rather too easily--feel it when
I perfectly admit that your smashed cup there does come back to me? I
frankly confess, now, to the occasion, and to having wished not to
speak of it to you at the time. We took two or three hours together, by
arrangement; it WAS on the eve of my marriage--at the moment you say.
But that put it on the eve of yours too, my dear--which was directly the
point. It was desired to find for you, at the eleventh hour, some
small wedding-present--a hunt, for something worth giving you, and yet
possible from other points of view as well, in which it seemed I could
be of use. You were naturally not to be told--precisely because it was
all FOR you. We went forth together and we looked; we rummaged about
and, as I remember we called it, we prowled; then it was that, as I
freely recognise, we came across that crystal cup--which I'm bound to
say, upon my honour, I think it rather a pity Fanny Assingham, from
whatever good motive, should have treated so.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands in
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pockets; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes again, but more complacently now, to the
ruins of the precious vessel; and Maggie could feel him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) exhale into the
achieved quietness of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) explanation a long, deep breath of comparative
relief. Behind everything, beneath everything, it was somehow a comfort
to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at last to be talking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seemed to be proving to
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) COULD talk. <div class="bookquote">``It was at a little shop in Bloomsbury--I
think I could go to the place now. The man understood Italian, I
remember; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted awfully to work off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bowl. But I didn't believe
in it, and we didn't take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie had listened with an interest that wore all the expression of
candour. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you left it for me. But what did you take?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); first as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were trying to remember, then as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
might have been trying to forget. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing, I think--at that place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you take then at any other? What did you get me--since that
was your aim and end--for a wedding-gift?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince continued very nobly to bethink himself. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't we get you
anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie waited a little; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had for some time, now, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
steadily; but they wandered, at this, to the fragments on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) chimney.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes; it comes round, after all, to your having got me the bowl. I
myself was to come upon it, the other day, by so wonderful a chance; was
to find it in the same place and to have it pressed upon me by the same
little man, who does, as you say, understand Italian. I did `believe in
it,' you see--must have believed in it somehow instinctively; for I took
it as soon as I saw it. Though I didn't know at all then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``what I was taking WITH it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for an instant, visibly, the deference of trying
to imagine what this might have been. <div class="bookquote">``I agree with you that the

into the order of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thoughts, to which, through whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might say,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was still adhering. <div class="bookquote">``It's not my having gone into the place, at the

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>```Such a friend'?'' As a wonder, assuredly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband could but take
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As the little man in the shop. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did for me more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew--I owe

afterwards said to herself--to abide, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) light, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) clue, by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own order.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I inspired him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with sympathy--there you are! But the miracle is that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have a sympathy to offer that could be of use to me. That was
really the oddity of my chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess proceeded--<div class="bookquote">``that I should

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) so keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) course that it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could, at the best,
but stand aside to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) pass; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) only made a vague
demonstration that was like an ineffective gesture. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to say
any ill of your friends, and the thing was a long time ago; besides

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) gave a slow headshake--as if, no, after consideration, not THAT way
were an issue. <div class="bookquote">``I can only think of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as kind, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had nothing to

he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had asked me too high a price, more than the object was really worth.
There was a particular reason, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't mentioned, and which had
made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) consider and repent. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote for leave to see me again--wrote

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here?'' (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>--it made the Prince look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Downstairs--in the little red room. While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was waiting he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at
the few photographs that stand about there and recognised two of them.
Though it was so long ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered the visit made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the lady
and the gentleman, and that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) connexion. It gave me mine,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered everything and told me everything. You see you too had
produced your effect; only, unlike you, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thought of it again--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
HAD recurred to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me of your having wished to make each other
presents--but of that's not having come off. The lady was greatly taken
with the piece I had bought of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but you had your reason against
receiving it from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and you had been right. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would think that of
you more than ever now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie went on; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would see how wisely you
had guessed the flaw and how easily the bowl could be broken. I had
bought it myself, you see, for a present--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew I was doing that. This
was what had worked in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--especially after the price I had paid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) story had dropped an instant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) still brought it out in small
waves of energy, each of which spent its force; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had an
opportunity to speak before this force was renewed. But the quaint thing
was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) now said. <div class="bookquote">``And what, pray, WAS the price?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) paused again a little. <div class="bookquote">``It was high, certainly--for those fragments.
I think I feel, as I look at them there, rather ashamed to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince then again looked at them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might have been growing used to
the sight. <div class="bookquote">``But shall you at least get your money back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm far from wanting it back--I feel so that I'm getting its
worth.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With which, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could reply, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had a quick transition.
<div class="bookquote">``The great fact about the day we're talking of seems to me to have been,
quite remarkably, that no present was then made me. If your undertaking
had been for that, that was not at least what came of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You received then nothing at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div>The Prince looked vague and grave,
almost retrospectively concerned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but an apology for empty hands and empty pockets; which was

 (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div><p/>This Amerigo heard with interest, yet not with confusion. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, of course
you couldn't have minded!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Distinctly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was getting
the better of the mere awkwardness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) arrest; quite as if making out
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) need SUFFER arrest from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now--before they should go forth
to show themselves in the world together--in no greater quantity than
an occasion ill-chosen at the best for a scene might decently make room
for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) watch; their engagement, all the while, remained
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But I don't make out, you see, what case against me you
rest--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On everything I'm telling you? Why, the whole case--the case of your

but at this, as to check any show of impatience, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again stood still.
<div class="bookquote">``You've never been more sacred to me than you were at that hour--unless

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) speech, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could note, quite held up its head in

something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), from
afar off, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) strange consistency. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) direction still,
however, under that. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, the thing I've known best of all is that
you've never wanted, together, to offend us. You've wanted quite

think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``is the way I've best known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Known?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) repeated after a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Known. Known that you were older friends, and so much more intimate

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would they have made a difference, in the matter of our marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) again fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hard yearning, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) couldn't
keep down: <div class="bookquote">``The question is so much bigger than that. You see how
much what I know makes of it for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was what acted on him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), this
iteration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knowledge, into the question of the validity, of the
various bearings of which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) couldn't on the spot trust himself
to pretend, in any high way, to go. What her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) claim, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made it,
represented for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) couldn't help betraying, if only as a

<div class="bookquote">``know, know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) nerves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was capable of being sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
nerves at a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) should need them for dining out, pompously,

as nothing else did to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) race. <div class="bookquote">``It's you, cara, who are deep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Which, after an instant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had accepted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could so feel at

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what would you have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was by this time asking, <div class="bookquote">``if I HADN'T
come in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``What would you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh; I oh--that isn't the question. I depend upon you. I go on. You would
have spoken to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I would have waited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To see what difference it would make for myself. My possession at last,
I mean, of real knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>said the Prince.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My only point now, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``is the difference, as I
say, that it may make for YOU. Your knowing was--from the moment you did
come in--all I had in view.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sounded it again--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) should have it
once more. <div class="bookquote">``Your knowing that I've ceased--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you've ceased--?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pause, in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had fairly made him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
press her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to be as I was. NOT to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was once more then, after a little, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had had to stand
receptive; yet the singular effect of this was that there was still
something of the same sort he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was made to want. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had another
hesitation, but at last this odd quantity showed. <div class="bookquote">``Then does any one
else know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as near as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could come to naming her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
at that distance. <div class="bookquote">``Any one--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any one, I mean, but Fanny Assingham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have supposed you had had by this time particular means of
learning. I don't see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``why you ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, after an instant--and only after an instant, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) made
out what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) meant; and it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), all strangely enough, the still
further light that Charlotte, for herself, knew as little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
known. The vision loomed, in this light, it fairly glared, for the
few seconds--the vision of the two others alone together at Fawns, and
Charlotte, as one of them, having gropingly to go on, always not knowing
and not knowing! The picture flushed at the same time with all its
essential colour--that of the so possible identity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father's
motive and principle with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own. HE (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``deep,''  (<font color='red'><b>HE</b></font>)</div>as Amerigo called it,
so that no vibration of the still air should reach his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter; just
as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had earned that description by making and by, for that matter,
intending still to make, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) care for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) serenity, or at any rate
for the firm outer shell of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dignity, all marvellous enamel, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
paramount law. More strangely even than anything else, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband
seemed to speak now but to help her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in this. <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing but what
you tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I've told you all I intended. Find out the rest--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Find it out--?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) waited.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a moment--it took that time to go on. Depth upon
depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) situation, as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face, surged and sank within her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>);
but with the effect somehow, once more, that they rather lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) than
let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) drop. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) feet somewhere, through it all--it was her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
companion, absolutely, who was at sea. And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) feet; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
pressed them to what was beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) went over to the bell beside
the chimney and gave a ring that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could but take as a summons for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
maid. It stopped everything for the present; it was an intimation to him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
to go and dress. But she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had to insist. <div class="bookquote">``Find out for yourself!''




 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/>PART FIFTH

<p/>XXXV

<p/>After the little party was again constituted at Fawns--which had taken,
for completeness, some ten days--Maggie naturally felt herself still
more possessed, in spirit, of everything that had last happened in
London. There was a phrase that came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from old American
years: she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was having, by that idiom, the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) life--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew it
by the perpetual throb of this sense of possession, which was almost
too violent either to recognise or to hide. It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had come
out--that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) most general consciousness; out of a dark tunnel, a
dense wood, or even simply a smoky room, and had thereby, at least,
for going on, the advantage of air in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lungs. It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were
somehow at last gathering in the fruits of patience; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had either been
really more patient than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had known at the time, or had been so for
longer: the change brought about by itself as great a difference of
view as the shift of an inch in the position of a telescope. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
telescope in fact that had gained in range--just as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) danger lay
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) exposing herself to the observation by the more charmed, and
therefore the more reckless, use of this optical resource. Not under
any provocation to produce it in public was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) unremitted rule; but
the difficulties of duplicity had not shrunk, while the need of it had
doubled. Humbugging, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had so practised with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father, had
been a comparatively simple matter on the basis of mere doubt; but the
ground to be covered was now greatly larger, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt not unlike
some young woman of the theatre who, engaged for a minor part in the
play and having mastered her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cues with anxious effort, should find
herself suddenly promoted to leading lady and expected to appear in
every act of the five. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had made much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband, that last
night, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``knowing'' (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>; but it was exactly this quantity she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now
knew that, from the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could only dissimulate it, added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
responsibility and made of the latter all a mere question of having
something precious and precarious in charge. There was no one to help
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with it--not even Fanny Assingham now; this good friend's presence
having become, inevitably, with that climax of their last interview in
Portland Place, a severely simplified function. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) use, oh
yes, a thousand times; but it could only consist henceforth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) quite
conspicuously touching at no point whatever--assuredly, at least with
Maggie--the matter they had discussed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was there, inordinately, as a
value, but as a value only for the clear negation of everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
their general sign, precisely, of unimpaired beatitude--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was to
live up to that somewhat arduous character, poor thing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might privately lapse from it, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must, with Amerigo or with
Charlotte--only not, of course, ever, so much as for the wink of an eye,
with the master of the house. Such lapses would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own affair, which
Maggie at present could take no thought of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) young friend
meanwhile, it was to be said, to no betrayal of such wavering; so that
from the moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) alighting at the door with the Colonel everything
went on between them at concert pitch. What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) done, that last
evening in Maggie's room, but bring the husband and wife more together
than, as would seem, they had ever been? Therefore what indiscretion
should she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) not show by attempting to go behind the grand appearance of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) success?--which would be to court a doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beneficent work.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew accordingly nothing but harmony and diffused, restlessly,
nothing but peace--an extravagant, expressive, aggressive peace, not
incongruous, after all, with the solid calm of the place; a kind of
helmetted, trident-shaking pax Britannica.

<p/>The peace, it must be added, had become, as the days elapsed, a peace
quite generally animated and peopled--thanks to that fact of the
presence of <div class="bookquote">``company''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>in which Maggie's ability to preserve an
appearance had learned, from so far back, to find its best resource. It
was not inconspicuous, it was in fact striking, that this resource, just
now, seemed to meet in the highest degree every one's need: quite as if
every one were, by the multiplication of human objects in the scene, by
the creation, by the confusion, of fictive issues, hopeful of escaping
somebody else's notice. It had reached the point, in truth, that the
collective bosom might have been taken to heave with the knowledge of
the descent upon adjacent shores, for a short period, of Mrs. Rance and
the Lutches, still united, and still so divided, for conquest: the sense
of the party showed at least, oddly enough, as favourable to the fancy
of the quaint turn that some near <div class="bookquote">``week-end''  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>might derive from their
reappearance. This measured for Maggie the ground they had all travelled
together since that unforgotten afternoon of the none so distant year,
that determinant September Sunday when, sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father in the
park, as in commemoration of the climax both of their old order and of
their old danger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that they should <div class="bookquote">``call
in''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Charlotte,--call her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in as a specialist might be summoned to an
invalid's chair. Wasn't it a sign of something rather portentous, their
being ready to be beholden, as for a diversion, to the once despised
Kitty and Dotty? That had already had its application, in truth, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>)
invocation of the Castledeans and several other members, again, of
the historic Matcham week, made before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>) left town, and made, always
consistently, with an idea--since she (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>) was never henceforth to approach
these people without an idea, and since that lurid element of their
intercourse grew and grew for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>) with each occasion. The flame with
which it burned afresh during these particular days, the way it held up
the torch to anything, to everything, that MIGHT have occurred as the
climax of revels springing from traditions so vivified--this by itself
justified her (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>) private motive and reconsecrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>) diplomacy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>) had
already produced by the aid of these people something of the effect she (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>)
sought--that of being <div class="bookquote">``good''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>) companions were good for,
and of not asking either of them to give up anyone or anything for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>)
sake. There was moreover, frankly, a sharpness of point in it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>)
enjoyed; it gave an accent to the truth she (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>) wished to illustrate--the
truth that the surface of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>) recent life, thick-sown with the flower of
earnest endeavour, with every form of the unruffled and the undoubting,
suffered no symptom anywhere to peep out. It was as if, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>)
pressure, neither party could get rid of the complicity, as it might be
figured, of the other; as if, in a word, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dotty</b></font>) saw Amerigo and Charlotte
committed, for fear of betrayals on their own side, to a kind of wan
consistency on the subject of Lady Castledean's <div class="bookquote">``set,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Castledean/Castledean</b></font>)</div>and this latter
group, by the same stroke, compelled to assist at attestations the
extent and bearing of which they rather failed to grasp and which left
them indeed, in spite of hereditary high spirits, a trifle bewildered
and even a trifle scared.

<p/>They made, none the less, at Fawns, for number, for movement, for
sound--they played their parts during a crisis that must have hovered
for them, in the long passages of the old house, after the fashion
of the established ghost, felt, through the dark hours as a constant
possibility, rather than have menaced them in the form of a daylight
bore, one of the perceived outsiders who are liable to be met in the
drawing-room or to be sat next to at dinner. If the Princess, moreover,
had failed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) occult use for so much of the machinery of diversion,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would still have had a sense not other than sympathetic for the
advantage now extracted from it by Fanny Assingham's bruised philosophy.
This good friend's relation to it was actually the revanche, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
sufficiently indicated, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) obscured lustre at Matcham, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had
known her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) way about so much less than most of the others. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) knew it
at Fawns, through the pathless wild of the right tone, positively
better than any one, Maggie could note for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) revenge had the
magnanimity of a brave pointing out of it to every one else, a wonderful
irresistible, conscious, almost compassionate patronage. Here was a
house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) triumphantly caused it to be noted, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) so bristled
with values that some of them might serve, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) amused willingness to
share, for such of the temporarily vague, among her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fellow-guests, such
of the dimly disconcerted, as had lost the key to their own. It may have
been partly through the effect of this especial strain of community with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) old friend that Maggie found herself, one evening, moved to take
up again their dropped directness of reference. They had remained
downstairs together late; the other women of the party had filed, singly
or in couples, up the <div class="bookquote">``grand''  (<font color='red'><b>couples</b></font>)</div>staircase on which, from the equally grand
hall, these retreats and advances could always be pleasantly observed;
the men had apparently taken their way to the smoking-room; while the
Princess, in possession thus of a rare reach of view, had lingered as
if to enjoy it. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) saw that Mrs. Assingham was remaining a
little--and as for the appreciation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) enjoyment; upon which they
stood looking at each other across the cleared prospect until the elder
woman, only vaguely expressive and tentative now, came nearer. It was
like the act of asking if there were anything she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could yet do, and that
question was answered by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) immediately feeling, on this closer view,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had felt when presenting herself in Portland Place after Maggie's
last sharp summons. Their understanding was taken up by these new
snatched moments where that occasion had left it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has never told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that I know. Of that I'm at last satisfied.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>And
then as Mrs. Assingham opened wide eyes: <div class="bookquote">``I've been in the dark since
we came down, not understanding what he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has been doing or intending--not
making out what can have passed between them. But within a day or two
I've begun to suspect, and this evening, for reasons--oh, too many to
tell you!--I've been sure, since it explains. NOTHING has passed between
them--that's what has happened. It explains,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>the Princess repeated
with energy; <div class="bookquote">``it explains, it explains!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) spoke in a manner that her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
auditor was afterwards to describe to the Colonel, oddly enough, as that
of the quietest excitement; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had turned back to the chimney-place,
where, in honour of a damp day and a chill night, the piled logs had
turned to flame and sunk to embers; and the evident intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
vision for the fact she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) imparted made Fanny Assingham wait upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
words. It explained, this striking fact, more indeed than her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion,
though conscious of fairly gaping with good-will, could swallow at once.
The Princess, however, as for indulgence and confidence, quickly filled
up the measure. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hasn't let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) know that I know--and, clearly,
doesn't mean to. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has made up his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'ll say nothing about it.
Therefore, as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s quite unable to arrive at the knowledge by herself,
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has no idea how much I'm really in possession. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) believes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said
Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``and, so far as her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own conviction goes, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knows, that I'm not
in possession of anything. And that, somehow, for my own help seems to
me immense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Immense, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham applausively murmured, though not
quite, even as yet, seeing all the way. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s keeping quiet then on
purpose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On purpose.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie's lighted eyes, at least, looked further than they
had ever looked. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'ll NEVER tell her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny wondered; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cast about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); most of all she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) little
friend, in whom this announcement was evidently animated by an heroic
lucidity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stood there, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) full uniform, like some small erect
commander of a siege, an anxious captain who has suddenly got news,
replete with importance for him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), of agitation, of division within the
place. This importance breathed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) comrade. <div class="bookquote">``So you're all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ALL right's a good deal to say. But I seem at least to see, as I
haven't before, where I am with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny bountifully brooded; there was a point left vague. <div class="bookquote">``And you have
it from him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?--your husband himself has told you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>```Told' me--?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what you speak of. It isn't of an assurance received from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) then
that you do speak?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>At which Maggie had continued to stare. <div class="bookquote">``Dear me, no. Do you suppose
I've asked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for an assurance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you haven't?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion smiled. <div class="bookquote">``That's what I supposed you
MIGHT mean. Then, darling, what HAVE you--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Asked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for? I've asked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>But this, in turn, made Fanny stare. <div class="bookquote">``Then nothing, that evening of the
Embassy dinner, passed between you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, everything passed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) what I knew--and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) how I knew it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham waited. <div class="bookquote">``And that was all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't it quite enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, love,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) bridled, <div class="bookquote">``that's for you to have judged!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I HAVE judged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie--<div class="bookquote">``I did judge. I made sure he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
understood--then I let him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham wondered. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) didn't explain--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Explain? Thank God, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head as with horror at
the thought, then the next moment added: <div class="bookquote">``And I didn't, either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>The decency of pride in it shed a cold little light--yet as from heights
at the base of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion rather panted. <div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) neither
denies nor confesses--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does what's a thousand times better--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lets it alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie went on, <div class="bookquote">``as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would do; as I see now that I was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lets me alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny Assingham turned it over. <div class="bookquote">``Then how do you know so where, as you
say, you `are'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, just BY that. I put him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in possession of the difference; the
difference made, about me, by the fact that I hadn't been, after
all--though with a wonderful chance, I admitted, helping me--too
stupid to have arrived at knowledge. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had to see that I'm changed for
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--quite changed from the idea of me that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had so long been going on
with. It became a question then of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) really taking in the change--and
what I now see is that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is doing so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny followed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">``Which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shows by letting you, as you say,
alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a minute. <div class="bookquote">``And by letting her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham did what she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) might to embrace it--checked a little,
however, by a thought that was the nearest approach she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) could have, in
this almost too large air, to an inspiration. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, but does Charlotte
let HIM?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's another affair--with which I've practically nothing to do.
I dare say, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) doesn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>And the Princess had a more distant
gaze for the image evoked by the question. <div class="bookquote">``I don't in fact well see how
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) CAN. But the point for me is that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) understands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny Assingham cooed, <div class="bookquote">``understands--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what I want. I want a happiness without a hole in it big enough
for you to poke in your finger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A brilliant, perfect surface--to begin with at least. I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The golden bowl--as it WAS to have been.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>And Maggie dwelt musingly on
this obscured figure. <div class="bookquote">``The bowl with all our happiness in it. The bowl
without the crack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>For Mrs. Assingham too the image had its force, and the precious object
shone before her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) again, reconstituted, plausible, presentable. But
wasn't there still a piece missing? <div class="bookquote">``Yet if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lets you alone and you
only let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mayn't our doing so, you mean, be noticed?--mayn't it give us away?
Well, we hope not--we try not--we take such care. We alone know what's
between us--we and you; and haven't you precisely been struck, since
you've been here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie asked, <div class="bookquote">``with our making so good a show?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``To your father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>But it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hesitate too; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wouldn't speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father directly.
<div class="bookquote">``To everyone. To her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>)--now that you understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>It held poor Fanny again in wonder. <div class="bookquote">``To Charlotte--yes: if there's so
much beneath it, for you, and if it's all such a plan. That makes
it hang together it makes YOU hang together.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fairly exhaled her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
admiration. <div class="bookquote">``You're like nobody else--you're extraordinary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie met it with appreciation, but with a reserve. <div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not
extraordinary--but I AM, for every one, quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's just what is extraordinary. `Quiet' is more than _I_ am,
and you leave me far behind.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>With which, again, for an instant, Mrs.
Assingham frankly brooded. ```Now that I understand,' you say--but
there's one thing I don't understand.'' And the next minute, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
companion waited, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had mentioned it. <div class="bookquote">``How can Charlotte, after all,
not have pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>), not have attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) about it? How can she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) not
have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>)--asked him (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) honour, I mean--if you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) `not'? Why, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess limpidly, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
MUST!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, you think, he (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) must have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)? Why, exactly what I mean,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``is that he (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) will have done nothing of the sort; will, as I
say, have maintained the contrary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny Assingham weighed it. <div class="bookquote">``Under her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) direct appeal for the truth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Under her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) direct appeal for the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) honour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) honour. That's my point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny Assingham braved it. <div class="bookquote">``For the truth as from him (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From him (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) to any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham's face lighted. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>)'ll simply, he (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>)'ll insistently have
lied?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie brought it out roundly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>)'ll simply, he (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>)'ll insistently have
lied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>It held again her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion, who next, however, with a single movement,
throwing herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) neck, overflowed. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you knew how you help
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie had liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to understand, so far as this was possible; but had
not been slow to see afterwards how the possibility was limited, when
one came to think, by mysteries she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not to sound. This inability in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was indeed not remarkable, inasmuch as the Princess herself, as
we have seen, was only now in a position to boast of touching bottom.
Maggie lived, inwardly, in a consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could but partly
open even to so good a friend, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own visitation of the fuller
expanse of which was, for that matter, still going on. They had been
duskier still, however, these recesses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagination--that, no
doubt, was what might at present be said for them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had looked into
them, on the eve of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) leaving town, almost without penetration: she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had made out in those hours, and also, of a truth, during the days which
immediately followed, little more than the strangeness of a relation
having for its chief mark--whether to be prolonged or not--the absence
of any <div class="bookquote">``intimate''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>result of the crisis she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband to
recognise. They had dealt with this crisis again, face to face, very
briefly, the morning after the scene in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) room--but with the odd
consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) having appeared merely to leave it on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had received it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might have received a bunch of keys or a
list of commissions--attentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) instructions about them, but only
putting them, for the time, very carefully and safely, into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
pocket. The instructions had seemed, from day to day, to make so little
difference for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) behaviour--that is for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) speech or his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) silence;
to produce, as yet, so little of the fruit of action. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had taken from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), on the spot, in a word, before going to dress for dinner, all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
then had to give--after which, on the morrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for more,
a good deal as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have renewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) supply during the night;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had had at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) command for this latter purpose an air of
extraordinary detachment and discretion, an air amounting really to an
appeal which, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could have brought herself to describe it vulgarly,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have described as cool, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) himself would have
described it in any one else as <div class="bookquote">``cheeky'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; a suggestion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should
trust him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on the particular ground since she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't on the general.
Neither his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) speech nor his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) silence struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as signifying more, or
less, under this pressure, than they had seemed to signify for weeks
past; yet if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sense hadn't been absolutely closed to the possibility
in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) of any thought of wounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
undisturbed manner, the perfection of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) appearance of having recovered
himself, for one of those intentions of high impertinence by the aid of
which great people, les grands seigneurs, persons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband's class
and type, always know how to re-establish a violated order.

<p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) one purely good fortune that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could feel thus sure
impertinence--to HER at any rate--was not among the arts on which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
proposed to throw himself; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had, in so almost mystifying
a manner, replied to nothing, denied nothing, explained nothing,
apologised for nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had somehow conveyed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that this was not
because of any determination to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) case as not <div class="bookquote">``worth''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>it. There
had been consideration, on both occasions, in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had listened
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--even though at the same time there had been extreme reserve;
a reserve indeed, it was also to be remembered, qualified by the fact
that, on their second and shorter interview, in Portland Place, and
quite at the end of this passage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) positively
proposing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a temporary accommodation. It had been but the matter
of something in the depths of the eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) finally fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had found in it, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept it before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), the
tacitly-offered sketch of a working arrangement. <div class="bookquote">``Leave me my reserve;
don't question it--it's all I have, just now, don't you see? so that, if
you'll make me the concession of letting me alone with it for as long a
time as I require, I promise you something or other, grown under cover
of it, even though I don't yet quite make out what, as a return for your
patience.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with some such unspoken words as
that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ear, and indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had to represent to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
spiritually heard them, had to listen to them still again, to explain
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) particular patience in face of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) particular failure. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hadn't so
much as pretended to meet for an instant the question raised by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) accepted ignorance of the point in time, the period before their own
marriage, from which his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) intimacy with Charlotte dated. As an ignorance
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and Charlotte had been personally interested--and to the
pitch of consummately protecting, for years, each other's interest--as
a condition so imposed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) the fact of its having ceased might
have made it, on the spot, the first article of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) defence. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
vouchsafed it, however, nothing better than his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) longest stare of
postponed consideration. That tribute he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had coldly paid it, and Maggie
might herself have been stupefied, truly, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) not had something to
hold on by, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own present ability, even provisional, to make terms
with a chapter of history into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could but a week before not
have dipped without a mortal chill. At the rate at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was living
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was getting used hour by hour to these extensions of view; and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked herself, at Fawns, to what single observation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own, in
London, the Prince had had an affirmation to oppose, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) but just failed
to focus the small strained wife of the moments in question as
some panting dancer of a difficult step who had capered, before the
footlights of an empty theatre, to a spectator lounging in a box.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) best comprehension of Amerigo's success in not committing himself
was in her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) recall, meanwhile, of the inquiries he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) had made of her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) on
their only return to the subject, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) had in fact explicitly
provoked their return in order to make. He (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) had had it over with her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>)
again, the so distinctly remarkable incident of her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) interview at home
with the little Bloomsbury shopman. This anecdote, for him (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>), had, not
altogether surprisingly, required some straighter telling, and the
Prince's attitude in presence of it had represented once more his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
nearest approach to a cross-examination. The difficulty in respect to
the little man had been for the question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) motive--his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) motive in
writing, first, in the spirit of retraction, to a lady with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
made a most advantageous bargain, and in then coming to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) so that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) apology should be personal. Maggie had felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) explanation weak;
but there were the facts, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could give no other. Left alone, after
the transaction, with the knowledge that his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) visitor designed the object
bought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) as a birthday-gift to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father--for Maggie confessed
freely to having chattered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) almost as to a friend--the vendor of
the golden bowl had acted on a scruple rare enough in vendors of any
class, and almost unprecedented in the thrifty children of Israel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
hadn't liked what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had done, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had above all made such a
<div class="bookquote">``good thing''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of having done; at the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) purchaser's good
faith and charming presence, opposed to that flaw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) acquestion
which would make it, verily, as an offering to a loved parent, a thing
of sinister meaning and evil effect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had known conscientious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
had known superstitious visitings, had given way to a whim all the more
remarkable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own commercial mind, no doubt, from its never having
troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in other connexions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had recognised the oddity of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) adventure and left it to show for what it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not been
unconscious, on the other hand, that if it hadn't touched Amerigo so
nearly he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would have found in it matter for some amused reflection.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had uttered an extraordinary sound, something between a laugh and
a howl, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had made a point of doing: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, most
certainly, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) TOLD me his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) reason was because he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) `liked' me'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
remained in doubt of whether that inarticulate comment had been provoked
most by the familiarities she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had offered or by those that, so pictured,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had had to endure. That the partner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) bargain had yearned to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) again, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had plainly jumped at a pretext for it, this
also she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had frankly expressed herself to the Prince as having, in no
snubbing, no scandalised, but rather in a positively appreciative
and indebted spirit, not delayed to make out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had wished, ever
so seriously, to return her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) money, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had wholly
declined to receive it; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
not, at all events, already devoted the crystal cup to the beautiful
purpose she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had, so kindly and so fortunately, named to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). It wasn't
a thing for a present to a person she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was fond of, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wouldn't wish
to give a present that would bring ill luck. That had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) couldn't rest, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) should feel better now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) having led her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to act in ignorance was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) should have been
ashamed of; and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would pardon, gracious lady as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was, all the
liberties he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had taken, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might make of the bowl any use in life but
that one.

<p/>It was after this that the most extraordinary incident of all, of
course, had occurred--his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) pointing to the two photographs with the
remark that those were persons he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew, and that, more wonderful still,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had made acquaintance with them, years before, precisely over the
same article. The lady, on that occasion, had taken up the fancy of
presenting it to the gentleman, and the gentleman, guessing and dodging
ever so cleverly, had declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wouldn't for the world receive an
object under such suspicion. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) himself, the little man had confessed,
wouldn't have minded--about THEM; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never forgotten either
their talk or their faces, the impression altogether made by them, and,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) really wished to know, now, what had perhaps most moved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), it
was the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should ignorantly have gone in for a thing not
good enough for other buyers. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been immensely struck--that was
another point--with this accident of their turning out, after so long,
friends of hers too: they had disappeared, and this was the only light
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever had upon them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had flushed up, quite red, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
recognition, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) responsibility--had declared that the
connexion must have had, mysteriously, something to do with the impulse
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had obeyed. And Maggie had made, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband, while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again
stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), no secret of the shock, for herself, so suddenly and
violently received. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) best, even while taking it full
in the face, not to give herself away; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wouldn't answer--no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
wouldn't--for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) agitation, have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) informant
think. He (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) might think what he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) would--there had been three or four
minutes during which, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) question upon question, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had doubtless too little cared. And he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) had spoken, for his (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) remembrance,
as fully as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could have wished; he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) had spoken, oh, delightedly, for
the <div class="bookquote">``terms''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on which his (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) other visitors had appeared to be with each
other, and in fact for that conviction of the nature and degree of their
intimacy under which, in spite of precautions, they hadn't been able to
help leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) had observed and judged and not forgotten; he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) had
been sure they were great people, but no, ah no, distinctly, hadn't
<div class="bookquote">``liked''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>them as he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) liked the Signora Principessa. Certainly--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
created no vagueness about that--he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) had been in possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) name
and address, for sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) both her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) cup and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) account. But the
others he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) had only, always, wondered about--he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) had been sure they would
never come back. And as to the time of their visit, he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) could place it,
positively, to a day--by reason of a transaction of importance, recorded
in his (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) books, that had occurred but a few hours later. He (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
in short, definitely rejoicing that he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) had been able to make up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for not having been quite <div class="bookquote">``square''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>over their little business by
rendering her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), so unexpectedly, the service of this information. His (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>)
joy, moreover, was--as much as Amerigo would!--a matter of the personal
interest with which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kindness, gentleness, grace, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) charming
presence and easy humanity and familiarity, had inspired him (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>). All of
which, while, in thought, Maggie went over it again and again--oh, over
any imputable rashness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own immediate passion and pain, as well
as over the rest of the straight little story she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had, after all, to
tell--might very conceivably make a long sum for the Prince to puzzle
out.

<p/>There were meanwhile, after the Castledeans and those invited to meet
them had gone, and before Mrs. Rance and the Lutches had come, three or
four days during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) was to learn the full extent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) need not
to be penetrable; and then it was indeed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) felt all the force,
and threw herself upon all the help, of the truth she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) had confided,
several nights earlier, to Fanny Assingham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had known it in advance,
had warned herself of it while the house was full: Charlotte had designs
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) of a nature best known to herself, and was only waiting for the
better opportunity of their finding themselves less companioned.
This consciousness had been exactly at the bottom of Maggie's wish
to multiply their spectators; there were moments for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), positively,
moments of planned postponement, of evasion scarcely less disguised
than studied, during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned over with anxiety the different
ways--there being two or three possible ones--in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) young
stepmother might, at need, seek to work upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Amerigo's not having
<div class="bookquote">``told''  (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>) passage with his (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>) wife gave, for Maggie, altogether a
new aspect to Charlotte's consciousness and condition--an aspect
with which, for apprehension, for wonder, and even, at moments,
inconsequently enough, for something like compassion, the Princess had
now to reckon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) asked herself--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was capable of that--what he (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>)
had MEANT by keeping the sharer of his (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>) guilt in the dark about a matter
touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) otherwise so nearly; what he (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>) had meant, that is, for this
unmistakably mystified personage herself. Maggie could imagine what he (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>)
had meant for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--all sorts of thinkable things, whether things of mere
<div class="bookquote">``form''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or things of sincerity, things of pity or things of prudence: he (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>)
had meant, for instance, in all probability, primarily, to conjure away
any such appearance of a changed relation between the two women as his (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>)
father-in-law might notice and follow up. It would have been open to him (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>)
however, given the pitch of their intimacy, to avert this danger by some
more conceivable course with Charlotte; since an earnest warning, in
fact, the full freedom of alarm, that of his (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>) insisting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) on the
peril of suspicion incurred, and on the importance accordingly of
outward peace at any price, would have been the course really most
conceivable. Instead of warning and advising he (<font color='blue'><b>spectators</b></font>) had reassured and
deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); so that our young woman, who had been, from far back,
by the habit, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) nature, as much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) guard against sacrificing
others as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt the great trap of life mainly to be set for one's
doing so, now found herself attaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fancy to that side of the
situation of the exposed pair which involved, for themselves at least,
the sacrifice of the least fortunate.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) never, at present, thought of what Amerigo might be intending,
without the reflection, by the same stroke, that, whatever this
quantity, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was leaving still more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own ingenuity. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was helping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), when the thing came to the test, only by the polished, possibly
almost too polished surface his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) manner to his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) wife wore for an admiring
world; and that, surely, was entitled to scarcely more than the praise
of negative diplomacy. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) manner right, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
related to Mrs. Assingham; the case would have been beyond calculation,
truly, if, on top of everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had allowed it to go wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
hours of exaltation indeed when the meaning of all this pressed in upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as a tacit vow from him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) to abide without question by whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
should be able to achieve or think fit to prescribe. Then it was that,
even while holding her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) breath for the awe of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) truly felt almost
able enough for anything. It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had passed, in a time
incredibly short, from being nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) to being all; it was as if,
rightly noted, every turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) head, every tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) voice, in these
days, might mean that there was but one way in which a proud man reduced
to abjection could hold himself. During those of Maggie's vigils in
which that view loomed largest, the image of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband that it thus
presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gave out a beauty for the revelation of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
struck herself as paying, if anything, all too little. To make sure of
it--to make sure of the beauty shining out of the humility, and of the
humility lurking in all the pride of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presence--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have gone
the length of paying more yet, of paying with difficulties and
anxieties compared to which those actually before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have been as
superficial as headaches or rainy days.

<p/>The point at which these exaltations dropped, however, was the point
at which it was apt to come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) complications had been
greater the question of paying would have been limited still less to
the liabilities of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own pocket. The complications were verily great
enough, whether for ingenuities or sublimities, so long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had to
come back to it so often that Charlotte, all the while, could only
be struggling with secrets sharper than her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own. It was odd how that
certainty again and again determined and coloured her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wonderments
of detail; the question, for instance, of HOW Amerigo, in snatched
opportunities of conference, put the haunted creature off with false
explanations, met her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) particular challenges and evaded--if that was what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did do!--her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) particular demands. Even the conviction that Charlotte
was but awaiting some chance really to test her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) trouble upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lover's
wife left Maggie's sense meanwhile open as to the sight of gilt wires
and bruised wings, the spacious but suspended cage, the home of eternal
unrest, of pacings, beatings, shakings, all so vain, into which
the baffled consciousness helplessly resolved itself. The
cage was the deluded condition, and Maggie, as having known
delusion--rather!--understood the nature of cages. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) walked round
Charlotte's--cautiously and in a very wide circle; and when, inevitably,
they had to communicate she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt herself, comparatively, outside, on
the breast of nature, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion's face as that of a prisoner
looking through bars. So it was that through bars, bars richly gilt,
but firmly, though discreetly, planted, Charlotte finally struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as
making a grim attempt; from which, at first, the Princess drew back as
instinctively as if the door of the cage had suddenly been opened from
within.



<p/>XXXVI

<p/>They had been alone that evening--alone as a party of six, and four of
them, after dinner, under suggestion not to be resisted, sat down
to <div class="bookquote">``bridge''  (<font color='red'><b>a party</b></font>)</div>in the smoking-room. They had passed together to that
apartment, on rising from table, Charlotte and Mrs. Assingham alike
indulgent, always, to tobacco, and in fact practising an emulation
which, as Fanny said, would, for herself, had the Colonel not issued
an interdict based on the fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stealing his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) cigars, have stopped
only at the short pipe. Here cards had with inevitable promptness
asserted their rule, the game forming itself, as had often happened
before, of Mr. Verver with Mrs. Assingham for partner and of the Prince
with Mrs. Verver. The Colonel, who had then asked of Maggie license to
relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) mind of a couple of letters for the earliest post out on
the morrow, was addressing himself to this task at the other end of the
room, and the Princess herself had welcomed the comparatively hushed
hour--for the bridge-players were serious and silent--much in the mood
of a tired actress who has the good fortune to be <div class="bookquote">``off,''  (<font color='red'><b>a actress</b></font>)</div>while her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) mates
are on, almost long enough for a nap on the property sofa in the wing.
Maggie's nap, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) been able to snatch forty winks, would have been
of the spirit rather than of the sense; yet as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) subsided, near a
lamp, with the last salmon-coloured French periodical, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was to fail,
for refreshment, even of that sip of independence.

<p/>There was no question for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) found, of closing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes and
getting away; they strayed back to life, in the stillness, over the top
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) Review; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could lend herself to none of those refinements of
the higher criticism with which its pages bristled; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was there, where
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companions were, there again and more than ever there; it was as if,
of a sudden, they had been made, in their personal intensity and their
rare complexity of relation, freshly importunate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). It was the
first evening there had been no one else. Mrs. Rance and the Lutches
were due the next day; but meanwhile the facts of the situation were
upright for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) round the green cloth and the silver flambeaux; the fact
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) father's wife's lover facing his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mistress; the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>)
father sitting, all unsounded and unblinking, between them; the fact of
Charlotte keeping it up, keeping up everything, across the table, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); the fact of Fanny Assingham, wonderful creature,
placed opposite to the three and knowing more about each, probably, when
one came to think, than either of them knew of either. Erect above all
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was the sharp-edged fact of the relation of the whole group,
individually and collectively, to herself--herself so speciously
eliminated for the hour, but presumably more present to the attention of
each than the next card to be played.

<p/>Yes, under that imputation, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sense, they sat--the imputation of
wondering, beneath and behind all their apparently straight play, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
weren't really watching them from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) corner and consciously, as might
be said, holding them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was asking herself at last how
they could bear it--for, though cards were as nought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
could follow no move, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was always, on such occasions, out of
the party, they struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as conforming alike, in the matter of gravity
and propriety, to the stiff standard of the house. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
knew, was a high adept, one of the greatest--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been ever, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
stupidity, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) small, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sole despair; Amerigo excelled easily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
understood and practised every art that could beguile large leisure;
Mrs. Assingham and Charlotte, moreover, were accounted as <div class="bookquote">``good''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>as members of a sex incapable of the nobler consistency could be.
Therefore, evidently, they were not, all so up to their usual form,
merely passing it off, whether for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) or for themselves; and the amount
of enjoyed, or at least achieved, security represented by so complete a
conquest of appearances was what acted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) nerves, precisely, with
a kind of provocative force. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) found herself, for five minutes,
thrilling with the idea of the prodigious effect that, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) sat
there near them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) command; with the sense that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) were
but different--oh, ever so different!--all this high decorum would hang
by a hair. There reigned for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), absolutely, during these vertiginous
moments, that fascination of the monstrous, that temptation of the
horribly possible, which we so often trace by its breaking out suddenly,
lest it should go further, in unexplained retreats and reactions.

<p/>After it had been thus vividly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) for a little that, springing
up under her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wrong and making them all start, stare and turn pale, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
might sound out their doom in a single sentence, a sentence easy to
choose among several of the lurid--after she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had faced that blinding
light and felt it turn to blackness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) place, laying
aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) magazine, and moved slowly round the room, passing near the
card-players and pausing an instant behind the chairs in turn. Silent
and discreet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) bent a vague mild face upon them, as if to signify
that, little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) followed their doings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wished them well; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) took from each, across the table, in the common solemnity, an upward
recognition which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was to carry away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) moving out
to the terrace, a few minutes later. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) father and her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) husband, Mrs.
Assingham and Charlotte, had done nothing but meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) eyes; yet the
difference in these demonstrations made each a separate passage--which
was all the more wonderful since, with the secret behind every face,
they had alike tried to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) THROUGH it and in denial of it.

<p/>It all left her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) wandered off, with the strangest of
impressions--the sense, forced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) as never yet, of an appeal, a
positive confidence, from the four pairs of eyes, that was deeper than
any negation, and that seemed to speak, on the part of each, of some
relation to be contrived by her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), a relation with herself, which would
spare the individual the danger, the actual present strain, of the
relation with the others. They thus tacitly put it upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) to be
disposed of, the whole complexity of their peril, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) promptly saw
why because she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was there, and there just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was, to lift it off
them and take it; to charge herself with it as the scapegoat of old,
of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had once seen a terrible picture, had been charged with the
sins of the people and had gone forth into the desert to sink under his (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
burden and die. That indeed wasn't THEIR design and their interest, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) should sink under hers; it wouldn't be their feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) should
do anything but live, live on somehow for their benefit, and even as
much as possible in their company, to keep proving to them that they had
truly escaped and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was still there to simplify. This idea of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) simplifying, and of their combined struggle, dim as yet but steadily
growing, toward the perception of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) adopting it from them, clung to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) hovered on the terrace, where the summer night was so soft
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) scarce needed the light shawl she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had picked up. Several of the
long windows of the occupied rooms stood open to it, and the light came
out in vague shafts and fell upon the old smooth stones. The hour was
moonless and starless and the air heavy and still--which was why, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
evening dress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) need fear no chill and could get away, in the outer
darkness, from that provocation of opportunity which had assaulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>),
within, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) sofa, as a beast might have leaped at her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) throat.

<p/>Nothing in fact was stranger than the way in which, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had
remained there a little, her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companions, watched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) through one of
the windows, actually struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) as almost consciously and gratefully
safer. They might have been--really charming as they showed in the
beautiful room, and Charlotte certainly, as always, magnificently
handsome and supremely distinguished--they might have been figures
rehearsing some play of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) herself was the author; they might
even, for the happy appearance they continued to present, have been
such figures as would, by the strong note of character in each, fill
any author with the certitude of success, especially of their own
histrionic. They might in short have represented any mystery they would;
the point being predominantly that the key to the mystery, the key that
could wind and unwind it without a snap of the spring, was there in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pocket--or rather, no doubt, clasped at this crisis in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hand and
pressed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) walked back and forth, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) breast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) walked to
the end and far out of the light; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) returned and saw the others still
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had left them; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) passed round the house and looked into
the drawing-room, lighted also, but empty now, and seeming to speak
the more, in its own voice, of all the possibilities she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) controlled.
Spacious and splendid, like a stage again awaiting a drama, it was
a scene she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might people, by the press of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spring, either with
serenities and dignities and decencies, or with terrors and shames and
ruins, things as ugly as those formless fragments of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) golden bowl she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
was trying so hard to pick up.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) continued to walk and continued to pause; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stopped afresh for
the look into the smoking-room, and by this time--it was as if the
recognition had of itself arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) saw as in a picture, with
the temptation she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had fled from quite extinct, why it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been
able to give herself so little, from the first, to the vulgar heat of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might fairly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) watched them, have missed it as a
lost thing; have yearned for it, for the straight vindictive view, the
rights of resentment, the rages of jealousy, the protests of passion,
as for something she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been cheated of not least: a range of feelings
which for many women would have meant so much, but which for HER
husband's wife, for HER father's daughter, figured nothing nearer to
experience than a wild eastern caravan, looming into view with crude
colours in the sun, fierce pipes in the air, high spears against the
sky, all a thrill, a natural joy to mingle with, but turning off short
before it reached her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and plunging into other defiles. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) saw at
all events why horror itself had almost failed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); the horror that,
foreshadowed in advance, would, by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) thought, have made everything
that was unaccustomed in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cry out with pain; the horror of finding
evil seated, all at its ease, where she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had only dreamed of good; the
horror of the thing HIDEOUSLY behind, behind so much trusted, so much
pretended, nobleness, cleverness, tenderness. It was the first sharp
falsity she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had known in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) life, to touch at all, or be touched by;
it had met her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) like some bad-faced stranger surprised in one of the
thick-carpeted corridors of a house of quiet on a Sunday afternoon; and
yet, yes, amazingly, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been able to look at terror and disgust
only to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) must put away from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the bitter-sweet of their
freshness. The sight, from the window, of the group so constituted, TOLD
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) why, told her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) how, named to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), as with hard lips, named straight
AT her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) must take it full in the face, that other possible
relation to the whole fact which alone would bear upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) irresistibly.
It was extraordinary: they positively brought home to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that to feel
about them in any of the immediate, inevitable, assuaging ways, the ways
usually open to innocence outraged and generosity betrayed, would have
been to give them up, and that giving them up was, marvellously, not
to be thought of. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had never, from the first hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) state of
acquired conviction, given them up so little as now; though she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was, no
doubt, as the consequence of a step taken a few minutes later, to invoke
the conception of doing that, if might be, even less. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had resumed
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) walk--stopping here and there, while she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) rested on the cool smooth
stone balustrade, to draw it out; in the course of which, after a
little, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) passed again the lights of the empty drawing-room and paused
again for what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) saw and felt there.

<p/>It was not at once, however, that this became quite concrete; that was
the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) presently making out that Charlotte was in the room,
launched and erect there, in the middle, and looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had evidently just come round to it, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) card-table, by one of
the passages--with the expectation, to all appearance, of joining her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
stepdaughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had pulled up at seeing the great room empty--Maggie
not having passed out, on leaving the group, in a manner to be observed.
So definite a quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), with the bridge-party interrupted or altered
for it, was an impression that fairly assailed the Princess, and to
which something of attitude and aspect, of the air of arrested pursuit
and purpose, in Charlotte, together with the suggestion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) next
vague movements, quickly added its meaning. This meaning was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had decided, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been infinitely conscious of Maggie's presence
before, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would at last find her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) alone, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), for some reason, enough to have presumably called on
Bob Assingham for aid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) chair and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) go, and the
arrangement was for Maggie a signal proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) earnestness; of the
energy, in fact, that, though superficially commonplace in a situation
in which people weren't supposed to be watching each other, was what
affected our young woman, on the spot, as a breaking of bars. The
splendid shining supple creature was out of the cage, was at large; and
the question now almost grotesquely rose of whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mightn't by some
art, just where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was and before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could go further, be hemmed in
and secured. It would have been for a moment, in this case, a matter
of quickly closing the windows and giving the alarm--with poor Maggie's
sense that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) couldn't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wanted of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), it was
enough for trepidation that, at these firm hands, anything should be
to say nothing of the sequel of a flight taken again along the terrace,
even under the shame of the confessed feebleness of such evasions on the
part of an outraged wife. It was to this feebleness, none the less, that
the outraged wife had presently resorted; the most that could be
said for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) being, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) finally stopped short, at a
distance, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could at any rate resist her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) abjection sufficiently
not to sneak into the house by another way and safely reach her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had literally caught herself in the act of dodging and ducking, and
it told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) there, vividly, in a single word, what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had all along
been most afraid of.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been afraid of the particular passage with Charlotte that would
determine her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father's wife to take him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) confidence as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
couldn't possibly as yet have done, to prepare for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a statement
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wrong, to lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the infamy of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was apparently
suspected of. This, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) have made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mind to do it, would
rest on a calculation the thought of which evoked, strangely, other
possibilities and visions. It would show her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as sufficiently believing
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) grasp of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband to be able to assure herself that, with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
daughter thrown on the defensive, with Maggie's cause and Maggie's word,
in fine, against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own, it wasn't Maggie's that would most certainly
carry the day. Such a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) conceivable idea, which would be
founded on reasons all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own, reasons of experience and assurance,
impenetrable to others, but intimately familiar to herself--such a
glimpse opened out wide as soon as it had come into view; for if so much
as this was still firm ground between the elder pair, if the beauty of
appearances had been so consistently preserved, it was only the golden
bowl as Maggie herself knew it that had been broken. The breakage stood
not for any wrought discomposure among the triumphant three--it stood
merely for the dire deformity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) attitude toward them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
unable at the minute, of course, fully to measure the difference thus
involved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and it remained inevitably an agitating image, the
way it might be held over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own prudence,
satisfy Charlotte as to the reference, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mocking spirit, of so much
of the unuttered and unutterable, of the constantly and unmistakably
implied, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father would be invited without further ceremony to
recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to do so. But ANY confidence, ANY latent operating
insolence, that Mrs. Verver should, thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) large native
resources, continue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve, glimmered
suddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer, for meeting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), a new basis and something like a new system. Maggie felt, truly, a
rare contraction of the heart on making out, the next instant, what the
new system would probably have to be--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had practically done that
before perceiving that the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feared had already taken place.
Charlotte, extending her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) search, appeared now to define herself vaguely
in the distance; of this, after an instant, the Princess was sure,
though the darkness was thick, for the projected clearness of the
smoking-room windows had presently contributed its help. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) friend came
slowly into that circle--having also, for herself, by this time, not
indistinguishably discovered that Maggie was on the terrace. Maggie,
from the end, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stop before one of the windows to look at the
group within, and then saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) come nearer and pause again, still with a
considerable length of the place between them.

<p/>Yes, Charlotte had seen she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) from afar, and had stopped
now to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) further attention to the test. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) face was fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>),
through the night; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was the creature who had escaped by force from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cage, yet there was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) whole motion assuredly, even as so dimly
discerned, a kind of portentous intelligent stillness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had escaped
with an intention, but with an intention the more definite that it
could so accord with quiet measures. The two women, at all events, only
hovered there, for these first minutes, face to face over their interval
and exchanging no sign; the intensity of their mutual look might have
pierced the night, and Maggie was at last to start with the scared sense
of having thus yielded to doubt, to dread, to hesitation, for a time
that, with no other proof needed, would have completely given her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) away.
How long had she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood staring?--a single minute or five? Long enough,
in any case, to have felt herself absolutely take from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) visitor
something that the latter threw upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), irresistibly, by this effect
of silence, by this effect of waiting and watching, by this effect,
unmistakably, of timing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) indecision and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fear. If then, scared and
hanging back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had, as was so evident, sacrificed all past pretences,
it would have been with the instant knowledge of an immense advantage
gained that Charlotte finally saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) come on. Maggie came on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
heart in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) came on with the definite prevision, throbbing
like the tick of a watch, of a doom impossibly sharp and hard, but to
which, after looking at it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes wide open, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had none the
less bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head. By the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion's side, for
that matter, by the time Charlotte had, without a motion, without a
word, simply let her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) approach and stand there, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) head was already
on the block, so that the consciousness that everything had now gone
blurred all perception of whether or no the axe had fallen. Oh, the
<div class="bookquote">``advantage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Verver</b></font>)</div>it was perfectly enough, in truth, with Mrs. Verver; for
what was Maggie's own sense but that of having been thrown over on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
back, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) neck, from the first, half broken and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) helpless face
staring up? That position only could account for the positive grimace of
weakness and pain produced there by Charlotte's dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to join you--I thought you would be here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I'm here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie heard herself return a little flatly. <div class="bookquote">``It's
too close in-doors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very--but close even here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte was still and grave--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had even
uttered her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) remark about the temperature with an expressive weight that
verged upon solemnity; so that Maggie, reduced to looking vaguely about
at the sky, could only feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) not fail of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) purpose. <div class="bookquote">``The air's
heavy as if with thunder--I think there'll be a storm.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made the
suggestion to carry off an awkwardness--which was a part, always, of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion's gain; but the awkwardness didn't diminish in the silence
that followed. Charlotte had said nothing in reply; her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brow was dark
as with a fixed expression, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) high elegance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) handsome head
and long, straight neck testified, through the dusk, to their inveterate
completeness and noble erectness. It was as if what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had come out
to do had already begun, and when, as a consequence, Maggie had said
helplessly, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you want something? won't you have my shawl?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>everything might have crumbled away in the comparative poverty of the
tribute. Mrs. Verver's rejection of it had the brevity of a sign that
they hadn't closed in for idle words, just as her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) dim, serious face,
uninterruptedly presented until they moved again, might have represented
the success with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) watched all her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) message penetrate. They
presently went back the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had come, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) stopped Maggie again
within range of the smoking-room window and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stand where the
party at cards would be before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Side by side, for three minutes,
they fixed this picture of quiet harmonies, the positive charm of it
and, as might have been said, the full significance--which, as was now
brought home to Maggie, could be no more, after all, than a matter of
interpretation, differing always for a different interpreter. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
herself had hovered in sight of it a quarter-of-an-hour before, it would
have been a thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to show Charlotte--to show in righteous irony,
in reproach too stern for anything but silence. But now it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
who was being shown it, and shown it by Charlotte, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) saw quickly
enough that, as Charlotte showed it, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must at present submissively
seem to take it.

<p/>The others were absorbed and unconscious, either silent over their game
or dropping remarks unheard on the terrace; and it was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father's
quiet face, discernibly expressive of nothing that was in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter's
mind, that our young woman's attention was most directly given. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife
and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter were both closely watching him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and to which of them,
could he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) have been notified of this, would his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) raised eyes first, all
impulsively, have responded; in which of them would he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) have felt it most
important to destroy--for HIS (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) clutch at the equilibrium--any germ of
uneasiness? Not yet, since his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marriage, had Maggie so sharply and
so formidably known her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) old possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as a thing divided
and contested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by Charlotte's leave and under
Charlotte's direction; quite in fact as if the particular way she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should
look at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were prescribed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); quite, even, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been
defied to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in any other. It came home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) too that
the challenge wasn't, as might be said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) interest and for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
protection, but, pressingly, insistently, in Charlotte's, for that of
HER security at any price. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might verily, by this dumb demonstration,
have been naming to Maggie the price, naming it as a question for Maggie
herself, a sum of money that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), properly, was to find. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must remain
safe and Maggie must pay--what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was to pay with being her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own affair.

<p/>Straighter than ever, thus, the Princess again felt it all put upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and there was a minute, just a supreme instant, during which
there burned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) a wild wish that her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father would only look up. It
throbbed for these seconds as a yearning appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would chance
it, that is, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would but just raise his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes and catch them, across
the larger space, standing in the outer dark together. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might
be affected by the sight, taking them as they were; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might make some
sign--she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) scarce knew what--that would save her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>); save her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) from being
the one, this way, to pay all. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might somehow show a preference--
distinguishing between them; might, out of pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), signal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
that this extremity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) effort for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was more than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked. That
represented Maggie's one little lapse from consistency--the sole small
deflection in the whole course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) scheme. It had come to nothing the
next minute, for the dear man's eyes had never moved, and Charlotte's
hand, promptly passed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) arm, had already, had very firmly
drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) on--quite, for that matter, as from some sudden, some equal
perception on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) part too of the more ways than one in which their
impression could appeal. They retraced their steps along the rest of the
terrace, turning the corner of the house, and presently came abreast of
the other windows, those of the pompous drawing-room, still lighted and
still empty. Here Charlotte again paused, and it was again as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
were pointing out what Maggie had observed for herself, the very look
the place had of being vivid in its stillness, of having, with all its
great objects as ordered and balanced as for a formal reception, been
appointed for some high transaction, some real affair of state. In
presence of this opportunity she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) faced her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion once more; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
traced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the effect of everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had already communicated; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
signified, with the same success, that the terrace and the sullen night
would bear too meagre witness to the completion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) idea. Soon enough
then, within the room, under the old lustres of Venice and the eyes of
the several great portraits, more or less contemporary with these, that
awaited on the walls of Fawns their final far migration--soon enough
Maggie found herself staring, and at first all too gaspingly, at the
grand total to which each separate demand Mrs. Verver had hitherto made
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), however she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had made it, now amounted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been wanting--and longer than you'd perhaps believe--to put a
question to you for which no opportunity has seemed to me yet quite so
good as this. It would have been easier perhaps if you had struck me as
in the least disposed ever to give me one. I have to take it now, you
see, as I find it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>They stood in the centre of the immense room, and
Maggie could feel that the scene of life her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagination had made of it
twenty minutes before was by this time sufficiently peopled. These few
straight words filled it to its uttermost reaches, and nothing was now
absent from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) consciousness, either, of the part she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was called upon
to play in it. Charlotte had marched straight in, dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) rich
train; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) rose there beautiful and free, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) whole aspect and
action attuned to the firmness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) speech. Maggie had kept the shawl
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had taken out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and, clutching it tight in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) nervousness,
drew it round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as if huddling in it for shelter, covering herself
with it for humility. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked out as from under an improvised
hood--the sole headgear of some poor woman at somebody's proud door;
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waited even like the poor woman; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friend's eyes
with recognitions she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) couldn't suppress. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might sound it as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
could--<div class="bookquote">``What question then?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--everything in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), from head to foot,
crowded it upon Charlotte that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew too well--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
showing; so that successful vagueness, to save some scrap of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dignity
from the imminence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) defeat, was already a lost cause, and the
one thing left was if possible, at any cost, even that of stupid
inconsequence, to try to look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) weren't afraid. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could but
appear at all not afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might appear a little not ashamed--that
is not ashamed to be afraid, which was the kind of shame that could
be fastened on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), it being fear all the while that moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
challenge, at any rate, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wonder, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) terror--the blank, blurred
surface, whatever it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) presented became a mixture that ceased
to signify; for to the accumulated advantage by which Charlotte was at
present sustained her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) next words themselves had little to add.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any ground of complaint of me? Is there any wrong you consider
I've done you? I feel at last that I've a right to ask you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their eyes had to meet on it, and to meet long; Maggie's avoided at
least the disgrace of looking away. <div class="bookquote">``What makes you want to ask it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My natural desire to know. You've done that, for so long, little
justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie waited a moment. <div class="bookquote">``For so long? You mean you've thought--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, my dear, that I've seen. I've seen, week after week, that YOU
seemed to be thinking--of something that perplexed or worried you. Is it
anything for which I'm in any degree responsible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie summoned all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) powers. <div class="bookquote">``What in the world SHOULD it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's not for me to imagine, and I should be very sorry to have
to try to say! I'm aware of no point whatever at which I may have failed
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte; <div class="bookquote">``nor of any at which I may have failed any one
in whom I can suppose you sufficiently interested to care. If I've been
guilty of some fault I've committed it all unconsciously, and am only
anxious to hear from you honestly about it. But if I've been mistaken
as to what I speak of--the difference, more and more marked, as I've
thought, in all your manner to me--why, obviously, so much the
better. No form of correction received from you could give me greater
satisfaction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spoke, it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion, with rising, with extraordinary
ease; as if hearing herself say it all, besides seeing the way it was
listened to, helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) from point to point. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was right--that
this WAS the tone for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to take and the thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to do, the thing
as to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was probably feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had in advance, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) delays and uncertainties, much exaggerated the difficulty. The
difficulty was small, and it grew smaller as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) adversary continued
to shrink; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was not only doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wanted, but had by this time
effectively done it and hung it up. All of which but deepened Maggie's
sense of the sharp and simple need, now, of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) through to the
end. ```If' you've been mistaken, you say?''--and the Princess but barely
faltered. <div class="bookquote">``You HAVE been mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) splendidly hard. <div class="bookquote">``You're perfectly sure it's ALL
my mistake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All I can say is that you've received a false impression.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then--so much the better! From the moment I HAD received it I knew I
must sooner or later speak of it--for that, you see, is, systematically,
my way. And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte added, <div class="bookquote">``you make me glad I've spoken. I
thank you very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>It was strange how for Maggie too, with this, the difficulty seemed to
sink. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion's acceptance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) denial was like a general pledge
not to keep things any worse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) than they essentially had to be; it
positively helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to build up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) falsehood--to which, accordingly,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) contributed another block. <div class="bookquote">``I've affected you evidently--quite
accidentally--in some way of which I've been all unaware. I've NOT felt
at any time that you've wronged me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I come within a mile,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte inquired, <div class="bookquote">``of such a
possibility?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) more easily now, made no attempt to say;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, after a little, something more to the present point. <div class="bookquote">``I accuse
you--I accuse you of nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's lucky!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte had brought this out with the richness, almost, of gaiety; and
Maggie, to go on, had to think, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own intensity, of Amerigo--to
think how he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side, had had to go through with his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>),
how it was for his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done so, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doing so had
given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the clue and set her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the example. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own
difficulty about it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not, after all, falling below him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). It
was in fact as if, thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hovering image of him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) confronted with
this admirable creature even as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was confronted, there glowed upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from afar, yet straight and strong, a deep explanatory light which
covered the last inch of the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) something to
conform to, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hadn't unintelligently turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``gone back on''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have said, by not conforming. They were together thus,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), close, close together--whereas Charlotte, though rising
there radiantly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), was really off in some darkness of space
that would steep her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in solitude and harass her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) with care. The heart of
the Princess swelled, accordingly, even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) abasement; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had kept
in tune with the right, and something, certainly, something that might
be like a rare flower snatched from an impossible ledge, would, and
possibly soon, come of it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>). The right, the right--yes, it took
this extraordinary form of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) humbugging, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had called it, to the
end. It was only a question of not, by a hair's breadth, deflecting into
the truth. So, supremely, was she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) braced. <div class="bookquote">``You must take it from me that
your anxiety rests quite on a misconception. You must take it from
me that I've never at any moment fancied I could suffer by you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And,
marvellously, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) kept it up--not only kept it up, but improved on
it. <div class="bookquote">``You must take it from me that I've never thought of you but as
beautiful, wonderful and good. Which is all, I think, that you can
possibly ask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte held her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a moment longer: she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) needed--not then to have
appeared only tactless--the last word. <div class="bookquote">``It's much more, my dear, than I
dreamed of asking. I only wanted your denial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, you have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon your honour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my honour:''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) made a point even, our young woman, of not turning away. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
grip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shawl had loosened--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had let it fall behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
stood there for anything more and till the weight should be lifted.
With which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) saw soon enough what more was to come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) saw it in
Charlotte's face, and felt it make between them, in the air, a chill
that completed the coldness of their conscious perjury. <div class="bookquote">``Will you kiss
me on it then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't say yes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't say no; what availed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) still,
however, was to measure, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) passivity, how much too far Charlotte
had come to retreat. But there was something different also, something
for which, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cheek received the prodigious kiss, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
opportunity--the sight of the others, who, having risen from their cards
to join the absent members of their party, had reached the open door
at the end of the room and stopped short, evidently, in presence of
the demonstration that awaited them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father were in
front, and Charlotte's embrace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--which wasn't to be distinguished,
for them, either, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) embrace of Charlotte--took on with
their arrival a high publicity.



<p/>XXXVII

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), three days later, in an interval of calm, how
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was affected, in the light of their reappearance and of their now
perhaps richer fruition, by Dotty and Kitty, and by the once formidable
Mrs. Rance; and the consequence of this inquiry had been, for the pair,
just such another stroll together, away from the rest of the party and
off into the park, as had asserted its need to them on the occasion of
the previous visit of these anciently more agitating friends--that of
their long talk, on a sequestered bench beneath one of the great trees,
when the particular question had come up for them the then purblind
discussion of which, at their enjoyed leisure, Maggie had formed the
habit of regarding as the <div class="bookquote">``first beginning''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>of their present situation.
The whirligig of time had thus brought round for them again, on their
finding themselves face to face while the others were gathering for tea
on the terrace, the same odd impulse quietly to <div class="bookquote">``slope'' (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>--so Adam Verver
himself, as they went, familiarly expressed it--that had acted, in
its way, of old; acted for the distant autumn afternoon and for the
sharpness of their since so outlived crisis. It might have been funny
to them now that the presence of Mrs. Rance and the Lutches--and with
symptoms, too, at that time less developed--had once, for their anxiety
and their prudence, constituted a crisis; it might have been funny that
these ladies could ever have figured, to their imagination, as a symbol
of dangers vivid enough to precipitate the need of a remedy. This amount
of entertainment and assistance they were indeed disposed to extract
from their actual impressions; they had been finding it, for months
past, by Maggie's view, a resource and a relief to talk, with an
approach to intensity, when they met, of all the people they weren't
really thinking of and didn't really care about, the people with whom
their existence had begun almost to swarm; and they closed in at present
round the spectres of their past, as they permitted themselves to
describe the three ladies, with a better imitation of enjoying their
theme than they had been able to achieve, certainly, during the stay,
for instance, of the Castledeans. The Castledeans were a new joke,
comparatively, and they had had--always to Maggie's view--to teach
themselves the way of it; whereas the Detroit, the Providence party,
rebounding so from Providence, from Detroit, was an old and ample one,
of which the most could be made and as to which a humorous insistence
could be guarded.

<p/>Sharp and sudden, moreover, this afternoon, had been their well-nigh
confessed desire just to rest together, a little, as from some strain
long felt but never named; to rest, as who should say, shoulder to
shoulder and hand in hand, each pair of eyes so yearningly--and indeed
what could it be but so wearily?--closed as to render the collapse safe
from detection by the other pair. It was positively as if, in short, the
inward felicity of their being once more, perhaps only for half-an-hour,
simply daughter and father had glimmered out for them, and they had
picked up the pretext that would make it easiest. They were husband and
wife--oh, so immensely!--as regards other persons; but after they
had dropped again on their old bench, conscious that the party on the
terrace, augmented, as in the past, by neighbours, would do beautifully
without them, it was wonderfully like their having got together into
some boat and paddled off from the shore where husbands and wives,
luxuriant complications, made the air too tropical. In the boat they
were father and daughter, and poor Dotty and Kitty supplied abundantly,
for their situation, the oars or the sail. Why, into the bargain, for
that matter--this came to Maggie--couldn't they always live, so far as
they lived together, in a boat? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face, with the question,
the breath of a possibility that soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); they needed only KNOW each
other, henceforth, in the unmarried relation. That other sweet evening,
in the same place, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been as unmarried as possible--which had kept
down, so to speak, the quantity of change in their state. Well then,
that other sweet evening was what the present sweet evening would
resemble; with the quite calculable effect of an exquisite inward
refreshment. They HAD, after all, whatever happened, always and ever
each other; each other--that was the hidden treasure and the saving
truth--to do exactly what they would with: a provision full of
possibilities. Who could tell, as yet, what, thanks to it, they wouldn't
have done before the end?

<p/>They had meanwhile been tracing together, in the golden air that, toward
six o’clock of a July afternoon, hung about the massed Kentish woods,
several features of the social evolution of her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) old playmates, still
beckoned on, it would seem, by unattainable ideals, still falling
back, beyond the sea, to their native seats, for renewals of the moral,
financial, conversational--one scarce knew what to call it--outfit, and
again and for ever reappearing like a tribe of Wandering Jewesses. Our
couple had finally exhausted, however, the study of these annals, and
Maggie was to take up, after a drop, a different matter, or one at least
with which the immediate connection was not at first apparent. <div class="bookquote">``Were you
amused at me just now--when I wondered what other people could wish to
struggle for? Did you think me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked with some earnestness--<div class="bookquote">``well,
fatuous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>```Fatuous'?''--he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seemed at a loss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean sublime in OUR happiness--as if looking down from a height. Or,
rather, sublime in our general position--that's what I mean.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke
as from the habit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) anxious conscience something that disposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
frequently to assure herself, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) human commerce, of the state of
the <div class="bookquote">``books''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>of the spirit. <div class="bookquote">``Because I don't at all want,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) explained,
<div class="bookquote">``to be blinded, or made `sniffy,' by any sense of a social situation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father listened to this declaration as if the precautions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
general mercy could still, as they betrayed themselves, have surprises
for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--to say nothing of a charm of delicacy and beauty; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might
have been wishing to see how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could go and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would, all
touchingly to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), arrive. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) waited a little--as if made nervous,
precisely, by feeling him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) depend too much on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said. They were
avoiding the serious, standing off, anxiously, from the real, and they
fell, again and again, as if to disguise their precaution itself, into
the tone of the time that came back to them from their other talk, when
they had shared together this same refuge. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
went on, <div class="bookquote">``how, when they were here before, I broke it to you that I
wasn't so very sure we, ourselves had the thing itself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) best to do so. <div class="bookquote">``Had, you mean a social situation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--after Fanny Assingham had first broken it to me that, at the rate
we were going, we should never have one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which was what put us on Charlotte?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Oh yes, they had had it over quite
often enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) easily to remember.

<p/>Maggie had another pause--taking it from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now could both
affirm and admit without wincing that they had been, at their critical
moment, <div class="bookquote">``put on''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Charlotte. It was as if this recognition had been
threshed out between them as fundamental to the honest view of their
success. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I recall how I felt, about Kitty and
Dotty, that even if we had already then been more `placed,' or whatever
you may call what we are now, it still wouldn't have been an excuse
for wondering why others couldn't obligingly leave me more exalted
by having, themselves, smaller ideas. For those,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``were the
feelings we used to have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) responded philosophically--<div class="bookquote">``I remember the feelings we used
to have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie appeared to wish to plead for them a little, in tender
retrospect--as if they had been also respectable. <div class="bookquote">``It was bad enough, I
thought, to have no sympathy in your heart when you HAD a position. But
it was worse to be sublime about it--as I was so afraid, as I'm in fact
still afraid of being--when it wasn't even there to support one.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put forth again the earnestness she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have been taking herself
as having outlived; became for it--which was doubtless too often even
now her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) danger--almost sententious. <div class="bookquote">``One must always, whether or no,
have some imagination of the states of others--of what they may feel
deprived of. However,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Kitty and Dotty couldn't imagine we
were deprived of anything. And now, and now--!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stopped as for
indulgence to their wonder and envy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now they see, still more, that we can have got everything, and kept
everything, and yet not be proud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we're not proud,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) answered after a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure that
we're quite proud enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) changed the next instant that subject
too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could only do so, however, by harking back--as if it had been a
fascination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have been wishing, under this renewed, this still
more suggestive visitation, to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for remounting the
stream of time and dipping again, for the softness of the water, into
the contracted basin of the past. <div class="bookquote">``We talked about it--we talked about
it; you don't remember so well as I. You too didn't know--and it
was beautiful of you; like Kitty and Dotty you too thought we had a
position, and were surprised when _I_ thought we ought to have told them
we weren't doing for them what they supposed. In fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie pursued,
<div class="bookquote">``we're not doing it now. We're not, you see, really introducing them. I
mean not to the people they want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what do you call the people with whom they're now having tea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) quite spring round. <div class="bookquote">``That's just what you asked me the other
time--one of the days there was somebody. And I told you I didn't call
anybody anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember--that such people, the people we made so welcome, didn't
`count'; that Fanny Assingham knew they didn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had awakened, his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
daughter, the echo; and on the bench there, as before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
head amusedly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept nervously shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) foot. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, they were only
good enough--the people who came--for US. I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said again:
<div class="bookquote">``that was the way it all happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was the way--that was the way. And you asked me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie
added, <div class="bookquote">``if I didn't think we ought to tell them. Tell Mrs. Rance, in
particular, I mean, that we had been entertaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) up to then under
false pretences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely--but you said she (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) wouldn't have understood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To which you replied that in that case you were like her (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>). YOU didn't
understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no--but I remember how, about our having, in our benighted
innocence, no position, you quite crushed me with your explanation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie with every appearance of delight, <div class="bookquote">``I'll crush
you again. I told you that you by yourself had one--there was no doubt
of that. You were different from me--you had the same one you always
had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And THEN I asked you,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father concurred, <div class="bookquote">``why in that case you
hadn't the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then indeed you did.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face round to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) before, and
this held it, covering him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with its kindled brightness, the result of
the attested truth of their being able thus, in talk, to live again
together. <div class="bookquote">``What I replied was that I had lost my position by my
marriage. THAT one--I know how I saw it--would never come back. I had
done something TO it--I didn't quite know what; given it away, somehow,
and yet not, as then appeared, really got my return. I had been
assured--always by dear Fanny--that I COULD get it, only I must wake up.
So I was trying, you see, to wake up--trying very hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--and to a certain extent you succeeded; as also in waking me. But
you made much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``of your difficulty.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added:
<div class="bookquote">``It's the only case I remember, Mag, of you ever making ANYTHING of a
difficulty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``That I was so happy as I was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you were so happy as you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you admitted'' (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>--Maggie kept it up--<div class="bookquote">``that that was a good
difficulty. You confessed that our life did seem to be beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--I may very well have confessed it, for so it
did seem to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) guarded himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dim, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) easier smile.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you want to put on me now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only that we used to wonder--that we were wondering then--if our life
wasn't perhaps a little selfish.''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>This also for a time, much at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
leisure, Adam Verver retrospectively fixed. <div class="bookquote">``Because Fanny Assingham
thought so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) couldn't think, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would, anything
of that sort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) only thinks people are sometimes fools,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie
developed; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doesn't seem to think so much about their being
wrong--wrong, that is, in the sense of being wicked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doesn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>the
Princess further adventured, <div class="bookquote">``quite so much mind their being wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see--I see.''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>And yet it might have been for his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
didn't so very vividly see. <div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) only thought US fools?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no--I don't say that. I'm speaking of our being selfish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that comes under the head of the wickedness Fanny condones?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't say she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) CONDONES--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>A scruple in Maggie raised its crest.
<div class="bookquote">``Besides, I'm speaking of what was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father showed, however, after a little, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not been reached
by this discrimination; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thoughts were resting for the moment where
they had settled. <div class="bookquote">``Look here, Mag,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said reflectively--<div class="bookquote">``I ain't
selfish. I'll be blowed if I'm selfish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, Maggie, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) WOULD talk of that, could also pronounce. <div class="bookquote">``Then,
father, _I_ am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh shucks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>said Adam Verver, to whom the vernacular, in moments of
deepest sincerity, could thus come back. <div class="bookquote">``I'll believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) presently
added, <div class="bookquote">``when Amerigo complains of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, it's just he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) who's my selfishness. I'm selfish, so to speak, FOR
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s my motive--in everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father could, from experience, fancy what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) meant. <div class="bookquote">``But
hasn't a girl a right to be selfish about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I DON'T mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) observed without answering, <div class="bookquote">``is that I'm
jealous of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). But that's his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) merit--it's not mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father again seemed amused at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You COULD be--otherwise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how can I talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``of otherwise? It ISN'T, luckily for
me, otherwise. If everything were different'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) further presented her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
thought--<div class="bookquote">``of course everything WOULD be.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then again, as if that
were but half: <div class="bookquote">``My idea is this, that when you only love a little you're
naturally not jealous--or are only jealous also a little, so that it
doesn't matter. But when you love in a deeper and intenser way, then you
are, in the same proportion, jealous; your jealousy has intensity and,
no doubt, ferocity. When, however, you love in the most abysmal and
unutterable way of all--why then you're beyond everything, and nothing
can pull you down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Verver listened as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had nothing, on these high lines, to
oppose. <div class="bookquote">``And that's the way YOU love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For a minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) failed to speak, but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't
to talk about that. I do FEEL, however, beyond everything--and as a
consequence of that, I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added with a turn to gaiety, <div class="bookquote">``seem
often not to know quite WHERE I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The mere fine pulse of passion in it, the suggestion as of a creature
consciously floating and shining in a warm summer sea, some element of
dazzling sapphire and silver, a creature cradled upon depths, buoyant
among dangers, in which fear or folly, or sinking otherwise than in
play, was impossible--something of all this might have been making once
more present to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) discreet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) half shy assent to it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
probable enjoyment of a rapture that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) day, had presumably
convinced no great number of persons either of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) giving or of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) receiving. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat awhile as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew himself hushed, almost
admonished, and not for the first time; yet it was an effect that might
have brought before him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rather what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had gained than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
missed.

<p/>Besides, who but himself really knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), after all, hadn't, or even
had, gained? The beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) condition was keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), at any rate,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might feel, in sight of the sea, where, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) personal dips
were over, the whole thing could shine at him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and the air and the plash
and the play become for him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) too a sensation. That couldn't be fixed upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as missing; since if it wasn't personally floating, if it wasn't
even sitting in the sand, it could yet pass very well for breathing
the bliss, in a communicated irresistible way--for tasting the balm. It
could pass, further, for knowing--for knowing that without him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) nothing
might have been: which would have been missing least of all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess I've never been jealous,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) finally remarked. And it said more
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had occasion next to perceive, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was intending; for it
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as by the pressure of a spring, give him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a look that seemed to
tell of things she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) couldn't speak.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at last tried for one of them. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's you, father, who are
what I call beyond everything. Nothing can pull YOU down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) returned the look as with the sociability of their easy communion,
though inevitably throwing in this time a shade of solemnity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
might have been seeing things to say, and others, whether of a type
presumptuous or not, doubtless better kept back. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) settled on the
merely obvious. <div class="bookquote">``Well then, we make a pair. We're all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we're all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A declaration launched not only with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
discriminating emphasis, but confirmed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) rising with decision
and standing there as if the object of their small excursion required
accordingly no further pursuit. At this juncture, however--with the
act of their crossing the bar, to get, as might be, into port--there
occurred the only approach to a betrayal of their having had to beat
against the wind. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father kept his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) place, and it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
got over first and were pausing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) consort to follow. If they were
all right; they were all right; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed to hesitate and wait for
some word beyond. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes met her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own, suggestively, and it was only
after she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had contented herself with simply smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), smiling ever
so fixedly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke, for the remaining importance of it, from the
bench; where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) leaned back, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) legs thrust
out a trifle wearily and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands grasping either side of the seat.
They had beaten against the wind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was still fresh; they had
beaten against the wind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), as at the best the more battered
vessel, perhaps just vaguely drooped. But the effect of their silence
was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) appeared to beckon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might have been fairly
alongside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) when, at the end of another minute, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found their
word. <div class="bookquote">``The only thing is that, as for ever putting up again with your
pretending that you're selfish--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At this she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out with it. <div class="bookquote">``You won't take it from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't take it from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, of course you won't, for that's your way. It doesn't matter, and
it only proves--! But it doesn't matter, either, what it proves. I'm at
this very moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) declared, <div class="bookquote">``frozen stiff with selfishness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) faced her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) awhile longer in the same way; it was, strangely, as if, by
this sudden arrest, by their having, in their acceptance of the unsaid,
or at least their reference to it, practically given up pretending--it
was as if they were <div class="bookquote">``in''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>for it, for something they had been ineffably
avoiding, but the dread of which was itself, in a manner, a seduction,
just as any confession of the dread was by so much an allusion. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seemed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) let himself go. <div class="bookquote">``When a person's of the nature you
speak of there are always other persons to suffer. But you've just been
describing to me what you'd take, if you had once a good chance, from
your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not talking about my husband!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then whom, ARE you talking about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Both the retort and the rejoinder had come quicker than anything
previously exchanged, and they were followed, on Maggie's part, by a
momentary drop. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not to fall away, and while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion
kept his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) weren't expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to
name his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) wife then, with high hypocrisy, as paying for his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) daughter's
bliss, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) produced something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt to be much better. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
talking about YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean I've been your victim?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you've been my victim. What have you done, ever done, that
hasn't been FOR me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Many things; more than I can tell you--things you've only to think of
for yourself. What do you make of all that I've done for myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Yourself'?--'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brightened out with derision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you make of what I've done for American City?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) but a moment to say. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not talking of you as a public
character--I'm talking of you on your personal side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, American City--if `personalities' can do it--has given me a
pretty personal side. What do you make,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``of what I've done
for my reputation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your reputation THERE? You've given it up to them, the awful people,
for less than nothing; you've given it up to them to tear to pieces, to
make their horrible vulgar jokes against you with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear, I don't care for their horrible vulgar jokes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>Adam Verver
almost artlessly urged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there, exactly, you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) triumphed. <div class="bookquote">``Everything that
touches you, everything that surrounds you, goes on--by your splendid
indifference and your incredible permission--at your expense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had been sitting he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) an instant longer; then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) slowly rose, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) hands stole into his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) pockets, and stood there
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Of course, my dear, YOU go on at my expense: it has never
been my idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``that you should work for your living. I
wouldn't have liked to see it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With which, for a little again, they
remained face to face. <div class="bookquote">``Say therefore I HAVE had the feelings of a
father. How have they made me a victim?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I sacrifice you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But to what in the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At this it hung before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should have had as never yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
opportunity to say, and it held her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for a minute as in a vise, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) now, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) strained smile, which touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to
deepest depths, sounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) secret unrest. This was the moment,
in the whole process of their mutual vigilance, in which it decidedly
most hung by a hair that their thin wall might be pierced by the
lightest wrong touch. It shook between them, this transparency, with
their very breath; it was an exquisite tissue, but stretched on a frame,
and would give way the next instant if either so much as breathed too
hard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) breath, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew by his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) eyes, the light at the
heart of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) couldn't blind, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) intention, making
sure--sure whether or no her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) certainty was like his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>). The intensity of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) dependence on it at that moment--this itself was what absolutely
convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) so that, as if perched up before him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) vertiginous
point and in the very glare of his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) observation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) balanced for thirty
seconds, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) almost rocked: she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have been for the time, in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
conscious person, the very form of the equilibrium they were, in their
different ways, equally trying to save. And they were saving it--yes,
they were, or at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was: that was still the workable issue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
could say, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) dizziness drop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held herself hard; the
thing was to be done, once for all, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) acting, now, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood.
So much was crowded into so short a space that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew already she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had kept it by the warning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
shouldn't lose it again; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew how and why, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had turned
cold this was precisely what helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had said to himself <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'ll
break down and name Amerigo; she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'ll say it's to him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s sacrificing
me; and its by what that will give me--with so many other things
too--that my suspicion will be clinched.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lips,
spying for the symptoms of the sound; whereby these symptoms had only to
fail and he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have got nothing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't measure out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gave it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had presently in fact so recovered herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
seemed to know she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could more easily have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) name his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wife than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) name her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband. It was there before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) should so much as force him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) just NOT consciously to avoid saying
<div class="bookquote">``Charlotte, Charlotte''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) would have given himself away. But to be sure
of this was enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw more clearly with each lapsing
instant what they were both doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had steadily
been coming to; he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was practically OFFERING himself, pressing himself
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), as a sacrifice--he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had read his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way so into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) best
possibility; and where had she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) already, for weeks and days past, planted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) feet if not on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) acceptance of the offer? Cold indeed, colder and
colder she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt herself suffer this close personal
vision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) attitude still not to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) weaken. That was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) very
certitude, the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pressure; for if something dreadful
hadn't happened there wouldn't, for either of them, be these dreadful
things to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had meanwhile, as well, the immense advantage that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could have named Charlotte without exposing herself--as, for that
matter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was the next minute showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I sacrifice you, simply, to everything and to every one. I take
the consequences of your marriage as perfectly natural.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head a little, settling with one hand his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyeglass.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you call, my dear, the consequences?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your life as your marriage has made it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, hasn't it made it exactly what we wanted?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) just hesitated,
then felt herself steady--oh, beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had dreamed. <div class="bookquote">``Exactly what
_I_ wanted--yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes, through his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) straightened glasses, were still on hers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
might, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) intenser fixed smile, have been knowing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was, for
herself, rightly inspired. <div class="bookquote">``What do you make then of what I wanted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't make anything, any more than of what you've got. That's exactly
the point. I don't put myself out to do so--I never have; I take from
you all I can get, all you've provided for me, and I leave you to make
of your own side of the matter what you can. There you are--the rest is
your own affair. I don't even pretend to concern myself--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To concern yourself--?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) faintly faltered, looking
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) now so as not to keep always meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With what may have REALLY become of you. It's as if we had agreed
from the first not to go into that--such an arrangement being of course
charming for ME. You can't say, you know, that I haven't stuck to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't say so then--even with the opportunity given him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
stopping once more to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said instead: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my
dear--oh, oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>But it made no difference, know as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might what a past--still so
recent and yet so distant--it alluded to; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) denial,
warning him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) off, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side, from spoiling the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) contention.
<div class="bookquote">``I never went into anything, and you see I don't; I've continued to
adore you--but what's that, from a decent daughter to such a father?
what but a question of convenient arrangement, our having two houses,
three houses, instead of one -LRB-you would have arranged for fifty if I
had wished!-RRB- and my making it easy for you to see the child? You don't
claim, I suppose, that my natural course, once you had set up for
yourself, would have been to ship you back to American City?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>These were direct inquiries, they quite rang out, in the soft, wooded
air; so that Adam Verver, for a minute, appeared to meet them with
reflection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw reflection, however, quickly enough show him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) what
to do with them. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Mag, what you make me wish when you talk
that way?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) waited again, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) further got from him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) the
sense of something that had been behind, deeply in the shade, coming
cautiously to the front and just feeling its way before presenting
itself. <div class="bookquote">``You regularly make me wish that I had shipped back to American
City. When you go on as you do--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) really had to hold himself to
say it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, when I go on--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you make me quite want to ship back myself. You make me quite feel
as if American City would be the best place for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) all too finely vibrate. <div class="bookquote">``For `us'--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For me and Charlotte. Do you know that if we should ship, it would
serve you quite right?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With which he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) smiled--oh he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) smiled! <div class="bookquote">``And if you
say much more we WILL ship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah, then it was that the cup of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) conviction, full to the brim,
overflowed at a touch! THERE was his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) idea, the clearness of which for
an instant almost dazzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). It was a blur of light, in the midst
of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw Charlotte like some object marked, by contrast, in
blackness, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) waver in the field of vision, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) removed,
transported, doomed. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had named Charlotte, named her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) again, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had MADE him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)--which was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had needed more: it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had held a blank letter to the fire and the writing had come out still
larger than she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hoped. The recognition of it took her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) some seconds, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spoke have been folding up these precious lines and
restoring them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I shall be as much as ever then the
cause of what you do. I haven't the least doubt of your being up to
that if you should think I might get anything out of it; even the little
pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``of having said, as you call it, `more.' Let my
enjoyment of this therefore, at any price, continue to represent for you
what _I_ call sacrificing you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had drawn a long breath; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) do it ALL for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and had
lighted the way to it without his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) naming her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband. That silence had
been as distinct as the sharp, the inevitable sound, and something now,
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), followed it up, a sudden air as of confessing at last fully to
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was and of begging the particular question. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think
then I can take care of myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, it's exactly what I've gone upon. If it wasn't for that--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) broke off, and they remained only another moment face to face.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll let you know, my dear, the day _I_ feel you've begun to sacrifice
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Begun'?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) extravagantly echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it will be, for me, the day you've ceased to believe in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>With which, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) glasses still fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) pockets,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) hat pushed back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) legs a little apart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) seemed to plant or to
square himself for a kind of assurance it had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) might
as well treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to, in default of other things, before they changed
their subject. It had the effect, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), of a reminder--a reminder of
all he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was, of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had done, of all, above and beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) being her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
perfect little father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might take him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) as representing, take him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) as
having, quite eminently, in the eyes of two hemispheres, been capable
of, and as therefore wishing, not--was it?--illegitimately, to call
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) attention to. The <div class="bookquote">``successful,''  (<font color='red'><b>The person citizen collector authority</b></font>)</div>beneficent person, the beautiful,
bountiful, original, dauntlessly wilful great citizen, the consummate
collector and infallible high authority he (<font color='blue'><b>collector</b></font>) had been and still was--these
things struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), on the spot, as making up for him (<font color='blue'><b>collector</b></font>), in a wonderful
way, a character she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must take into account in dealing with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) either
for pity or for envy. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) positively, under the impression, seemed to
loom larger than life for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) during these moments
in a light of recognition which had had its brightness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) at many
an hour of the past, but which had never been so intense and so almost
admonitory. His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) very quietness was part of it now, as always part of
everything, of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) success, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) originality, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) modesty, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) exquisite
public perversity, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) inscrutable, incalculable energy; and this
quality perhaps it might be--all the more too as the result, for the
present occasion, of an admirable, traceable effort--that placed him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes as no precious a work of art probably had ever been placed
in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own. There was a long moment, absolutely, during which her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
impression rose and rose, even as that of the typical charmed gazer, in
the still museum, before the named and dated object, the pride of the
catalogue, that time has polished and consecrated. Extraordinary,
in particular, was the number of the different ways in which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thus
affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as showing. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was strong--that was the great thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
was sure--sure for himself, always, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) idea: the expression
of that in him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had somehow never appeared more identical with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) proved
taste for the rare and the true. But what stood out beyond everything
was that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was always, marvellously, young--which couldn't but crown,
at this juncture, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) whole appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) imagination. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew
it she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was lifted aloft by the consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was simply a great
and deep and high little man, and that to love him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) with tenderness was
not to be distinguished, a whit, from loving him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) with pride. It came to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), all strangely, as a sudden, an immense relief. The sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
wasn't a failure, and could never be, purged their predicament of every
meanness--made it as if they had really emerged, in their transmuted
union, to smile almost without pain. It was like a new confidence, and
after another instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew even still better why. Wasn't it because
now, also, on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) side, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) daughter, was
TRYING her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), during these mute seconds, as the child of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) blood? Oh
then, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wasn't with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) little conscious passion, the child of any
weakness, what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) but strong enough too? It swelled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>),
fairly; it raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) higher, higher: she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wasn't in that case a failure
either--hadn't been, but the contrary; his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) strength was her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) strength,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pride was his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and they were decent and competent together. This was
all in the answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) finally made him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe in you more than any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Than any one at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hesitated, for all it might mean; but there was--oh a thousand
times!--no doubt of it. <div class="bookquote">``Than any one at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) kept nothing of it
back now, met his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) eyes over it, let him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) have the whole of it; after
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``And that's the way, I think, you believe in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a minute longer, but his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) tone at last was right. <div class="bookquote">``About
the way--yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then--?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spoke as for the end and for other matters--for
anything, everything, else there might be. They would never return to
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hands came out, and while her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own took them he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) drew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) breast and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hard and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) long, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) let herself go; but it was an embrace that, august and almost
stern, produced, for all its intimacy, no revulsion and broke into no
inconsequence of tears.



<p/>XXXVIII

<p/>Maggie was to feel, after this passage, how they had both been helped
through it by the influence of that accident of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) having been caught,
a few nights before, in the familiar embrace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's wife.
His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) return to the saloon had chanced to coincide exactly with this
demonstration, missed moreover neither by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband nor by
the Assinghams, who, their card-party suspended, had quitted the
billiard-room with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been conscious enough at the time of
what such an impression, received by the others, might, in that extended
state, do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) case; and none the less that, as no one had appeared
to wish to be the first to make a remark about it, it had taken on
perceptibly the special shade of consecration conferred by unanimities
of silence. The effect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have considered, had been almost
awkward--the promptitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) separation from Charlotte, as if
they had been discovered in some absurdity, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) becoming aware
of spectators. The spectators, on the other hand--that was the
appearance--mightn't have supposed them, in the existing relation,
addicted to mutual endearments; and yet, hesitating with a fine scruple
between sympathy and hilarity, must have felt that almost any spoken
or laughed comment could be kept from sounding vulgar only by sounding,
beyond any permitted measure, intelligent. They had evidently looked,
the two young wives, like a pair of women <div class="bookquote">``making up''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>effusively, as
women were supposed to do, especially when approved fools, after
a broil; but taking note of the reconciliation would imply, on
her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) father's part, on Amerigo's, and on Fanny Assingham's, some
proportionate vision of the grounds of their difference. There had
been something, there had been but too much, in the incident, for each
observer; yet there was nothing any one could have said without
seeming essentially to say: <div class="bookquote">``See, see, the dear things--their quarrel's
blissfully over!''  (<font color='red'><b>each observer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Our quarrel? What quarrel?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the dear things
themselves would necessarily, in that case, have demanded; and the
wits of the others would thus have been called upon for some agility of
exercise. No one had been equal to the flight of producing, off-hand, a
fictive reason for any estrangement--to take, that is, the place of the
true, which had so long, for the finer sensibility, pervaded the air;
and every one, accordingly, not to be inconveniently challenged, was
pretending, immediately after, to have remarked nothing that any one
else hadn't.

<p/>Maggie's own measure had remained, all the same, full of the reflection
caught from the total inference; which had acted, virtually, by enabling
every one present--and oh Charlotte not least!--to draw a long breath.
The message of the little scene had been different for each, but it
had been this, markedly, all round, that it reinforced--reinforced even
immensely--the general effort, carried on from week to week and of late
distinctly more successful, to look and talk and move as if nothing in
life were the matter. Supremely, however, while this glass was held
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), had Maggie's sense turned to the quality of the success
constituted, on the spot, for Charlotte. Most of all, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
guessing how her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father must have secretly started, how her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband must
have secretly wondered, how Fanny Assingham must have secretly, in
a flash, seen daylight for herself--most of all had she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) tasted, by
communication, of the high profit involved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
FELT, in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) pulses, Charlotte feel it, and how publicity had been
required, absolutely, to crown her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own abasement. It was the added
touch, and now nothing was wanting--which, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stepmother
justice, Mrs. Verver had appeared but to desire, from that evening, to
show, with the last vividness, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) recognised. Maggie lived over
again the minutes in question--had found herself repeatedly doing so; to
the degree that the whole evening hung together, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aftersense, as
a thing appointed by some occult power that had dealt with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), that had
for instance--animated the four with just the right restlessness too,
had decreed and directed and exactly timed it in them, making their
game of bridge--however abysmal a face it had worn for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--give way,
precisely, to their common unavowed impulse to find out, to emulate
Charlotte's impatience; a preoccupation, this latter, attached
detectedly to the member of the party who was roaming in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) queerness
and was, for all their simulated blindness, not roaming unnoted.

<p/>If Mrs. Verver meanwhile, then, had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) as determined in a
certain direction by the last felicity into which that night had
flowered, our young woman was yet not to fail of appreciating the truth
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not been put at ease, after all, with absolute permanence.
Maggie had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), unmistakably, desire to rise to the occasion and
be magnificent--seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) decide that the right way for this would be to
prove that the reassurance she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had extorted there, under the high, cool
lustre of the saloon, a twinkle of crystal and silver, had not only
poured oil upon the troubled waters of their question, but had fairly
drenched their whole intercourse with that lubricant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had exceeded
the limit of discretion in this insistence on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) capacity to repay
in proportion a service she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) acknowledged as handsome. <div class="bookquote">``Why handsome?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie would have been free to ask; since if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been veracious the
service assuredly would not have been huge. It would in that case have
come up vividly, and for each of them alike, that the truth, on the
Princess's lips, presented no difficulty. If the latter's mood, in fact,
could have turned itself at all to private gaiety it might have failed
to resist the diversion of seeing so clever a creature so beguiled.
Charlotte's theory of a generous manner was manifestly to express that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stepdaughter's word, wiping out, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might have said, everything,
had restored them to the serenity of a relation without a cloud. It had
been, in short, in this light, ideally conclusive, so that no ghost of
anything it referred to could ever walk again. What was the ecstasy of
that, however, but in itself a trifle compromising?--as truly, within
the week, Maggie had occasion to suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend of beginning,
and rather abruptly, to remember. Convinced as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was of the example
already given her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband, and in relation to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
profession of trust in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mistress had been an act of conformity
exquisitely calculated, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) imagination yet sought in the hidden play of
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) influence the explanation of any change of surface, any difference
of expression or intention. There had been, through life, as we know,
few quarters in which the Princess's fancy could let itself loose; but
it shook off restraint when it plunged into the figured void of
the detail of that relation. This was a realm it could people with
images--again and again with fresh ones; they swarmed there like the
strange combinations that lurked in the woods at twilight; they loomed
into the definite and faded into the vague, their main present sign
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) being, however, that they were always, that they were duskily,
agitated. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) earlier vision of a state of bliss made insecure by the
very intensity of the bliss--this had dropped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had ceased
to see, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) lost herself, the pair of operatic, of high Wagnerian
lovers -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) found, deep within her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), these comparisons-RRB- interlocked in
their wood of enchantment, a green glade as romantic as one's dream of
an old German forest. The picture was veiled, on the contrary, with
the dimness of trouble; behind which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) felt, indistinguishable, the
procession of forms that had lost, all so pitifully, their precious
confidence. Therefore, though there was in these days, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), with
Amerigo, little enough even of the imitation, from day to day, of
unembarrassed references--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had foreseen, for that matter, from the
first, that there would be--her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) active conception of his (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) accessibility
to their companion's own private and unextinguished right to break
ground was not much less active than before. So it was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) inner
sense, in spite of everything, represented him (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) as still pulling wires
and controlling currents, or rather indeed as muffling the whole
possibility, keeping it down and down, leading his (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) accomplice
continually on to some new turn of the road. As regards herself Maggie
had become more conscious from week to week of his (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) ingenuities of
intention to make up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) for their forfeiture, in so dire a degree,
of any reality of frankness--a privation that had left on his (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) lips
perhaps a little of the same thirst with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fairly felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own
distorted, the torment of the lost pilgrim who listens in desert sands
for the possible, the impossible, plash of water. It was just this
hampered state in him (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>), none the less, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
wished most to find grounds of dignity for the hard little passion
which nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) had done could smother. There were hours enough,
lonely hours, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) let dignity go; then there were others when,
clinging with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) winged concentration to some deep cell of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stored away her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hived tenderness as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had gathered it all from
flowers. He (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) was walking ostensibly beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), but in fact given over,
without a break, to the grey medium in which he (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) helplessly groped; a
perception on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) part which was a perpetual pang and which might last
what it would--for ever if need be--but which, if relieved at all, must
be relieved by his (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) act alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) herself could do nothing more for it;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done the utmost possible. It was meantime not the easier to bear
for this aspect under which Charlotte was presented as depending on him (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>)
for guidance, taking it from him (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) even in doses of bitterness, and yet
lost with him (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) in devious depths. Nothing was thus more sharply to be
inferred than that he (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) had promptly enough warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), on hearing from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) of the precious assurance received from his (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) wife, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must take
care her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) satisfaction didn't betray something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) danger. Maggie
had a day of still waiting, after allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) time to learn how
unreservedly she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had lied for him (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>)--of waiting as for the light of she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
scarce knew what slow-shining reflection of this knowledge in his (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>)
personal attitude. What retarded evolution, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked herself in these
hours, mightn't poor Charlotte all unwittingly have precipitated? She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
was thus poor Charlotte again for Maggie even while Maggie's own head
was bowed, and the reason for this kept coming back to our young woman
in the conception of what would secretly have passed. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
face to face with the Prince, take from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) the chill of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) stiffest
admonition, with the possibilities of deeper difficulty that it
represented for each. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ask, irritated and sombre, what
tone, in God's name--since her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bravery didn't suit him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was then
to adopt; and, by way of a fantastic flight of divination, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard
Amerigo reply, in a voice of which every fine note, familiar and
admirable, came home to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), that one must really manage such prudences
a little for one's self. It was positive in the Princess that, for this,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) breathed Charlotte's cold air--turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in it with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), turned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), in growing compassion, this way and that, hovered
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) ask herself where then she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) should rest.
Marvellous the manner in which, under such imaginations, Maggie thus
circled and lingered--quite as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were, materially, following
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) unseen, counting every step she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) helplessly wasted, noting every
hindrance that brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to a pause.

<p/>A few days of this, accordingly, had wrought a change in that
apprehension of the instant beatitude of triumph--of triumph magnanimous
and serene--with which the upshot of the night-scene on the terrace had
condemned our young woman to make terms. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had had, as we know, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
vision of the gilt bars bent, of the door of the cage forced open from
within and the creature imprisoned roaming at large--a movement, on
the creature's part, that was to have even, for the short interval, its
impressive beauty, but of which the limit, and in yet another direction,
had loomed straight into view during her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) last talk under the great trees
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father. It was when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife's face ruefully attached
to the quarter to which, in the course of their session, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had so
significantly addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own--it was then that Maggie could watch for
its turning pale, it was then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seemed to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had meant
by thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), in she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) shadow of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) most ominous reference, as
<div class="bookquote">``doomed.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>If, as I say, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) attention now, day after day, so circled and
hovered, it found itself arrested for certain passages during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
absolutely looked with Charlotte's grave eyes. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) unfailingly made
out through them was the figure of a little quiet gentleman who mostly
wore, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) moved, alone, across the field of vision, a straw hat, a
white waistcoat and a blue necktie, keeping a cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) teeth and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pockets, and who, oftener than not, presented a somewhat
meditative back while he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) slowly measured the perspectives of the park
and broodingly counted -LRB-it might have appeared-RRB- his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) steps. There were
hours of intensity, for a week or two, when it was for all the world as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had guardedly tracked her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stepmother, in the great house, from
room to room and from window to window, only to see her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), here and there
and everywhere, TRY her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) uneasy outlook, question her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) issue and her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fate.
Something, unmistakably, had come up for her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that had never come
up before; it represented a new complication and had begotten a new
anxiety--things, these, that she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) carried about with her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) done up in the
napkin of her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lover's accepted rebuke, while she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) vainly hunted for some
corner where she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might put them safely down. The disguised solemnity,
the prolonged futility of her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) search might have been grotesque to a more
ironic eye; but Maggie's provision of irony, which we have taken for
naturally small, had never been so scant as now, and there were moments
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) watched with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), thus unseen, when the mere effect of being
near her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own heart in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) throat, was to be almost
moved to saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Hold on tight, my poor dear--without TOO MUCH
terror--and it will all come out somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Even to that indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could reflect, Charlotte might have replied
that it was easy to say; even to that no great meaning could attach so
long as the little meditative man in the straw hat kept coming into view
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indescribable air of weaving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spell, weaving it off there by
himself. In whatever quarter of the horizon the appearances were scanned
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to be noticed as absorbed in this occupation; and Maggie was to
become aware of two or three extraordinary occasions of receiving from
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) measured the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) produced. It was not
really till after their recent long talk in the park that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew how
deeply, how quite exhaustively, they had then communicated--so that they
were to remain together, for the time, in consequence, quite in the form
of a couple of sociable drinkers who sit back from the table over which
they have been resting their elbows, over which they have emptied to the
last drop their respective charged cups. The cups were still there
on the table, but turned upside down; and nothing was left for the
companions but to confirm by placid silences the fact that the wine had
been good. They had parted, positively, as if, on either side, primed
with it--primed for whatever was to be; and everything between them, as
the month waned, added its touch of truth to this similitude. Nothing,
truly, WAS at present between them save that they were looking at each
other in infinite trust; it fairly wanted no more words, and when they
met, during the deep summer days, met even without witnesses, when
they kissed at morning and evening, or on any of the other occasions of
contact that they had always so freely celebrated, a pair of birds of
the upper air could scarce have appeared less to invite each other to
sit down and worry afresh. So it was that in the house itself, where
more of his (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) waiting treasures than ever were provisionally ranged, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
sometimes only looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>)--from end to end of the great gallery,
the pride of the house, for instance--as if, in one of the halls of a
museum, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had been an earnest young woman with a Baedeker and he (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) a
vague gentleman to whom even Baedekers were unknown. He (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) had ever, of
course, had his (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) way of walking about to review his (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) possessions and
verify their condition; but this was a pastime to which he (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) now struck
her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) as almost extravagantly addicted, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) passed near him (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) and
he (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) turned to give her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) a smile she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) caught--or so she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) fancied--the greater
depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) small, perpetual hum of contemplation. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>)
were singing to himself, sotto voce, as he (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) went--and it was also,
on occasion, quite ineffably, as if Charlotte, hovering, watching,
listening, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) side too, kept sufficiently within earshot to make it
out as song, and yet, for some reason connected with the very manner of
it, stood off and didn't dare.

<p/>One of the attentions she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had from immediately after her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) marriage
most freely paid him (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) was that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) rarities, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
appreciation of his (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) taste, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) native passion for beautiful objects and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) grateful desire not to miss anything he (<font color='blue'><b>witnesses</b></font>) could teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) about them.
Maggie had in due course seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) begin to <div class="bookquote">``work''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>this fortunately
natural source of sympathy for all it was worth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took possession of
the mound throughout its extent; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) abounded, to odd excess, one might
have remarked, in the assumption of its being for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband,
ALL the ground, the finest, clearest air and most breathable medium
common to them. It had been given to Maggie to wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't, in
these intensities of approbation, too much shut him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) up to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) province;
but this was a complaint he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had never made his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) daughter, and Charlotte
must at least have had for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) that, thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) admirable instinct,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) range of perception marching with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own and never falling behind,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had probably not so much as once treated him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to a rasping mistake or
a revealing stupidity. Maggie, wonderfully, in the summer days, felt
it forced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) that that was one way, after all, of being a genial
wife; and it was never so much forced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as at these odd moments
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) encountering the sposi, as Amerigo called them, under the coved
ceilings of Fawns while, so together, yet at the same time so separate,
they were making their daily round. Charlotte hung behind, with
emphasised attention; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stopped when her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband stopped, but at the
distance of a case or two, or of whatever other succession of objects;
and the likeness of their connection would not have been wrongly figured
if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been thought of as holding in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pocketed hands the
end of a long silken halter looped round her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) beautiful neck. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) didn't
twitch it, yet it was there; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) didn't drag her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) came; and those
indications that I have described the Princess as finding extraordinary
in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were two or three mute facial intimations which his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's
presence didn't prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) daughter--nor prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
daughter, as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) passed, it was doubtless to be added, from flushing
a little at the receipt of. They amounted perhaps only to a wordless,
wordless smile, but the smile was the soft shake of the twisted silken
rope, and Maggie's translation of it, held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) breast till she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) got
well away, came out only, as if it might have been overheard, when some
door was closed behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you see--I lead her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) now by the neck, I
lead her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) doom, and she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) doesn't so much as know what it is, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) has a fear in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) heart which, if you had the chances to apply your
ear there that I, as a husband, have, you would hear thump and thump and
thump. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) thinks it MAY be, her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) doom, the awful place over there--awful
for HER; but she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s afraid to ask, don't you see? just as she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s afraid of
not asking; just as she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s afraid of so many other things that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
sees multiplied round her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) now as portents and betrayals. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'ll know,
however--when she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) does know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte's one opportunity, meanwhile, for the air of confidence she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had formerly worn so well and that agreed so with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) firm and charming
type, was the presence of visitors, never, as the season advanced,
wholly intermitted--rather, in fact, so constant, with all the people
who turned up for luncheon and for tea and to see the house, now
replete, now famous, that Maggie grew to think again of this large
element of <div class="bookquote">``company''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>as of a kind of renewed water-supply for the tank
in which, like a party of panting gold-fish, they kept afloat. It helped
them, unmistakably, with each other, weakening the emphasis of so many
of the silences of which their intimate intercourse would otherwise
have consisted. Beautiful and wonderful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), even, at times, was the
effect of these interventions--their effect above all in bringing home
to each the possible heroism of perfunctory things. They learned fairly
to live in the perfunctory; they remained in it as many hours of the day
as might be; it took on finally the likeness of some spacious central
chamber in a haunted house, a great overarched and overglazed rotunda,
where gaiety might reign, but the doors of which opened into sinister
circular passages. Here they turned up for each other, as they said,
with the blank faces that denied any uneasiness felt in the approach;
here they closed numerous doors carefully behind them--all save the door
that connected the place, as by a straight tented corridor, with the
outer world, and, encouraging thus the irruption of society, imitated
the aperture through which the bedizened performers of the circus are
poured into the ring. The great part Mrs. Verver had socially played
came luckily, Maggie could make out, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) assistance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
<div class="bookquote">``personal friends'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--Charlotte's personal friends had ever been, in
London, at the two houses, one of the most convenient pleasantries--who
actually tempered, at this crisis, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aspect of isolation; and it
wouldn't have been hard to guess that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) best moments were those in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) suffered no fear of becoming a bore to restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) appeal
to their curiosity. Their curiosity might be vague, but their clever
hostess was distinct, and she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) marched them about, sparing them nothing,
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) counted, each day, on a harvest of half crowns. Maggie met
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) again, in the gallery, at the oddest hours, with the party she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
entertaining; heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) draw out the lesson, insist upon the interest,
snub, even, the particular presumption and smile for the general
bewilderment--inevitable features, these latter, of almost any
occasion--in a manner that made our young woman, herself incurably
dazzled, marvel afresh at the mystery by which a creature who could be
in some connexions so earnestly right could be in others so perversely
wrong. When her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father, vaguely circulating, was attended by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife,
it was always Charlotte who seemed to bring up the rear; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hung
in the background when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did cicerone, and it was then perhaps that,
moving mildly and modestly to and fro on the skirts of the exhibition,
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) appearance of weaving his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spell was, for the initiated conscience,
least to be resisted. Brilliant women turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in vague emotion,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) response scarce committed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more than if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been the
person employed to see that, after the invading wave was spent, the
cabinets were all locked and the symmetries all restored.

<p/>There was a morning when, during the hour before luncheon and shortly
after the arrival of a neighbourly contingent--neighbourly from ten
miles off--whom Mrs. Verver had taken in charge, Maggie paused on the
threshold of the gallery through which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been about to pass,
faltered there for the very impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face as it met her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) from an
opposite door. Charlotte, half-way down the vista, held together, as
if by something almost austere in the grace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) authority, the
semi-scared -LRB-now that they were there!-RRB- knot of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) visitors, who, since
they had announced themselves by telegram as yearning to inquire and
admire, saw themselves restricted to this consistency. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) voice, high
and clear and a little hard, reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) step-daughter
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thus placed beyond doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cheerful submission to duty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
words, addressed to the largest publicity, rang for some minutes through
the place, every one as quiet to listen as if it had been a church
ablaze with tapers and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) were taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) part in some hymn of praise.
Fanny Assingham looked rapt in devotion--Fanny Assingham who forsook
this other friend as little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) forsook either her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) host or the
Princess or the Prince or the Principino; she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>), in slow
revolutions, in murmurous attestations of presence, at all such times,
and Maggie, advancing after a first hesitation, was not to fail of
noting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) solemn, inscrutable attitude, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes attentively lifted,
so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might escape being provoked to betray an impression. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
betrayed one, however, as Maggie approached, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) gaze to the
latter's level long enough to seem to adventure, marvellously, on a mute
appeal. <div class="bookquote">``You understand, don't you, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) didn't do this there
would be no knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) might do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>This light Mrs. Assingham richly
launched while her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) younger friend, unresistingly moved, became uncertain
again, and then, not too much to show it--or, rather, positively to
conceal it, and to conceal something more as well--turned short round
to one of the windows and awkwardly, pointlessly waited. <div class="bookquote">``The largest
of the three pieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands, looped
round it, which, as you see, are the finest possible vieux Saxe, are not
of the same origin or period, or even, wonderful as they are, of a taste
quite so perfect. They have been put on at a later time, by a process of
which there are very few examples, and none so important as this, which
is really quite unique--so that, though the whole thing is a little
baroque, its value as a specimen is, I believe, almost inestimable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>neighbours</b></font>)</div><p/>So the high voice quavered, aiming truly at effects far over the heads
of gaping neighbours; so the speaker, piling it up, sticking at nothing,
as less interested judges might have said, seemed to justify the faith
with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was honoured. Maggie meanwhile, at the window, knew the
strangest thing to be happening: she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had turned suddenly to crying,
or was at least on the point of it--the lighted square before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) all
blurred and dim. The high voice went on; its quaver was doubtless for
conscious ears only, but there were verily thirty seconds during which
it sounded, for our young woman, like the shriek of a soul in pain.
Kept up a minute longer it would break and collapse--so that Maggie felt
herself, the next thing, turn with a start to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``Can't she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) be
stopped? Hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) done it ENOUGH?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--some such question as that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
let herself ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to suppose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). Then it was that, across half
the gallery--for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not moved from where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had first seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as confessing, with strange tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own eyes, to sharp
identity of emotion. <div class="bookquote">``Poor thing, poor thing'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--it reached straight--
<div class="bookquote">``ISN'T she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), for one's credit, on the swagger?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>After which, as, held
thus together they had still another strained minute, the shame, the
pity, the better knowledge, the smothered protest, the divined anguish
even, so overcame him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that, blushing to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned short away.
The affair but of a few muffled moments, this snatched communion yet
lifted Maggie as on air--so much, for deep guesses on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own side
too, it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to think of. There was, honestly, an awful mixture in
things, and it was not closed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) aftersense of such passages--we
have already indeed, in other cases, seen it open--that the deepest
depth of all, in a perceived penalty, was that you couldn't be sure
some of your compunctions and contortions wouldn't show for ridiculous.
Amerigo, that morning, for instance, had been as absent as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) at this
juncture appeared to desire he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should mainly be noted as being; he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
had gone to London for the day and the night--a necessity that now
frequently rose for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had more than once suffered to
operate during the presence of guests, successions of pretty women, the
theory of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fond interest in whom had been publicly cultivated. It had
never occurred to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wife to pronounce him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ingenuous, but there came at
last a high dim August dawn when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) couldn't sleep and when, creeping
restlessly about and breathing at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) window the coolness of wooded
acres, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) found the faint flush of the east march with the perception
of that other almost equal prodigy. It rosily coloured her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) vision
that--even such as he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) was, yes--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband could on occasion sin by
excess of candour. He (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) wouldn't otherwise have given as his (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) reason for
going up to Portland Place in the August days that he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) was arranging
books there. He (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) had bought a great many of late, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) had had others,
a large number, sent from Rome--wonders of old print in which her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father
had been interested. But when her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) imagination tracked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to the
dusty town, to the house where drawn blinds and pale shrouds, where a
caretaker and a kitchenmaid were alone in possession, it wasn't to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) shirtsleeves, unpacking battered boxes.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>), in truth, less easily beguiled--saw him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) wander, in the
closed dusky rooms, from place to place, or else, for long periods,
recline on deep sofas and stare before him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) through the smoke of
ceaseless cigarettes. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) out as liking better than anything
in the world just now to be alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) thoughts. Being herself
connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) continued to believe, more than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
ever been, it was thereby a good deal as if he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) were alone with HER. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
made him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) out as resting so from that constant strain of the perfunctory
to which he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) was exposed at Fawns; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was accessible to the
impression of the almost beggared aspect of this alternative. It was
like his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) doing penance in sordid ways--being sent to prison or being
kept without money; it wouldn't have taken much to make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) think of
him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) as really kept without food. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) might have broken away, might easily
have started to travel; he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) had a right--thought wonderful Maggie now--to
so many more freedoms than he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) took! His (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) secret was of course that at
Fawns he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) all the while winced, was all the while in presences in respect
to which he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) had thrown himself back, with a hard pressure, on whatever
mysteries of pride, whatever inward springs familiar to the man of the
world, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could keep from snapping. Maggie, for some reason, had that
morning, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) watched the sunrise, taken an extraordinary measure
of the ground on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have HAD to snatch at pretexts for
absence. It all came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) there--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got off to escape from a sound.
The sound was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own ears still--that of Charlotte's high coerced
quaver before the cabinets in the hushed gallery; the voice by which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) herself had been pierced the day before as by that of a creature in
anguish and by which, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sought refuge at the blurred window, the
tears had been forced into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) comprehension soared so high
that the wonder for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) became really his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not feeling the need of wider
intervals and thicker walls. Before THAT admiration she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) also meditated;
consider as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) kept reading not less into what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
omitted than into what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) performed a beauty of intention that touched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fairly the more by being obscure. It was like hanging over a garden
in the dark; nothing was to be made of the confusion of growing things,
but one felt they were folded flowers, and their vague sweetness made
the whole air their medium. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to turn away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasn't at least
a coward; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would wait on the spot for the issue of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done
on the spot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sank to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knees with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) arm on the ledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
window-seat, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) blinded her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes from the full glare of seeing
that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) idea could only be to wait, whatever might come, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) side.
It was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) buried face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thus, for a long time, felt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) draw
nearest; though after a while, when the strange wail of the gallery
began to repeat its inevitable echo, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was conscious of how that
brought out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pale hard grimace.



<p/>XXXIX

<p/>The resemblance had not been present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) on first coming out into the
hot, still brightness of the Sunday afternoon--only the second Sunday,
of all the summer, when the party of six, the party of seven including
the Principino, had practically been without accessions or invasions;
but within sight of Charlotte, seated far away, very much where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had expected to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), the Princess fell to wondering if her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) friend
wouldn't be affected quite as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) herself had been, that night on the
terrace, under Mrs. Verver's perceptive pursuit. The relation, to-day,
had turned itself round; Charlotte was seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) come, through patches
of lingering noon, quite as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had watched Charlotte menace her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) through
the starless dark; and there was a moment, that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) waiting a little
as they thus met across the distance, when the interval was bridged by
a recognition not less soundless, and to all appearance not less charged
with strange meanings, than that of the other occasion. The point,
however, was that they had changed places; Maggie had from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) window,
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stepmother leave the house--at so unlikely an hour, three
o’clock of a canicular August, for a ramble in garden or grove--and had
thereupon felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) impulse determined with the same sharpness that
had made the spring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion's three weeks before. It was the
hottest day of the season, and the shaded siesta, for people all at
their ease, would certainly rather have been prescribed; but our young
woman had perhaps not yet felt it so fully brought home that such
refinements of repose, among them, constituted the empty chair at the
feast. This was the more distinct as the feast, literally, in the great
bedimmed dining-room, the cool, ceremonious semblance of luncheon, had
just been taking place without Mrs. Verver. She (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had been represented but
by the plea of a bad headache, not reported to the rest of the company
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) husband, but offered directly to Mr. Verver himself, on their
having assembled, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) maid, deputed for the effect and solemnly
producing it.

<p/>Maggie had sat down, with the others, to viands artfully iced, to
the slow circulation of precious tinkling jugs, to marked reserves
of reference in many directions--poor Fanny Assingham herself scarce
thrusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) nose out of the padded hollow into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had
withdrawn. A consensus of languor, which might almost have been taken
for a community of dread, ruled the scene--relieved only by the fitful
experiments of Father Mitchell, good holy, hungry man, a trusted and
overworked London friend and adviser, who had taken, for a week or two,
the light neighbouring service, local rites flourishing under Maggie's
munificence, and was enjoying, as a convenience, all the bounties of the
house. HE (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) conversed undiscouraged, Father Mitchell--conversed mainly
with the indefinite, wandering smile of the entertainers, and the
Princess's power to feel him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>) on the whole a blessing for these occasions
was not impaired by what was awkward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) consciousness of having,
from the first of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) trouble, really found her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) way without his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>)
guidance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) asked herself at times if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>) suspected how more than
subtly, how perversely, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had dispensed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) balanced
between visions of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>) must privately have guessed and certitudes
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>) had guessed nothing whatever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>) might nevertheless have been
so urbanely filling up gaps, at present, for the very reason that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>)
instinct, sharper than the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>) face, had sufficiently
served him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>)--made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>) aware of the thin ice, figuratively speaking, and
of prolongations of tension, round about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>), mostly foreign to the
circles in which luxury was akin to virtue. Some day in some happier
season, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would confess to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitchell</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hadn't confessed, though
taking so much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) conscience; but just now she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was carrying in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
weak, stiffened hand a glass filled to the brim, as to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had
recorded a vow that no drop should overflow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) feared the very breath
of a better wisdom, the jostle of the higher light, of heavenly help
itself; and, in addition, however that might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) drew breath this
afternoon, as never yet, in an element heavy to oppression. Something
grave had happened, somehow and somewhere, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had, God knew, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
choice of suppositions: her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) heart stood still when she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wondered above
all if the cord mightn't at last have snapped between her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) husband and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) eyes for dismay at the possibility of such a
passage--there moved before them the procession of ugly forms it might
have taken. <div class="bookquote">``Find out for yourself!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had thrown to Amerigo, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) last word, on the question of who else <div class="bookquote">``knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div>that night of the
breaking of the Bowl; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) flattered herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hadn't since
then helped him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) clear consistency, by an inch. It was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
had given him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), all these weeks, to be busy with, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had again and
again lain awake for the obsession of this sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uncertainty
ruthlessly and endlessly playing with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dignity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had handed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
over to an ignorance that couldn't even try to become indifferent
and that yet wouldn't project itself, either, into the cleared air of
conviction. In proportion as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was generous it had bitten into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
spirit, and more than once she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had said to herself that to break the
spell she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had cast upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and that the polished old ivory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
father's inattackable surface made so absolute, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would suddenly commit
some mistake or some violence, smash some windowpane for air, fail even
of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blest inveteracies of taste. In that way, fatally, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would have put himself in the wrong--blighting by a single false step
the perfection of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) outward show.

<p/>These shadows rose and fell for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) while Father Mitchell prattled; with
other shadows as well, those that hung over Charlotte herself,
those that marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as a prey to equal suspicions--to the idea, in
particular, of a change, such a change as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't dare to face, in
the relations of the two men. Or there were yet other possibilities, as
it seemed to Maggie; there were always too many, and all of them things
of evil when one's nerves had at last done for one all that nerves could
do; had left one in a darkness of prowling dangers that was like the
predicament of the night-watcher in a beast-haunted land who has no
more means for a fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might, with such nerves, have supposed almost
anything of any one; anything, almost, of poor Bob Assingham, condemned
to eternal observances and solemnly appreciating her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's wine;
anything, verily, yes, of the good priest, as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) finally sat back with
fat folded hands and twiddled his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) thumbs on his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) stomach. The good priest
looked hard at the decanters, at the different dishes of dessert--he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
eyed them, half-obliquely, as if THEY might have met him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) to-day, for
conversation, better than any one present. But the Princess had her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
fancy at last about that too; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was in the midst of a passage, before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) knew it, between Father Mitchell and Charlotte--some approach
he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) would have attempted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), that very morning perhaps, to the
circumstance of an apparent detachment, recently noted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), from any
practice of devotion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) would have drawn from this, say, his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) artless
inference--taken it for a sign of some smothered inward trouble and
pointed, naturally, the moral that the way out of such straits was
not through neglect of the grand remedy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had possibly prescribed
contrition--he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had at any rate quickened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) the beat of that false
repose to which our young woman's own act had devoted her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) all so
deluded instance. The falsity of it had laid traps compared to which the
imputation of treachery even accepted might have seemed a path of roses.
The acceptance, strangely, would have left her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) nothing to do--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
could have remained, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) liked, all insolently passive; whereas the
failure to proceed against her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), as it might have been called, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
everything, and all the more that it was wrapped so in confidence.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had to confirm, day after day, the rightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cause and the
justice and felicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) exemption--so that wouldn't there have
been, fairly, in any explicit concern of Father Mitchell's, depths of
practical derision of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) success?

<p/>The question was provisionally answered, at all events, by the time the
party at luncheon had begun to disperse--with Maggie's version of Mrs.
Verver sharp to the point of representing her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) pretext for absence as
a positive flight from derision. She (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) met the good priest's eyes before
they separated, and priests were really, at the worst, so to speak, such
wonderful people that she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) for an instant on the verge of
saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), in abysmal softness: <div class="bookquote">``Go to Mrs. Verver, my child--YOU
go: you'll find that you can help her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>This didn't come, however;
nothing came but the renewed twiddle of thumbs over the satisfied
stomach and the full flush, the comical candour, of reference to the
hand employed at Fawns for mayonnaise of salmon. Nothing came but
the receding backs of each of the others--her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) father's slightly bent
shoulders, in especial, which seemed to weave his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spell, by the force of
habit, not less patiently than if his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife had been present. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband
indeed was present to feel anything there might be to feel--which was
perhaps exactly why this personage was moved promptly to emulate so
definite an example of <div class="bookquote">``sloping.''  (<font color='red'><b>this personage</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) occupations--books to
arrange perhaps even at Fawns; the idea of the siesta, moreover, in all
the conditions, had no need to be loudly invoked. Maggie, was, in the
event, left alone for a minute with Mrs. Assingham, who, after waiting
for safety, appeared to have at heart to make a demonstration. The stage
of <div class="bookquote">``talking over''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>had long passed for them; when they communicated now
it was on quite ultimate facts; but Fanny desired to testify to the
existence, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) part, of an attention that nothing escaped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
like the kind lady who, happening to linger at the circus while the
rest of the spectators pour grossly through the exits, falls in with the
overworked little trapezist girl--the acrobatic support presumably
of embarrassed and exacting parents--and gives her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as an obscure and
meritorious artist, assurance of benevolent interest. What was clearest,
always, in our young woman's imaginings, was the sense of being herself
left, for any occasion, in the breach. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was essentially there to bear
the burden, in the last resort, of surrounding omissions and evasions,
and it was eminently to that office she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been to-day abandoned--with
this one alleviation, as appeared, of Mrs. Assingham's keeping up
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>). Mrs. Assingham suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) too was still on the
ramparts--though her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) gallantry proved indeed after a moment to consist
not a little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) curiosity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had looked about and seen their
companions beyond earshot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you really want us to go--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie found a faint smile. <div class="bookquote">``Do you really want to--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend colour. <div class="bookquote">``Well then--no. But we WOULD, you know, at a
look from you. We'd pack up and be off--as a sacrifice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, make no sacrifice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``See me through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it--that's all I want. I should be too base--! Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny
went on, <div class="bookquote">``you're too splendid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Splendid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Splendid. Also, you know, you ARE all but `through.' You've done it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Assingham. But Maggie only half took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it strike you that I've done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What you wanted. They're going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie continued to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Is that what I wanted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it wasn't for you to say. That was his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father's?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie asked after an hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father's. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has chosen--and now she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knows. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sees it all before
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) can't speak, or resist, or move a little finger. That's
what's the matter with HER,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham.

<p/>It made a picture, somehow, for the Princess, as they stood there--the
picture that the words of others, whatever they might be, always made
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), even when her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) vision was already charged, better than any
words of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) saw, round about her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), through the chinks of the
shutters, the hard glare of nature--saw Charlotte, somewhere in it,
virtually at bay, and yet denied the last grace of any protecting truth.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) off somewhere all unaided, pale in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) silence and taking in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fate. <div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) told you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) then asked.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion smiled superior. <div class="bookquote">``_I_ don't need to be told--either! I
see something, thank God, every day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>And then as Maggie might appear to
be wondering what, for instance: <div class="bookquote">``I see the long miles of ocean and the
dreadful great country, State after State--which have never seemed to me
so big or so terrible. I see THEM at last, day by day and step by step,
at the far end--and I see them never come back. But NEVER--simply. I
see the extraordinary `interesting' place--which I've never been to, you
know, and you have--and the exact degree in which she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will be expected
to be interested.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) WILL be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie presently replied. <div class="bookquote">``Expected?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Interested.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For a little, after this, their eyes met on it; at the end of which
Fanny said: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll be--yes--what she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll HAVE to be. And it will
be--won't it? for ever and ever.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke as abounding in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) friend's
sense, but it made Maggie still only look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/>These were large words and large visions--all the more that now, really,
they spread and spread. In the midst of them, however, Mrs. Assingham
had soon enough continued. <div class="bookquote">``When I talk of `knowing,' indeed, I don't
mean it as you would have a right to do. You know because you see--and I
don't see HIM. I don't make him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) almost crudely confessed.

<p/>Maggie again hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``You mean you don't make out Amerigo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>But Fanny shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head, and it was quite as if, as an appeal to one's
intelligence, the making out of Amerigo had, in spite of everything,
long been superseded. Then Maggie measured the reach of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) allusion,
and how what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) next said gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) meaning a richness. No other name
was to be spoken, and Mrs. Assingham had taken that, without delay, from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) eyes--with a discretion, still, that fell short but by an inch. <div class="bookquote">``You
know how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie at this then slowly matched her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) headshake. <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know how YOU feel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But again she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) denied it. <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing. If I did--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you did?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny asked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) faltered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had had enough, however. <div class="bookquote">``I should die,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) turned
away.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) room, through the quiet house; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) roamed there a
moment, picking up, pointlessly, a different fan, and then took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) way
to the shaded apartments in which, at this hour, the Principino would
be enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) nap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) passed through the first empty room, the day
nursery, and paused at an open door. The inner room, large, dim and
cool, was equally calm; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) boy's ample, antique, historical, royal
crib, consecrated, reputedly, by the guarded rest of heirs-apparent, and
a gift, early in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) career, from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grandfather, ruled the scene from
the centre, in the stillness of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could almost hear the child's
soft breathing. The prime protector of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dreams was installed beside
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father sat there with as little motion--with head thrown back
and supported, with eyes apparently closed, with the fine foot that
was so apt to betray nervousness at peace upon the other knee, with
the unfathomable heart folded in the constant flawless freshness of
the white waistcoat that could always receive in its armholes the firm
prehensile thumbs. Mrs. Noble had majestically melted, and the whole
place signed her (<font color='blue'><b>Noble</b></font>) temporary abdication; yet the actual situation was
regular, and Maggie lingered but to look. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fan, the
top of which was pressed against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face, long enough to wonder if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
father really slept or if, aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only kept consciously quiet.
Did his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes truly fix her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) between lids partly open, and was she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to
take this--his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) forebearance from any question--only as a sign again that
everything was left to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at all events, for a minute, watched
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) immobility--then, as if once more renewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) total submission,
returned, without a sound, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own quarters.

<p/>A strange impulse was sharp in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), but it was not, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) part, the
desire to shift the weight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could as little have slept as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could
have slept that morning, days before, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had watched the first
dawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) window. Turned to the east, this side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) room was now
in shade, with the two wings of the casement folded back and the charm
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) always found in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seemingly perched position--as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) outlook,
from above the high terraces, was that of some castle-tower mounted on
a rock. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood there she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hung over, over the gardens and the
woods--all of which drowsed below her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), at this hour, in the immensity of
light. The miles of shade looked hot, the banks of flowers looked
dim; the peacocks on the balustrades let their tails hang limp and the
smaller birds lurked among the leaves. Nothing therefore would have
appeared to stir in the brilliant void if Maggie, at the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
about to turn away, had not caught sight of a moving spot, a clear green
sunshade in the act of descending a flight of steps. It passed down
from the terrace, receding, at a distance, from sight, and carried,
naturally, so as to conceal the head and back of its bearer; but Maggie
had quickly recognised the white dress and the particular motion of this
adventurer--had taken in that Charlotte, of all people, had chosen the
glare of noon for an exploration of the gardens, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could be
betaking herself only to some unvisited quarter deep in them, or beyond
them, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had already marked as a superior refuge. The Princess
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) for a few minutes in sight, watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) long enough to feel
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), by the mere betrayal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) pace and direction, driven in a kind of
flight, and then understood, for herself, why the act of sitting still
had become impossible to either of them. There came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), confusedly,
some echo of an ancient fable--some vision of Io goaded by the gadfly or
of Ariadne roaming the lone sea-strand. It brought with it all the sense
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) own intention and desire; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) too might have been, for the hour,
some far-off harassed heroine--only with a part to play for which
she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) knew, exactly, no inspiring precedent. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) knew but that, all the
while--all the while of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) sitting there among the others without
her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) had wanted to go straight to this detached member of the party
and make somehow, for her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) support, the last demonstration. A pretext was
all that was needful, and Maggie after another instant had found
one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had caught a glimpse, before Mrs. Verver disappeared, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
carrying a book--made out, half lost in the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) white dress,
the dark cover of a volume that was to explain her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) purpose in case of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) being met with surprise, and the mate of which, precisely, now lay
on Maggie's table. The book was an old novel that the Princess had a
couple of days before mentioned having brought down from Portland
Place in the charming original form of its three volumes. Charlotte had
hailed, with a specious glitter of interest, the opportunity to read it,
and our young woman had, thereupon, on the morrow, directed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) maid to
carry it to Mrs. Verver's apartments. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was afterwards to observe that
this messenger, unintelligent or inadvertent, had removed but one of
the volumes, which happened not to be the first. Still possessed,
accordingly, of the first while Charlotte, going out, fantastically, at
such an hour, to cultivate romance in an arbour, was helplessly armed
with the second, Maggie prepared on the spot to sally forth with
succour. The right volume, with a parasol, was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) required--in
addition, that is, to the bravery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) general idea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) passed again
through the house, unchallenged, and emerged upon the terrace, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) followed, hugging the shade, with that consciousness of turning
the tables on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend which we have already noted. But so far as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went, after descending into the open and beginning to explore the
grounds, Mrs. Verver had gone still further--with the increase of the
oddity, moreover, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) having exchanged the protection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) room for
these exposed and shining spaces. It was not, fortunately, however,
at last, that by persisting in pursuit one didn't arrive at regions
of admirable shade: this was the asylum, presumably, that the poor
wandering woman had had in view--several wide alleys, in particular,
of great length, densely overarched with the climbing rose and the
honeysuckle and converging, in separate green vistas, at a sort of
umbrageous temple, an ancient rotunda, pillared and statued, niched and
roofed, yet with its uncorrected antiquity, like that of everything
else at Fawns, conscious hitherto of no violence from the present and
no menace from the future. Charlotte had paused there, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) frenzy, or
what ever it was to be called; the place was a conceivable retreat, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was staring before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), from the seat to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) appeared to have
sunk, all unwittingly, as Maggie stopped at the beginning of one of the
perspectives.

<p/>It was a repetition more than ever then of the evening on the terrace;
the distance was too great to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been immediately seen,
but the Princess waited, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) intention, as Charlotte on the other
occasion had waited--allowing, oh allowing, for the difference of the
intention! Maggie was full of the sense of THAT--so full that it made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) impatient; whereupon she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) moved forward a little, placing herself in
range of the eyes that had been looking off elsewhere, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
suddenly called to recognition. Charlotte had evidently not dreamed of
being followed, and instinctively, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pale stare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stiffened
herself for protest. Maggie could make that out--as well as, further,
however, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) second impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend's approach had an
instant effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) attitude. The Princess came nearer, gravely and
in silence, but fairly paused again, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) time for whatever
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would. Whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would, whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) could, was what Maggie
wanted--wanting above all to make it as easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as the case
permitted. That was not what Charlotte had wanted the other night, but
this never mattered--the great thing was to allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), was fairly to
produce in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), the sense of highly choosing. At first, clearly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
been frightened; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had not been pursued, it had quickly struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>),
without some design on the part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pursuer, and what might she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
not be thinking of in addition but the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had, when herself the
pursuer, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stepdaughter take in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spirit and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) purpose? It
had sunk into Maggie at the time, that hard insistence, and Mrs. Verver
had felt it and seen it and heard it sink; which wonderful remembrance
of pressure successfully applied had naturally, till now, remained with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>). But her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) stare was like a projected fear that the buried treasure,
so dishonestly come by, for which her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) companion's still countenance, at
the hour and afterwards, had consented to serve as the deep soil, might
have worked up again to the surface, to be thrown back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) hands.
Yes, it was positive that during one of these minutes the Princess had
the vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) particular alarm. <div class="bookquote">``It's her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lie, it's her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lie that has
mortally disagreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can keep down no longer her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rebellion
at it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has come to retract it, to disown it and denounce it--to
give me full in my face the truth instead.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>This, for a concentrated
instant, Maggie felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) helplessly gasp--but only to let it bring home
the indignity, the pity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) state. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) herself could but tentatively
hover, place in view the book she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) carried, look as little dangerous,
look as abjectly mild, as possible; remind herself really of people she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had read about in stories of the wild west, people who threw up their
hands, on certain occasions, as a sign they weren't carrying revolvers.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could almost have smiled at last, troubled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) yet knew herself,
to show how richly she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was harmless; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) volume, which was
so weak a weapon, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) continued, for consideration, to keep
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) distance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) explained with as quenched a quaver as possible. <div class="bookquote">``I
saw you come out--saw you from my window, and couldn't bear to think you
should find yourself here without the beginning of your book. THIS is
the beginning; you've got the wrong volume, and I've brought you out the
right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) remained after she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had spoken; it was like holding a parley with a
possible adversary, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) intense, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) exalted little smile asked for
formal leave. <div class="bookquote">``May I come nearer now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) seemed to say--as to which,
however, the next minute, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) saw Charlotte's reply lose itself in a
strange process, a thing of several sharp stages, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could stand
there and trace. The dread, after a minute, had dropped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face;
though, discernibly enough, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) still couldn't believe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) having, in
so strange a fashion, been deliberately made up to. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been made
up to, at least, it was with an idea--the idea that had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) at
first as necessarily dangerous. That it wasn't, insistently wasn't, this
shone from Maggie with a force finally not to be resisted; and on that
perception, on the immense relief so constituted, everything had by the
end of three minutes extraordinarily changed. Maggie had come out to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), really, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doomed, doomed to a separation
that was like a knife in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heart; and in the very sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
uncontrollable, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) blinded physical quest of a peace not to be grasped,
something of Mrs. Assingham's picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) as thrown, for a grim
future, beyond the great sea and the great continent had at first found
fulfilment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had got away, in this fashion--burning behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>),
almost, the ships of disguise--to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) horror of what was before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) play up without witnesses; and even after Maggie's approach had
presented an innocent front it was still not to be mistaken that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
bristled with the signs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) extremity. It was not to be said for
them, either, that they were draped at this hour in any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) usual
graces; unveiled and all but unashamed, they were tragic to the Princess
in spite of the dissimulation that, with the return of comparative
confidence, was so promptly to operate. How tragic, in essence, the very
change made vivid, the instant stiffening of the spring of pride--this
for possible defence if not for possible aggression. Pride indeed,
the next moment, had become the mantle caught up for protection and
perversity; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) flung it round her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) as a denial of any loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
freedom. To be doomed was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) situation, to have extravagantly
incurred a doom, so that to confess to wretchedness was, by the same
stroke, to confess to falsity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wouldn't confess, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) didn't--a
thousand times no; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) only cast about her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and quite frankly and
fiercely, for something else that would give colour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) having burst
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) bonds. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) eyes expanded, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) bosom heaved as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) invoked it, and
the effect upon Maggie was verily to wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could only help her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) presently got up--which seemed to mean <div class="bookquote">``Oh, stay if you like!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had moved about awhile at random, looking away, looking at
anything, at everything but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) visitor; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had spoken of the
temperature and declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) revelled in it; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had uttered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thanks for the book, which, a little incoherently, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) second
volume, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) perhaps found less clever than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) expected; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had
let Maggie approach sufficiently closer to lay, untouched, the tribute
in question on a bench and take up obligingly its superfluous mate: when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done these things she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sat down in another place, more or less
visibly in possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) part. Our young woman was to have passed,
in all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) adventure, no stranger moments; for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not only now saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
companion fairly agree to take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) then for the poor little person she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was finding it so easy to appear, but fell, in a secret, responsive
ecstasy, to wondering if there were not some supreme abjection with
which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might be inspired. Vague, but increasingly brighter, this
possibility glimmered on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). It at last hung there adequately plain
to Charlotte that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had presented herself once more to -LRB-as they said-RRB-
grovel; and that, truly, made the stage large. It had absolutely, within
the time, taken on the dazzling merit of being large for each of them
alike.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to see you alone--there's something I've been wanting to say
to you. I'm tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Verver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Verver, <div class="bookquote">``I'm tired--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tired--?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It had dropped the next thing; it couldn't all come at once;
but Maggie had already guessed what it was, and the flush of recognition
was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tired of this life--the one we've been leading. You like it, I know,
but I've dreamed another dream.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head now; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lighted
eyes more triumphantly rested; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was finding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was following
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) way. Maggie, by the same influence, sat in sight of it; there was
something she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was SAVING, some quantity of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) herself was judge;
and it was for a long moment, even with the sacrifice the Princess
had come to make, a good deal like watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), from the solid
shore, plunge into uncertain, into possibly treacherous depths. <div class="bookquote">``I see
something else,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``I've an idea that greatly appeals to
me--I've had it for a long time. It has come over me that we're wrong.
Our real life isn't here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie held her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) breath. ```Ours'--?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband's and mine. I'm not speaking for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, only praying not to be, not even to appear, stupid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm speaking for ourselves. I'm speaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte brought out, <div class="bookquote">``for
HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. For my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For your father. For whom else?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>They looked at each other hard now,
but Maggie's face took refuge in the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) interest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
was not at all even so stupid as to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion's question as
requiring an answer; a discretion that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) controlled stillness had
after an instant justified. <div class="bookquote">``I must risk your thinking me selfish--for
of course you know what it involves. Let me admit it--I AM selfish. I
place my husband first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie smiling and smiling, <div class="bookquote">``since that's where I place
mine--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean you'll have no quarrel with me? So much the better then;
for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte went on with a higher and higher flight, <div class="bookquote">``my plan is
completely formed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie waited--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) glimmer had deepened; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) chance somehow was at hand.
The only danger was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoiling it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt herself skirting an abyss.
<div class="bookquote">``What then, may I ask IS your plan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It hung fire but ten seconds; it came out sharp. <div class="bookquote">``To take him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) home--to
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) real position. And not to wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean--a--this season?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean immediately. And--I may as well tell you now--I mean for my own
time. I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>Charlotte said, <div class="bookquote">``to have him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at last a little to myself;
I want, strange as it may seem to you'' (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Stant/Charlotte/Stant</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave it all its weight
<div class="bookquote">``to KEEP the man I've married. And to do so, I see, I must act.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie, with the effort still to follow the right line, felt herself
colour to the eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Immediately?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thoughtfully echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as we can get off. The removal of everything is, after all,
but a detail. That can always be done; with money, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spends it,
everything can. What I ask for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte declared, <div class="bookquote">``is the definite
break. And I wish it now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>With which her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) head, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) voice rose
higher. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I know my difficulty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Far down below the level of attention, in she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could scarce have said
what sacred depths, Maggie's inspiration had come, and it had trembled
the next moment into sound. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean I'M your difficulty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) together--since it's always with you that I've had to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But it's a difficulty that I'm facing, if you wish to know; that
I've already faced; that I propose to myself to surmount. The struggle
with it--none too pleasant--hasn't been for me, as you may imagine, in
itself charming; I've felt in it at times, if I must tell you all, too
great and too strange, an ugliness. Yet I believe it may succeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had risen, with this, Mrs. Verver, and had moved, for the emphasis
of it, a few steps away; while Maggie, motionless at first, but sat and
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You want to take my father FROM me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>The sharp, successful, almost primitive wail in it made Charlotte turn,
and this movement attested for the Princess the felicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) deceit.
Something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) throbbed as it had throbbed the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) stood in
the drawing-room and denied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had suffered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was ready to lie
again if her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) companion would but give her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) the opening. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) should
know she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had done all. Charlotte looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hard, as if to compare
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) note of resentment; and Maggie, feeling this, met it
with the signs of an impression that might pass for the impression of
defeat. <div class="bookquote">``I want really to possess him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Verver</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Verver. <div class="bookquote">``I happen also
to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s worth it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie rose as if to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh--worth it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wonderfully threw
off.

<p/>The tone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) instantly saw, again had its effect: Charlotte flamed
aloft--might truly have been believing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) passionate parade. <div class="bookquote">``You've
thought YOU'VE known what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s worth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed then, my dear, I believe I have--as I believe I still do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had given it, Maggie, straight back, and again it had not missed.
Charlotte, for another moment, only looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); then broke into the
words--Maggie had known they would come--of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had pressed the
spring. <div class="bookquote">``How I see that you loathed our marriage!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you ASK me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie after an instant demanded.

<p/>Charlotte had looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), picked up the parasol she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had laid on
a bench, possessed herself mechanically of one of the volumes of the
relegated novel and then, more consciously, flung it down again: she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
in presence, visibly, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) last word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sunshade with
a click; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) twirled it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shoulder in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pride. ```Ask' you? Do I
need? How I see,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) broke out, <div class="bookquote">``that you've worked against me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh, oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess exclaimed.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) companion, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), had reached one of the archways, but on this
turned round with a flare. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't worked against me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie took it and for a moment kept it; held it, with closed eyes, as
if it had been some captured fluttering bird pressed by both hands to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) breast. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes to speak. <div class="bookquote">``What does it matter--if
I've failed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You recognise then that you've failed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>asked Charlotte from the
threshold.

<p/>Maggie waited; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion had done a moment before,
at the two books on the seat; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put them together and laid them
down; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``I've failed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sounded out before
Charlotte, having given her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) time, walked away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), splendid
and erect, float down the long vista; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sank upon a seat. Yes,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had done all.




<p/>PART SIXTH.

<p/>XL

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do anything you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband on one of the last
days of the month, <div class="bookquote">``if our being here, this way at this time, seems to
you too absurd, or too uncomfortable, or too impossible. We'll either
take leave of them now, without waiting--or we'll come back in time,
three days before they start. I'll go abroad with you, if you but say
the word; to Switzerland, the Tyrol, the Italian Alps, to whichever of
your old high places you would like most to see again--those beautiful
ones that used to do you good after Rome and that you so often told me
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Where they were, in the conditions that prompted this offer, and where
it might indeed appear ridiculous that, with the stale London September
close at hand, they should content themselves with remaining, was where
the desert of Portland Place looked blank as it had never looked, and
where a drowsy cabman, scanning the horizon for a fare, could sink to
oblivion of the risks of immobility. But Amerigo was of the odd opinion,
day after day, that their situation couldn't be bettered; and he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) even
went at no moment through the form of replying that, should their ordeal
strike her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) as exceeding their patience, any step they might take would
be for her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) own relief. This was, no doubt, partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) stood out
so wonderfully, to the end, against admitting, by a weak word at least,
that any element of their existence WAS, or ever had been, an ordeal; no
trap of circumstance, no lapse of <div class="bookquote">``form,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>no accident of irritation, had
landed him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) in that inconsequence. His (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wife might verily have suggested
that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was consequent--consequent with the admirable appearance he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had
from the first so undertaken, and so continued, to present--rather too
rigidly at HER expense; only, as it happened, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not the little
person to do anything of the sort, and the strange tacit compact
actually in operation between them might have been founded on an
intelligent comparison, a definite collation positively, of the kinds of
patience proper to each. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) through--he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had engaged
to come out at the right end if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) WOULD see him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>): this understanding,
tacitly renewed from week to week, had fairly received, with the
procession of the weeks, the consecration of time; but it scarce needed
to be insisted on that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) on HIS (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) terms, not all on
hers, or that, in other words, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must allow him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) unexplained and
uncharted, his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) one practicably workable way. If that way, by one of the
intimate felicities the liability to which was so far from having even
yet completely fallen from him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), happened handsomely to show him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) as more
bored than boring -LRB-with advantages of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own freely to surrender, but
none to be persuadedly indebted to others for,-RRB- what did such a false
face of the matter represent but the fact itself that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was pledged?
If she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had questioned or challenged or interfered--if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had reserved
herself that right--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wouldn't have been pledged; whereas there were
still, and evidently would be yet a while, long, tense stretches
during which their case might have been hanging, for every eye, on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
possible, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) impossible defection. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must keep it up to the last,
mustn't absent herself for three minutes from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) post: only on those
lines, assuredly, would she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) show herself as with him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and not against
him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>It was extraordinary how scant a series of signs she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had invited him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to
make of being, of truly having been at any time, <div class="bookquote">``with''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wife: that
reflection she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not exempt from as they now, in their suspense,
supremely waited--a reflection under the brush of which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) recognised
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) having had, in respect to him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as well, to <div class="bookquote">``do all,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to go the whole
way over, to move, indefatigably, while he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stood as fixed in his (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) place
as some statue of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) forefathers. The meaning of it would seem
to be, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reasoned in sequestered hours, that he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) HAD a place, and that
this was an attribute somehow indefeasible, unquenchable, which laid
upon others--from the moment they definitely wanted anything of him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--
the necessity of taking more of the steps that he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could, of circling
round him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), of remembering for his (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) benefit the famous relation of the
mountain to Mahomet. It was strange, if one had gone into it, but such
a place as Amerigo's was like something made for him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beforehand by
innumerable facts, facts largely of the sort known as historical, made
by ancestors, examples, traditions, habits; while Maggie's own had come
to show simply as that improvised <div class="bookquote">``post'' (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>--a post of the kind spoken of
as advanced--with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was to have found herself connected in the
fashion of a settler or a trader in a new country; in the likeness even
of some Indian squaw with a papoose on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) back and barbarous bead-work
to sell. Maggie's own, in short, would have been sought in vain in the
most rudimentary map of the social relations as such. The only geography
marking it would be doubtless that of the fundamental passions. The
<div class="bookquote">``end''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>that the Prince was at all events holding out for was represented
to expectation by his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) father-in-law's announced departure for America
with Mrs. Verver; just as that prospective event had originally figured
as advising, for discretion, the flight of the younger couple, to say
nothing of the withdrawal of whatever other importunate company, before
the great upheaval of Fawns. This residence was to be peopled for a
month by porters, packers and hammerers, at whose operations it had
become peculiarly public--public that is for Portland Place--that
Charlotte was to preside in force; operations the quite awful appointed
scale and style of which had at no moment loomed so large to Maggie's
mind as one day when the dear Assinghams swam back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ken
besprinkled with sawdust and looking as pale as if they had seen Samson
pull down the temple. They had seen at least what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was not seeing,
rich dim things under the impression of which they had retired; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
having eyes at present but for the clock by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) timed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband,
or for the glass--the image perhaps would be truer--in which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
reflected to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as HE (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) timed the pair in the country. The accession of
their friends from Cadogan Place contributed to all their intermissions,
at any rate, a certain effect of resonance; an effect especially marked
by the upshot of a prompt exchange of inquiries between Mrs. Assingham
and the Princess. It was noted, on the occasion of that anxious lady's
last approach to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) young friend at Fawns, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sympathy had
ventured, after much accepted privation, again to become inquisitive,
and it had perhaps never so yielded to that need as on this question of
the present odd <div class="bookquote">``line''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>of the distinguished eccentrics.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to say really that you're going to stick here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>And then
before Maggie could answer: <div class="bookquote">``What on earth will you do with your
evenings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie waited a moment--Maggie could still tentatively smile. <div class="bookquote">``When
people learn we're here--and of course the papers will be full of
it!--they'll flock back in their hundreds, from wherever they are, to
catch us. You see you and the Colonel have yourselves done it. As for
our evenings, they won't, I dare say, be particularly different from
anything else that's ours. They won't be different from our mornings or
our afternoons--except perhaps that you two dears will sometimes help us
to get through them. I've offered to go anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) added; <div class="bookquote">``to take
a house if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will. But THIS--just this and nothing else--is Amerigo's
idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) gave it yesterday''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``a name that, as, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said,
described and fitted it. So you see'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and the Princess indulged again
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) smile that didn't play, but that only, as might have been said,
worked--<div class="bookquote">``so you see there's a method in our madness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>It drew Mrs. Assingham's wonder. <div class="bookquote">``And what then is the name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>```The reduction to its simplest expression of what we ARE doing'--that's
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) called it. Therefore as we're doing nothing, we're doing it in
the most aggravated way--which is the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) desires.'' With which Maggie
further said: <div class="bookquote">``Of course I understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I!''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) visitor after a moment breathed. <div class="bookquote">``You've had to vacate
the house--that was inevitable. But at least here he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) doesn't funk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Our young woman accepted the expression. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) doesn't funk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>It only, however, half contented Fanny, who thoughtfully raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)'s prodigious; but what is there--as you've `fixed' it--TO
dodge? Unless,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``it's her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) getting near him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); it's--if you'll
pardon my vulgarity--her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) getting AT him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). That,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) suggested, <div class="bookquote">``may
count with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But it found the Princess prepared. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) can get near him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) here. She (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) can
get `at' him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) can come up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``CAN she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny Assingham questioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``CAN'T she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie returned.

<p/>Their eyes, for a minute, intimately met on it; after which the elder
woman said: <div class="bookquote">``I mean for seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess.

<p/>At which Fanny, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reasons, couldn't help smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if it's for
THAT he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)'s staying--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)'s staying--I've made it out--to take anything that comes or calls
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). To take,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie went on, <div class="bookquote">``even that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) put it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had at last put it to herself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)'s staying for high decency.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Decency?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham gravely echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Decency. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) SHOULD try--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham urged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)'ll see her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie hesitated, however; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) made no direct reply. <div class="bookquote">``It's useless
hoping,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) presently said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) won't. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) ought to.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend's
expression of a moment before, which had been apologised for as vulgar,
prolonged its sharpness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) ear--that of an electric bell under
continued pressure. Stated so simply, what was it but dreadful, truly,
that the feasibility of Charlotte's <div class="bookquote">``getting at''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>the man who for so
long had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should now be in question? Strangest of all things,
doubtless, this care of Maggie's as to what might make for it or make
against it; stranger still her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) fairly lapsing at moments into a vague
calculation of the conceivability, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own part, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband,
of some direct sounding of the subject. Would it be too monstrous, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
suddenly breaking out to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as in alarm at the lapse of the weeks:
<div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't it really seem that you're bound in honour to do something for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), privately, before they go?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Maggie was capable of weighing the
risk of this adventure for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own spirit, capable of sinking to intense
little absences, even while conversing, as now, with the person who had
most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) confidence, during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) followed up the possibilities.
It was true that Mrs. Assingham could at such times somewhat restore
the balance--by not wholly failing to guess her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) thought. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) thought,
however, just at present, had more than one face--had a series that it
successively presented. These were indeed the possibilities involved in
the adventure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) concerning herself for the quantity of compensation
that Mrs. Verver might still look to. There was always the possibility
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) WAS, after all, sufficiently to get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)--there was in fact
that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) having again and again done so. Against this stood
nothing but Fanny Assingham's apparent belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) privation--more
mercilessly imposed, or more hopelessly felt, in the actual relation
of the parties; over and beyond everything that, from more than three
months back, of course, had fostered in the Princess a like conviction.
These assumptions might certainly be baseless--inasmuch as there were
hours and hours of Amerigo's time that there was no habit, no pretence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) accounting for; inasmuch too as Charlotte, inevitably, had had
more than once, to the undisguised knowledge of the pair in Portland
Place, been obliged to come up to Eaton Square, whence so many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
personal possessions were in course of removal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't come to
Portland Place--didn't even come to ask for luncheon on two separate
occasions when it reached the consciousness of the household there
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was spending the day in London. Maggie hated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) scorned, to
compare hours and appearances, to weigh the idea of whether there
hadn't been moments, during these days, when an assignation, in easy
conditions, a snatched interview, in an air the season had so cleared
of prying eyes, mightn't perfectly work. But the very reason of this was
partly that, haunted with the vision of the poor woman carrying off
with such bravery as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand the secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not being
appeased, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was conscious of scant room for any alternative image.
The alternative image would have been that the secret covered up was the
secret of appeasement somehow obtained, somehow extorted and cherished;
and the difference between the two kinds of hiding was too great to
permit of a mistake. Charlotte was hiding neither pride nor joy--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
was hiding humiliation; and here it was that the Princess's passion,
so powerless for vindictive flights, most inveterately bruised its
tenderness against the hard glass of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) question.

<p/>Behind the glass lurked the WHOLE history of the relation she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had so
fairly flattened her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) nose against it to penetrate--the glass Mrs. Verver
might, at this stage, have been frantically tapping, from within, by
way of supreme, irrepressible entreaty. Maggie had said to herself
complacently, after that last passage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stepmother in the garden
of Fawns, that there was nothing left for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to do and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could
thereupon fold her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hands. But why wasn't it still left to push further
and, from the point of view of personal pride, grovel lower?--why wasn't
it still left to offer herself as the bearer of a message reporting to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) their friend's anguish and convincing him (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) need?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could thus have translated Mrs. Verver's tap against the glass, as I
have called it, into fifty forms; could perhaps have translated it most
into the form of a reminder that would pierce deep. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know what
it is to have been loved and broken with. You haven't been broken with,
because in your RELATION what can there have been, worth speaking of, to
break? Ours was everything a relation could be, filled to the brim with
the wine of consciousness; and if it was to have no meaning, no better
meaning than that such a creature as you could breathe upon it, at your
hour, for blight, why was I myself dealt with all for deception? why
condemned after a couple of short years to find the golden flame--oh,
the golden flame!--a mere handful of black ashes?''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>Our young woman
so yielded, at moments, to what was insidious in these foredoomed
ingenuities of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pity, that for minutes together, sometimes, the
weight of a new duty seemed to rest upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--the duty of speaking
before separation should constitute its chasm, of pleading for some
benefit that might be carried away into exile like the last saved object
of price of the emigre, the jewel wrapped in a piece of old silk and
negotiable some day in the market of misery.

<p/>This imagined service to the woman who could no longer help herself was
one of the traps set for Maggie's spirit at every turn of the road;
the click of which, catching and holding the divine faculty fast, was
followed inevitably by a flutter, by a struggle of wings and even, as
we may say, by a scattering of fine feathers. For they promptly enough
felt, these yearnings of thought and excursions of sympathy, the
concussion that couldn't bring them down--the arrest produced by the so
remarkably distinct figure that, at Fawns, for the previous weeks, was
constantly crossing, in its regular revolution, the further end of any
watched perspective. Whoever knew, or whoever didn't, whether or to what
extent Charlotte, with natural business in Eaton Square, had shuffled
other opportunities under that cloak, it was all matter for the kind of
quiet ponderation the little man who so kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wandering way had made
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. It was part of the very inveteracy of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) straw hat and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
white waistcoat, of the trick of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets, of the
detachment of the attention he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slow steps from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
secure pince-nez. The thing that never failed now as an item in the
picture was that gleam of the silken noose, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's immaterial
tether, so marked to Maggie's sense during her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) last month in the
country. Mrs. Verver's straight neck had certainly not slipped it;
nor had the other end of the long cord--oh, quite conveniently
long!--disengaged its smaller loop from the hooked thumb that, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers closed upon it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband kept out of sight. To have
recognised, for all its tenuity, the play of this gathered lasso might
inevitably be to wonder with what magic it was twisted, to what tension
subjected, but could never be to doubt either of its adequacy to its
office or of its perfect durability. These reminded states for the
Princess were in fact states of renewed gaping. So many things her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
father knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) even yet didn't!

<p/>All this, at present, with Mrs. Assingham, passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) in quick
vibrations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had expressed, while the revolution of her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) thought
was incomplete, the idea of what Amerigo <div class="bookquote">``ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div>on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side, in the
premises, to be capable of, and then had felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) companion's answering
stare. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) insisted on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had meant. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ought to wish to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)--and I mean in some protected and independent way, as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) used to--in
case of her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) being herself able to manage it. That,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie with the
courage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) conviction, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ought to be ready, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ought to be happy,
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ought to feel himself sworn--little as it is for the end of such
a history!--to take from her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>). It's as if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wished to get off without
taking anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham deferentially mused. <div class="bookquote">``But for what purpose is it your
idea that they should again so intimately meet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For any purpose they like. That's THEIR affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny Assingham sharply laughed, then irrepressibly fell back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
constant position. <div class="bookquote">``You're splendid--perfectly splendid.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>To which, as
the Princess, shaking an impatient head, wouldn't have it again at all,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) subjoined: <div class="bookquote">``Or if you're not it's because you're so sure. I mean
sure of HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I'm exactly NOT sure of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). If I were sure of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) I shouldn't
doubt--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>But Maggie cast about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubt what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny pressed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) waited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must feel how much less than she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pays--and how that
ought to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) present to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>This, in its turn, after an instant, Mrs. Assingham could meet with a
smile. <div class="bookquote">``Trust him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), my dear, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) present! But trust him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) also to
keep himself absent. Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll leave him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie. <div class="bookquote">``Only--you know it's my
nature--I THINK.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's your nature to think too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny Assingham a trifle coarsely
risked.

<p/>This but quickened, however, in the Princess the act she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) reprobated.
<div class="bookquote">``That may be. But if I hadn't thought--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't, you mean, have been where you are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, because they, on their side, thought of everything BUT that. They
thought of everything but that I might think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or even,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) friend too superficially concurred, <div class="bookquote">``that your father
might!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>As to this, at all events, Maggie discriminated. <div class="bookquote">``No, that wouldn't have
prevented them; for they knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) first care would be not to make
me do so. As it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie added, <div class="bookquote">``that has had to become his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny Assingham took it in deeper--for what it immediately made her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) give
out louder. <div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'S splendid then.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) sounded it almost aggressively; it
was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) was reduced to--she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) had positively to place it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that as much as you please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie said this and left it, but the tone of it had the next moment
determined in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend a fresh reaction. <div class="bookquote">``You think, both of you, so
abysmally and yet so quietly. But it's what will have saved you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie returned, <div class="bookquote">``it's what--from the moment they discovered we
could think at all--will have saved THEM. For they're the ones who are
saved,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``We're the ones who are lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lost--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lost to each other--father and I.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>And then as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend appeared to
demur, <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Maggie quite lucidly declared, <div class="bookquote">``lost to each other much
more, really, than Amerigo and Charlotte are; since for them it's just,
it's right, it's deserved, while for us it's only sad and strange and
not caused by our fault. But I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``why I talk
about myself, for it's on father it really comes. I let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but you don't make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I take it from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what else can you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I take it from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess repeated. <div class="bookquote">``I do what I knew from the
first I SHOULD do. I get off by giving him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gives you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Assingham presumed to object. <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't it
moreover then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``complete the very purpose with which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
married--that of making you and leaving you more free?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) long. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--I help him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Assingham hesitated, but at last her (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>) bravery flared. <div class="bookquote">``Why not call
it then frankly his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) complete success?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``that's all that's left me to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a success,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) friend ingeniously developed, <div class="bookquote">``with which you've
simply not interfered.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>And as if to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) spoke without levity
Mrs. Assingham went further. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has made it a success for THEM--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie responsively mused. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said the next
moment, <div class="bookquote">``that's why Amerigo stays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let alone it's why Charlotte goes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>that Mrs. Assingham, and
emboldened, smiled <div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knows--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>But Maggie hung back. <div class="bookquote">``Amerigo--?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After which, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) blushed--to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion's recognition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knows what YOU know? I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny faltered--<div class="bookquote">``well,
how much does he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Maggie's silence and Maggie's eyes had in fact
arrested the push of the question--which, for a decent consistency, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
couldn't yet quite abandon. <div class="bookquote">``What I should rather say is does he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) know
how much?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) found it still awkward. <div class="bookquote">``How much, I mean, they did. How
far'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) touched it up--<div class="bookquote">``they went.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie had waited, but only with a question. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Know at least something? Oh, about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) I can't think. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s beyond me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>said Fanny Assingham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then do you yourself know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How far--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny had appeared to wish to make sure, but there was something she (<font color='blue'><b>Assingham</b></font>)
remembered--remembered in time and even with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``I've told you
before that I know absolutely nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--that's what _I_ know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) friend again hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Then nobody knows--? I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Assingham explained, <div class="bookquote">``how much your father does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Assingham/Assingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, Maggie showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) understood. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not--a little--Charlotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess echoed. <div class="bookquote">``To know anything would be, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), to
know enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) doesn't know anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie answered, <div class="bookquote">``Amerigo would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's just it--that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess profoundly.

<p/>On which Mrs. Assingham reflected. <div class="bookquote">``Then how is Charlotte so held?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just by that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ignorance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ignorance.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>Fanny wondered. <div class="bookquote">``A torment--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A torment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) companion a moment watched them. <div class="bookquote">``But the Prince then--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is HE (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) held?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is HE (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) held?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can't tell you that!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>And the Princess again broke off.



<p/>XLI

<p/>A telegram, in Charlotte's name, arrived early--<div class="bookquote">``We shall come and ask
you for tea at five, if convenient to you. Am wiring for the Assinghams
to lunch.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>This document, into which meanings were to be read, Maggie
promptly placed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband, adding the remark that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father
and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife, who would have come up the previous night or that morning,
had evidently gone to an hotel. The Prince was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``own''  (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div>room, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) often sat now alone; half-a-dozen open newspapers, the <div class="bookquote">``Figaro''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>notably, as well as the <div class="bookquote">``Times,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>were scattered about him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); but, with a
cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) teeth and a visible cloud on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) brow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) appeared actually
to be engaged in walking to and fro. Never yet, on thus approaching
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had done it of late, under one necessity or another,
several times--had a particular impression so greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); supremely
strong, for some reason, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) turned quickly round on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) entrance. The
reason was partly the look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) face--a suffusion like the flush of
fever, which brought back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) Fanny Assingham's charge, recently
uttered under that roof, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``thinking''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Assingham</b></font>)</div>too impenetrably. The word
had remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) think still more; so that, at first,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stood there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt responsible for provoking on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) part an
irritation of suspense at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had not aimed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had been going
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) these three months, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) perfectly knew, with a maintained
idea--of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had never spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); but what had at last
happened was that his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) way of looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), on occasion, seemed a
perception of the presence not of one idea, but of fifty, variously
prepared for uses with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) somehow must reckon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) knew herself
suddenly, almost strangely, glad to be coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), at this hour, with
nothing more abstract than a telegram; but even after she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had stepped
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) prison under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) pretext, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes took in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) face
and then embraced the four walls that enclosed his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) restlessness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
recognised the virtual identity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) condition with that aspect of
Charlotte's situation for which, early in the summer and in all the
amplitude of a great residence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had found, with so little seeking,
the similitude of the locked cage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as caged, the man
who couldn't now without an instant effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sensibility give an
instinctive push to the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had not completely closed behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been turning twenty ways, for impatiences all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was once shut in with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) it was yet again as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more than monastic cell to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) light or food. There was
a difference none the less, between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) captivity and Charlotte's--the
difference, as it might be, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lurking there by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own act and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own choice; the admission of which had indeed virtually been in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) starting, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) entrance, as if even this were in its degree an
interference. That was what betrayed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), practically, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fear of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fifty ideas, and what had begun, after a minute, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wish to
repudiate or explain. It was more wonderful than she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could have told;
it was for all the world as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was succeeding with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
intention. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had, for these instants, the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exaggerated,
that the imputation of purpose had fairly risen too high in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
begun, a year ago, by asking herself how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) think more
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); but what was it, after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thinking now? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) telegram; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read it more than once, easy as it was, in
spite of its conveyed deprecation, to understand; during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) found
herself almost awestruck with yearning, almost on the point of marking
somehow what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had marked in the garden at Fawns with Charlotte--that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had truly come unarmed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) didn't bristle with intentions--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
scarce knew, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at this juncture affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), what had become of the
only intention she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had come with. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) old idea, the
old one he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hadn't the ghost of another. Presently in fact,
when four or five minutes had elapsed, it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) positively,
hadn't so much even as that one. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) back her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) paper, asking with
it if there were anything in particular she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stood there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), doubling the telegram together
as if it had been a precious thing and yet all the while holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
breath. Of a sudden, somehow, and quite as by the action of their merely
having between them these few written words, an extraordinary fact came
up. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were hers, hers in a degree and on a
scale, with an intensity and an intimacy, that were a new and a strange
quantity, that were like the irruption of a tide loosening them where
they had stuck and making them feel they floated. What was it that, with
the rush of this, just kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) from putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hands to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), from
catching at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as, in the other time, with the superficial impetus he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
and Charlotte had privately conspired to impart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had so often, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
breath failing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), known the impulse to catch at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father? She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
did, however, just yet, nothing inconsequent--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) couldn't
immediately have said what saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); and by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had neatly
folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) telegram she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was doing something merely needful. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted
you simply to know--so that you mayn't by accident miss them. For it's
the last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I take it as their good-bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) smiled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could always smile.
<div class="bookquote">``They come in state--to take formal leave. They do everything that's
proper. Tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``they go to Southampton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If they do everything that's proper,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince presently asked, <div class="bookquote">``why
don't they at least come to dine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hesitated, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) lightly enough provided her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) answer. <div class="bookquote">``That we
must certainly ask them. It will be easy for you. But of course they're
immensely taken--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``So immensely taken that they can't--that your father
can't--give you his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) last evening in England?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>This, for Maggie, was more difficult to meet; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was still not
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) stop-gap. <div class="bookquote">``That may be what they'll propose--that we shall
go somewhere together, the four of us, for a celebration--except that,
to round it thoroughly off, we ought also to have Fanny and the Colonel.
They don't WANT them at tea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) quite sufficiently expresses; they
polish them off, poor dears, they get rid of them, beforehand. They want
only us together; and if they cut us down to tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``as
they cut Fanny and the Colonel down to luncheon, perhaps it's for the
fancy, after all, of their keeping their last night in London for each
other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said these things as they came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was unable to keep them
back, even though, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) heard herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have been throwing
everything to the winds. But wasn't that the right way--for sharing his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
last day of captivity with the man one adored? It was every moment more
and more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) were waiting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) prison--waiting
with some gleam of remembrance of how noble captives in the French
Revolution, the darkness of the Terror, used to make a feast, or a
high discourse, of their last poor resources. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had broken with
everything now, every observance of all the past months, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) must simply
then take it so--take it that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had worked for was too near,
at last, to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might have been losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head
verily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband's eyes--since he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) didn't know, all the while, that
the sudden freedom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) words was but the diverted intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
disposition personally to seize him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) didn't know, either, that this
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) manner--now she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--of beguiling audaciously the
supremacy of suspense. For the people of the French Revolution,
assuredly, there wasn't suspense; the scaffold, for those she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was
thinking of, was certain--whereas what Charlotte's telegram announced
was, short of some incalculable error, clear liberation. Just the
point, however, was in its being clearer to herself than to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
clearnesses, clearances--those she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had so all but abjectly laboured
for--threatened to crowd upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in the form of one of the clusters
of angelic heads, the peopled shafts of light beating down through iron
bars, that regale, on occasion, precisely, the fevered vision of those
who are in chains. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was going to know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt, later on--was going
to know with compunction, doubtless, on the very morrow, how thumpingly
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) heart had beaten at this foretaste of their being left together:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should judge at leisure the surrender she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was making to the
consciousness of complications about to be bodily lifted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should
judge at leisure even that avidity for an issue which was making so
little of any complication but the unextinguished presence of the
others; and indeed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was already simplifying so much more than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband came out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) next in the face with which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) listened.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might certainly well be puzzled, in respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father-in-law
and Mrs. Verver, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) glance at their possible preference for a
concentrated evening. <div class="bookquote">``But it isn't--is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked--<div class="bookquote">``as if they were
leaving each other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; it isn't as if they were leaving each other. They're only
bringing to a close--without knowing when it may open again--a time that
has been, naturally, awfully interesting to them.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) could talk
so of their <div class="bookquote">``time'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was somehow sustained; she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) was sustained even to
affirm more intensely her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) present possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) ground. <div class="bookquote">``They have
their reasons--many things to think of; how can one tell? But there's
always, also, the chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) proposing to me that we shall have our
last hours together; I mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and I shall. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) may wish to take
me off to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) somewhere alone--and to do it in memory of old
days. I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess went on, <div class="bookquote">``the real old days; before my grand
husband was invented and, much more, before his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) grand wife was: the
wonderful times of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) first great interest in what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has since done,
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) first great plans and opportunities, discoveries and bargains. The
way we've sat together late, ever so late, in foreign restaurants, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) used to like; the way that, in every city in Europe, we've stayed on
and on, with our elbows on the table and most of the lights put out, to
talk over things he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had that day seen or heard of or made his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) offer for,
the things he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had secured or refused or lost! There were places he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took
me to--you wouldn't believe!--for often he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could only have left me with
servants. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should carry me off with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to-night, for old sake's
sake, to the Earl's Court Exhibition, it will be a little--just a very,
very little--like our young adventures.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>After which while Amerigo
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and in fact quite because of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had an inspiration, to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) presently yielded. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was wondering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would say
next she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had found exactly the thing. <div class="bookquote">``In that case he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) will leave you
Charlotte to take care of in our absence. You'll have to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) off
somewhere for your last evening; unless you may prefer to spend it with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) here. I shall then see that you dine, that you have everything,
quite beautifully. You'll be able to do as you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) couldn't have been sure beforehand, and had really not been; but
the most immediate result of this speech was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) see that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took it for no cheap extravagance either of irony or of oblivion.
Nothing in the world, of a truth, had ever been so sweet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
look of trying to be serious enough to make no mistake about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--which hadn't been at all her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) purpose; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) mystified
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) couldn't help and, comparatively, didn't mind; then it
came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had, after all, a simplicity, very considerable,
on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had never dared to presume. It was a discovery--not like
the other discovery she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had once made, but giving out a freshness; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) recognised again in the light of it the number of the ideas of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) capable. They were all, apparently, queer for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had at least, with the lapse of the months, created the perception
that there might be something in them; whereby he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stared there,
beautiful and sombre, at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was at present providing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with.
There was something of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind, to which, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
referred everything for a measure and a meaning; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had never let go
of it, from the evening, weeks before, when, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) room, after his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
encounter with the Bloomsbury cup, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had planted it there by flinging
it at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), on the question of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) father's view of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) determined
<div class="bookquote">``Find out for yourself!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had been aware, during the months, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had been trying to find out, and had been seeking, above all, to avoid
the appearance of any evasions of such a form of knowledge as might
reach him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), with violence or with a penetration more insidious, from any
other source. Nothing, however, had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could at
all conveniently reckon with had disengaged itself for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) even from
the announcement, sufficiently sudden, of the final secession of their
companions. Charlotte was in pain, Charlotte was in torment, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
himself had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) reason enough for that; and, in respect to the
rest of the whole matter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) obligation to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband, that
personage and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), Maggie, had so shuffled away every link between
consequence and cause, that the intention remained, like some famous
poetic line in a dead language, subject to varieties of interpretation.
What renewed the obscurity was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) strange image of their common offer
to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own, of an opportunity to separate from
Mrs. Verver with the due amount of form--and all the more that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was,
in so pathetic a way, unable to treat himself to a quarrel with it on
the score of taste. Taste, in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as a touchstone, was now all at sea;
for who could say but that one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) fifty ideas, or perhaps forty-nine
of them, wouldn't be, exactly, that taste by itself, the taste he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
always conformed to, had no importance whatever? If meanwhile, at all
events, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) as serious, this made the greater reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
profiting by it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) perhaps might never be able to profit again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
was invoking that reflection at the very moment he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brought out, in
reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) last words, a remark which, though perfectly relevant and
perfectly just, affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) at first as a high oddity. <div class="bookquote">``They're doing
the wisest thing, you know. For if they were ever to go--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) over his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cigar.

<p/>If they were ever to go, in short, it was high time, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) father's
age, Charlotte's need of initiation, and the general magnitude of the
job of their getting settled and seasoned, their learning to <div class="bookquote">``live into''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>their queer future--it was high time that they should take up their
courage. This was eminent sense, but it didn't arrest the Princess, who,
the next moment, had found a form for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) challenge. <div class="bookquote">``But shan't you
then so much as miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a little? She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s wonderful and beautiful, and I
feel somehow as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) were dying. Not really, not physically,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie
went on--<div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s so far, naturally, splendid as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is, from having done
with life. But dying for us--for you and me; and making us feel it by
the very fact of there being so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince smoked hard a minute. <div class="bookquote">``As you say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s splendid, but there
is--there always will be--much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) left. Only, as you also say, for
others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>the Princess returned, <div class="bookquote">``that it isn't as if we had
wholly done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). How can we not always think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)? It's as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
unhappiness had been necessary to us--as if we had needed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
own cost, to build us up and start us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) took it in with consideration, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) met it with a lucid inquiry.
<div class="bookquote">``Why do you speak of the unhappiness of your father's wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>They exchanged a long look--the time that it took her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) reply.
<div class="bookquote">``Because not to--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, not to--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would make me have to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). And I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie, <div class="bookquote">``speak
of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You `can't'--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said it as for definite notice, not to be repeated.
<div class="bookquote">``There are too many things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) nevertheless added. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s too great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) cigar-tip, and then as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) put back the weed:
<div class="bookquote">``Too great for whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Upon which as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) hesitated, <div class="bookquote">``Not, my dear, too
great for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) declared. <div class="bookquote">``For me--oh, as much as you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too great for me is what I mean. I know why I think it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie said.
<div class="bookquote">``That's enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) yet again as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) but fanned his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wonder; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was on
the very point, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) judged, of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thought it. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
own eyes maintained their warning, and at the end of a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
uttered other words. <div class="bookquote">``What's of importance is that you're his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter.
That at least we've got. And I suppose that, if I may say nothing else,
I may say at least that I value it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, you may say that you value it. I myself make the most of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This again he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) took in, letting it presently put forth for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) a striking
connection. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) ought to have known you. That's what's present to me.
She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) ought to have understood you better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better than you did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) gravely maintained, <div class="bookquote">``better than I did. And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) didn't really
know you at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) doesn't know you now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) does!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) head--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) meant. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) not only doesn't
understand you more than I, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) understands you ever so much less.
Though even I--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, even you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie pressed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``Even I, even I even
yet--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) paused and the silence held them.

<p/>But Maggie at last broke it. <div class="bookquote">``If Charlotte doesn't understand me, it is
that I've prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). I've chosen to deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) and to lie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I know what you've chosen to do. But
I've chosen to do the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie after an instant--<div class="bookquote">``my choice was made when I had
guessed yours. But you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) understands YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It presents small difficulty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you so sure?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure enough. But it doesn't matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) waited an instant; then looking
up through the fumes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) smoke, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s stupid,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) abruptly opined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O--oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie protested in a long wail.

<p/>It had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in fact quickly change colour. <div class="bookquote">``What I mean is that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s not, as you pronounce her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), unhappy.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) recovered, with this,
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) logic. <div class="bookquote">``Why is she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) unhappy if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) doesn't know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't know--?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) tried to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) logic difficult.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't know that YOU know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It came from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in such a way that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was conscious, instantly, of
three or four things to answer. But what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) said first was: <div class="bookquote">``Do you
think that's all it need take?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And before he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could reply, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knows,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knows!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Maggie proclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) turned impatiently away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I needn't tell you! She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knows enough. Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
doesn't believe us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It made the Prince stare a little. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) asks too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>That drew,
however, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife another moan of objection, which determined in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) a judgment. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) won't let you take her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know better than any one else what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) won't let me take her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
for!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div>said Amerigo, <div class="bookquote">``you'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amerigo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall see wonders, I know. I've already seen them, and I'm
prepared for them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie recalled--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had memories enough. <div class="bookquote">``It's
terrible'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) memories prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to speak. <div class="bookquote">``I see it's ALWAYS
terrible for women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The Prince looked down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) gravity. <div class="bookquote">``Everything's terrible, cara, in
the heart of man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s making her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) life,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'ll make it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife turned back upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had wandered to a table, vaguely
setting objects straight. <div class="bookquote">``A little by the way then too, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s
about it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s making ours.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At this he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes, which met her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) delivered herself of some thing that had
been with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) these last minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You spoke just now of Charlotte's not having learned from you that
I `know.' Am I to take from you then that you accept and recognise my
knowledge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) did the inquiry all the honours--visibly weighed its importance and
weighed his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) response. <div class="bookquote">``You think I might have been showing you that a
little more handsomely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't a question of any beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie; <div class="bookquote">``it's only a question
of the quantity of truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the quantity of truth!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince richly, though ambiguously,
murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a thing by itself, yes. But there are also such things, all the
same, as questions of good faith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course there are!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>the Prince hastened to reply. After which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
brought up more slowly: <div class="bookquote">``If ever a man, since the beginning of time,
acted in good faith!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) dropped it, offering it simply for that.

<p/>For that then, when it had had time somewhat to settle, like some
handful of gold-dust thrown into the air--for that then Maggie showed
herself, as deeply and strangely taking it. <div class="bookquote">``I see.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) even wished
this form to be as complete as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could make it. <div class="bookquote">``I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The completeness, clearly, after an instant, had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) as divine.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear, my dear, my dear--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could say.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wasn't talking, however, at large. <div class="bookquote">``You've kept up for so long a
silence--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I know what I've kept up. But will you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``still
one thing more for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as if, for an instant, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) new exposure, it had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
turn pale. <div class="bookquote">``Is there even one thing left?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear, my dear, my dear!'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--it had pressed again in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) the fine
spring of the unspeakable. There was nothing, however, that the Princess
herself couldn't say. <div class="bookquote">``I'll do anything, if you'll tell me what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then wait.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) raised Italian hand, with its play of admonitory
fingers, had never made gesture more expressive. His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) voice itself
dropped to a tone--! <div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) understood, but it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wished to have it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Till
they've been here, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, till they've gone. Till they're away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) kept it up. <div class="bookquote">``Till they've left the country?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
for clearness; these were the conditions of a promise--so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) put
the promise, practically, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) response. <div class="bookquote">``Till we've ceased to see
them--for as long as God may grant! Till we're really alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if it's only that--!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had drawn from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) thus then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
could feel, the thick breath of the definite--which was the intimate,
the immediate, the familiar, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hadn't had them for so long--she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
turned away again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hand on the knob of the door. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
hand rested at first without a grasp; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had another effort to make,
the effort of leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), of which everything that had just passed
between them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) presence, irresistible, overcharged with it, doubled
the difficulty. There was something--she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) couldn't have told what; it was
as if, shut in together, they had come too far--too far for where they
were; so that the mere act of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) quitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was like the attempt to
recover the lost and gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had taken in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) something that,
within the ten minutes, and especially within the last three or four,
had slipped away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)--which it was vain now, wasn't it? to try to
appear to clutch or to pick up. That consciousness in fact had a pang,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) balanced, intensely, for the lingering moment, almost with a
terror of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) endless power of surrender. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had only to press, really,
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) to yield inch by inch, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) fairly knew at present, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) cloud, that the confession of this precious
secret sat there for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to pluck. The sensation, for the few seconds,
was extraordinary; her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) weakness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) desire, so long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was yet not
saving herself, flowered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) face like a light or a darkness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
sought for some word that would cover this up; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) reverted to the
question of tea, speaking as if they shouldn't meet sooner. <div class="bookquote">``Then about
five. I count on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>On him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) too, however, something had descended; as to which this exactly
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) chance. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I shall see you--! No?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said, coming
nearer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hand still on the knob, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) back against the door, so
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) retreat, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) approach must be less than a step, and yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) couldn't for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) life, with the other hand, have pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) away.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was so near now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) could touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), taste him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), smell him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>),
kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) almost pressed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and the warmth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
face--frowning, smiling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) mightn't know which; only beautiful and
strange--was bent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) with the largeness with which objects loom in
dreams. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) eyes to it, and so, the next instant, against her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
purpose, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hand, which had met his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
held. Then it was that, from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) closed eyes, the right word
came. <div class="bookquote">``Wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was the word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own distress and entreaty, the word
for both of them, all they had left, their plank now on the great sea.
Their hands were locked, and thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said it again. <div class="bookquote">``Wait. Wait.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) eyes shut, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) knew, helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) meaning--which
after a minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was aware his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own had absorbed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) go--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
turned away with this message, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) again his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) back was
presented, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) face staring out of the window.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had saved herself and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) got off.



<p/>XLII

<p/>Later on, in the afternoon, before the others arrived, the form of their
reunion was at least remarkable: they might, in their great eastward
drawing-room, have been comparing notes or nerves in apprehension of
some stiff official visit. Maggie's mind, in its restlessness, even
played a little with the prospect; the high cool room, with its
afternoon shade, with its old tapestries uncovered, with the perfect
polish of its wide floor reflecting the bowls of gathered flowers and
the silver and linen of the prepared tea-table, drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a remark
in which this whole effect was mirrored, as well as something else
in the Prince's movement while he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) slowly paced and turned. <div class="bookquote">``We're
distinctly bourgeois!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) a trifle grimly threw off, as an echo of
their old community; though to a spectator sufficiently detached they
might have been quite the privileged pair they were reputed, granted
only they were taken as awaiting the visit of Royalty. They might have
been ready, on the word passed up in advance, to repair together to the
foot of the staircase--the Prince somewhat in front, advancing indeed to
the open doors and even going down, for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) princedom, to meet, on
the stopping of the chariot, the august emergence. The time was stale,
it was to be admitted, for incidents of magnitude; the September hush
was in full possession, at the end of the dull day, and a couple of the
long windows stood open to the balcony that overhung the desolation--
the balcony from which Maggie, in the springtime, had seen Amerigo and
Charlotte look down together at the hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) return from the Regent's
Park, near by, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father, the Principino and Miss Bogle. Amerigo
now again, in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) punctual impatience, went out a couple of times and
stood there; after which, as to report that nothing was in sight, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
returned to the room with frankly nothing else to do. The Princess
pretended to read; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) passed; there hovered in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) own sense the thought of other occasions when she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had cheated
appearances of agitation with a book. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) felt him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) standing
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember how, this morning, when you told me of this event, I
asked you if there were anything particular you wished me to do? You
spoke of my being at home, but that was a matter of course. You spoke of
something else,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went on, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) book on her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) knee and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) raised eyes; <div class="bookquote">``something that makes me almost wish it may happen.
You spoke,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``of the possibility of my seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) alone. Do you
know, if that comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``the use I shall make of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) waited: <div class="bookquote">``The use is all before me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, it's your own business now!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife. But it had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
rise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall make it my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I shall tell her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) I lied to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shall tell her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) head again. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, still less!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With which therefore they stood at difference, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head erect
and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) happy idea perched, in its eagerness, on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) crest. <div class="bookquote">``And how
then is she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) isn't to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s only still to think you don't--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore that I'm always a fool? She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) may think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie,
<div class="bookquote">``what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think it without my protest--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>The Princess made a movement. <div class="bookquote">``What business is it of yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it my right to correct her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie let his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) question ring--ring long enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to hear it
himself; only then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) took it up. ```Correct' her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)?''--and it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own
now that really rang. ``Aren't you rather forgetting who she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is?'' After
which, while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quite stared for it, as it was the very first clear
majesty he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) to use, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) flung down her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) book and raised a
warning hand. <div class="bookquote">``The carriage. Come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The <div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had matched, for lucid firmness, the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) speech,
and, when they were below, in the hall, there was a <div class="bookquote">``Go!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),
through the open doors and between the ranged servants, that matched
even that. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) received Royalty, bareheaded, therefore, in the persons of
Mr. and Mrs. Verver, as it alighted on the pavement, and Maggie was at
the threshold to welcome it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) house. Later on, upstairs again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
even herself felt still more the force of the limit of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
had just reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); at tea, in Charlotte's affirmed presence--as
Charlotte affirmed it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) drew a long breath of richer relief. It was
the strangest, once more, of all impressions; but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) most felt,
for the half-hour, was that Mr. and Mrs. Verver were making the occasion
easy. They were somehow conjoined in it, conjoined for a present effect
as Maggie had absolutely never yet seen them; and there occurred, before
long, a moment in which Amerigo's look met her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own in recognitions that
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) couldn't suppress. The question of the amount of correction to which
Charlotte had laid herself open rose and hovered, for the instant, only
to sink, conspicuously, by its own weight; so high a pitch she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) seemed
to give to the unconsciousness of questions, so resplendent a show of
serenity she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) succeeded in making. The shade of the official, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
beauty and security, never for a moment dropped; it was a cool, high
refuge, like the deep, arched recess of some coloured and gilded image,
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sat and smiled and waited, drank her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tea, referred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
husband and remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mission. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mission had quite taken form--it
was but another name for the interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) great opportunity--that of
representing the arts and the graces to a people languishing, afar
off, in ignorance. Maggie had sufficiently intimated to the Prince,
ten minutes before, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) needed no showing as to what their friend
wouldn't consent to be taken for; but the difficulty now indeed was to
choose, for explicit tribute of admiration, between the varieties of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
nobler aspects. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) carried it off, to put the matter coarsely, with a
taste and a discretion that held our young woman's attention, for the
first quarter-of-an-hour, to the very point of diverting it from the
attitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) overshadowed, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) almost superseded companion. But Adam
Verver profited indeed at this time, even with his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) daughter, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) so
marked peculiarity of seeming on no occasion to have an attitude; and so
long as they were in the room together she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) still simply weave
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) web and play out his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) long fine cord, knew herself in presence of
this tacit process very much as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had known herself at Fawns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had
a way, the dear man, wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, of moving about the room,
noiselessly, to see what it might contain; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner of now
resorting to this habit, acquainted as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) already was with the objects
in view, expressed with a certain sharpness the intention of leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) devices. It did even more than this; it signified, to the
apprehension of the Princess, from the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) more directly took
thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), almost a special view of these devices, as actually
exhibited in their rarity, together with an independent, a settled
appreciation of their general handsome adequacy, which scarcely required
the accompaniment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faint contemplative hum.

<p/>Charlotte throned, as who should say, between her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hostess and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) host,
the whole scene having crystallised, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) place, to
the right quiet lustre; the harmony was not less sustained for being
superficial, and the only approach to a break in it was while Amerigo
remained standing long enough for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father-in-law, vaguely wondering,
to appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), invite or address him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and then, in default of any
such word, selected for presentation to the other visitor a plate of
petits fours. Maggie watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband--if it now could be called
watching--offer this refreshment; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) noted the consummate way--for
<div class="bookquote">``consummate''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was the term she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) privately applied--in which Charlotte
cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) acceptance, cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) impersonal smile, of any betrayal,
any slightest value, of consciousness; and then felt the slow surge of a
vision that, at the end of another minute or two, had floated her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
across the room to where her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father stood looking at a picture, an early
Florentine sacred subject, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
might have been, in silence, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) last leave of it; it was a
work for which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entertained, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew, an unqualified esteem. The
tenderness represented for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sacrifice of such a treasure had
become, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sense, a part of the whole infusion, of the immortal
expression; the beauty of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sentiment looked out at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), always, from
the beauty of the rest, as if the frame made positively a window for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
spiritual face: she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might have said to herself, at this moment, that in
leaving the thing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), held as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) clasping arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was doing
the most possible toward leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) palpable self.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shoulder, and their eyes were held again,
together, by the abiding felicity; they smiled in emulation, vaguely,
as if speech failed them through their having passed too far; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would
have begun to wonder the next minute if it were reserved to them, for
the last stage, to find their contact, like that of old friends reunited
too much on the theory of the unchanged, subject to shy lapses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear--rather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had applied the question to the great fact of the picture, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had spoken for the picture in reply, but it was as if their words for an
instant afterwards symbolised another truth, so that they looked about
at everything else to give them this extension. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) arm
into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and the other objects in the room, the other pictures, the
sofas, the chairs, the tables, the cabinets, the <div class="bookquote">``important''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>pieces,
supreme in their way, stood out, round them, consciously, for
recognition and applause. Their eyes moved together from piece to piece,
taking in the whole nobleness--quite as if for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to measure the wisdom
of old ideas. The two noble persons seated, in conversation, at tea,
fell thus into the splendid effect and the general harmony: Mrs. Verver
and the Prince fairly <div class="bookquote">``placed''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>themselves, however unwittingly, as high
expressions of the kind of human furniture required, esthetically, by
such a scene. The fusion of their presence with the decorative elements,
their contribution to the triumph of selection, was complete and
admirable; though, to a lingering view, a view more penetrating than
the occasion really demanded, they also might have figured as concrete
attestations of a rare power of purchase. There was much indeed in
the tone in which Adam Verver spoke again, and who shall say where his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
thought stopped? <div class="bookquote">``Le compte y est.. You've got some good things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>Maggie met it afresh--<div class="bookquote">``Ah, don't they look well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Their companions, at
the sound of this, gave them, in a spacious intermission of slow talk,
an attention, all of gravity, that was like an ampler submission to the
general duty of magnificence; sitting as still, to be thus appraised, as
a pair of effigies of the contemporary great on one of the platforms of
Madame Tussaud. <div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad--for your last look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div><p/>With which, after Maggie--quite in the air--had said it, the note was
struck indeed; the note of that strange accepted finality of relation,
as from couple to couple, which almost escaped an awkwardness only by
not attempting a gloss. Yes, this was the wonder, that the occasion
defied insistence precisely because of the vast quantities with which it
dealt--so that separation was on a scale beyond any compass of parting.
To do such an hour justice would have been in some degree to question
its grounds--which was why they remained, in fine, the four of them, in
the upper air, united in the firmest abstention from pressure. There was
no point, visibly, at which, face to face, either Amerigo or Charlotte
had pressed; and how little she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) herself was in danger of doing so Maggie
scarce needed to remember. That her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father wouldn't, by the tip of a
toe--of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) was equally conscious: the only thing was that, since
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could but hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) breath for what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would do instead.
When, at the end of three minutes more, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said, with an effect of
suddenness, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Mag--and the Principino?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>it was quite as if that
were, by contrast, the hard, the truer voice.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) glanced at the clock. <div class="bookquote">``I `ordered' him (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) for half-past five--which
hasn't yet struck. Trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>), my dear, not to fail you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't want HIM to fail me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Verver</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Verver's reply; yet uttered
in so explicitly jocose a relation to the possibilities of failure that
even when, just afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) wandered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) impatience to one of the
long windows and passed out to the balcony, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) asked herself but for
a few seconds if reality, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>), would overtake or meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) of necessity--it came, absolutely, so near
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) inviting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>), by stepping off into temporary detachment, to
give the others something of the chance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband had so
fantastically discussed. Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) then, while they hung over the great
dull place, clear and almost coloured now, coloured with the odd, sad,
pictured, <div class="bookquote">``old-fashioned''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>look that empty London streets take on in
waning afternoons of the summer's end, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) felt once more how impossible
such a passage would have been to them, how it would have torn them to
pieces, if they had so much as suffered its suppressed relations to peep
out of their eyes. This danger would doubtless indeed have been more to
be reckoned with if the instinct of each--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) could certainly at least
answer for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) own--had not so successfully acted to trump up other
apparent connexions for it, connexions as to which they could pretend to
be frank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't stay on here, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam Verver/Adam</b></font>)</div>Adam Verver said as a result of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) unobstructed outlook. <div class="bookquote">``Fawns is all there for you, of course--to
the end of my tenure. But Fawns so dismantled,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) added with mild
ruefulness, <div class="bookquote">``Fawns with half its contents, and half its best things,
removed, won't seem to you, I'm afraid, particularly lively.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>Maggie answered, <div class="bookquote">``we should miss its best things. Its best things,
my dear, have certainly been removed. To be back there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) went on,
<div class="bookquote">``to be back there--!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) paused for the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) idea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, to be back there without anything good--!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't hesitate
now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) idea forth. <div class="bookquote">``To be back there without Charlotte is
more than I think would do.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) with it, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) the next instant take it--take it in a way that helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
smile to pass all for an allusion to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) didn't and couldn't
say. This quantity was too clear--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) couldn't at such an hour be
pretending to name to him (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) what it was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) would have said, <div class="bookquote">``going to
be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at Fawns or anywhere else, to want for HIM. That was now--and in a
manner exaltedly, sublimely--out of their compass and their question;
so that what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doing, while they waited for the Principino,
while they left the others together and their tension just sensibly
threatened, what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) doing but just offer a bold but substantial
substitute? Nothing was stranger moreover, under the action of
Charlotte's presence, than the fact of a felt sincerity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) words.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sincerity absolutely sound--she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave it for all it might
mean. <div class="bookquote">``Because Charlotte, dear, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is incomparable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It took thirty seconds, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to know when these were over that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had pronounced one of the happiest words of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) life. They had
turned from the view of the street; they leaned together against the
balcony rail, with the room largely in sight from where they stood, but
with the Prince and Mrs. Verver out of range. Nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could try, she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>)
immediately saw, was to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes from lighting; not even his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) taking
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) cigarette-case and saying before he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said anything else: <div class="bookquote">``May I
smoke?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) met it, for encouragement, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``My dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>again, and
then, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) match, she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) had just another minute to be
nervous--a minute that she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) made use of, however, not in the least to
falter, but to reiterate with a high ring, a ring that might, for all
she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) cared, reach the pair inside: <div class="bookquote">``Father, father--Charlotte's great!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not till after he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had begun to smoke that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Charlotte's great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They could close upon it--such a basis as they might immediately feel
it make; and so they stood together over it, quite gratefully, each
recording to the other's eyes that it was firm under their feet. They
had even thus a renewed wait, as for proof of it; much as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
were letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) see, while the minutes lapsed for their concealed
companions, that this was finally just why--but just WHY! <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
presently added, <div class="bookquote">``how right I was. Right, I mean, to do it for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, rather!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) murmured with her (<font color='blue'><b>Verver</b></font>) smile. And then, as to be herself
ideally right: <div class="bookquote">``I don't see what you would have done without her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The point was,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) returned quietly, <div class="bookquote">``that I didn't see what you were
to do. Yet it was a risk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a risk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>said Maggie--<div class="bookquote">``but I believed in it. At least for
myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maggie/Maggie Verver</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well NOW,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) smoked, <div class="bookquote">``we see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but naturally!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>On which, as the warranted truth of it hung in
the air--the truth warranted, as who should say, exactly by the present
opportunity to pronounce, this opportunity created and accepted--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
found herself lost, though with a finer thrill than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) had perhaps yet
known, in the vision of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might mean. The sense of it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
rose higher, rose with each moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) thus to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
linger; and when, after a little more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had said, smoking again and
looking up, with head thrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail,
at the grey, gaunt front of the house, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s beautiful, beautiful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) sensibility reported to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) the shade of a new note. It was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
might have wished, for it was, with a kind of speaking competence, the
note of possession and control; and yet it conveyed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) as nothing
till now had done the reality of their parting. They were parting, in
the light of it, absolutely on Charlotte's VALUE--the value that was
filling the room out of which they had stepped as if to give it play,
and with which the Prince, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) side, was perhaps making larger
acquaintance. If Maggie had desired, at so late an hour, some last
conclusive comfortable category to place him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in for dismissal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) might
have found it here in its all coming back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) ability to rest upon
high values. Somehow, when all was said, and with the memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>)
gifts, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) variety, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) power, so much remained of Charlotte's! What
else had she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as
great? Great for the world that was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) proposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
should be: she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was not to be wasted in the application of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) plan.
Maggie held to this then--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) wasn't to be wasted. To let his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)
daughter know it he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) had sought this brief privacy. What a blessing,
accordingly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could speak her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) joy in it! His (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) face, meanwhile,
at all events, was turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) eyes again her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) joy
went straight. <div class="bookquote">``It's success, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's success. And even this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) added as the Principino, appearing
alone, deep within, piped across an instant greeting--<div class="bookquote">``even this isn't
altogether failure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They went in to receive the boy, upon whose introduction to the room
by Miss Bogle Charlotte and the Prince got up--seemingly with an
impressiveness that had caused Miss Bogle not to give further effect
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) own entrance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) had retired, but the Principino's presence, by
itself, sufficiently broke the tension--the subsidence of which, in the
great room, ten minutes later, gave to the air something of the quality
produced by the cessation of a sustained rattle. Stillness, when the
Prince and Princess returned from attending the visitors to their
carriage, might have been said to be not so much restored as created;
so that whatever next took place in it was foredoomed to remarkable
salience. That would have been the case even with so natural, though so
futile, a movement as Maggie's going out to the balcony again to follow
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) eyes her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) father's departure. The carriage was out of sight--it
had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) too long solemnly to reascend, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) looked awhile only
at the great grey space, on which, as on the room still more, the shadow
of dusk had fallen. Here, at first, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>) husband had not rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>Maggie</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had come up with the boy, who, clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand, abounded, as usual,
in remarks worthy of the family archives; but the two appeared then
to have proceeded to report to Miss Bogle. It meant something for the
Princess that her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) husband had thus got their son out of the way, not
bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother; but everything now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) vaguely
moved about, struck her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as meaning so much that the unheard chorus
swelled. Yet THIS above all--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) just being there as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was and waiting
for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to come in, their freedom to be together there always--was the
meaning most disengaged: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood in the cool twilight and took in, all
about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), where it lurked, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reason for what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had done. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew
at last really why--and how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been inspired and guided, how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had been persistently able, how, to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soul, all the while, it had
been for the sake of this end. Here it was, then, the moment, the golden
fruit that had shone from afar; only, what were these things, in the
fact, for the hand and for the lips, when tested, when tasted--what were
they as a reward? Closer than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had ever been to the measure of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
course and the full face of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) act, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had an instant of the terror
that, when there has been suspense, always precedes, on the part of the
creature to be paid, the certification of the amount. Amerigo knew it,
the amount; he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still held it, and the delay in his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) return, making her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
heart beat too fast to go on, was like a sudden blinding light on a wild
speculation. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had thrown the dice, but his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand was over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cast.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) opened the door, however, at last--he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hadn't been away ten minutes;
and then, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) renewed to intensity, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed to have
a view of the number. His (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) presence alone, as he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) paused to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
somehow made it the highest, and even before he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had spoken she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had begun
to be paid in full. With that consciousness, in fact, an extraordinary
thing occurred; the assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) safety so making her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) terror drop
that already, within the minute, it had been changed to concern for his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
own anxiety, for everything that was deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being and everything
that was fair in his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face. So far as seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``paid''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>went, he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
might have been holding out the money-bag for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to come and take it.
But what instantly rose, for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), between the act and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) acceptance was
the sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must strike him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as waiting for a confession. This, in
turn, charged her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with a new horror: if that was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) proper payment she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would go without money. His (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) acknowledgment hung there, too monstrously,
at the expense of Charlotte, before whose mastery of the greater style
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had just been standing dazzled. All she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) now knew, accordingly, was
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should be ashamed to listen to the uttered word; all, that is,
but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might dispose of it on the spot forever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) too splendid?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) simply said, offering it to explain and to
finish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, splendid!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With which he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's our help, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) added--to point further her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) moral.

<p/>It kept him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) therefore, taking in--or trying to--what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) so
wonderfully gave. He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tried, too clearly, to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own way; but with the result only that, close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) face kept
before him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shoulders, his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whole act enclosing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) presently echoed: ```See'? I see nothing but you.'' And the truth
of it had, with this force, after a moment, so strangely lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
eyes that, as for pity and dread of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own in his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
breast.
