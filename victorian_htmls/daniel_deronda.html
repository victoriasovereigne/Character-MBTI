<p/>DANIEL DERONDA

<p/>By George Eliot



<p/>Let thy chief terror be of thine own soul:
There, `mid the throng of hurrying desires
That trample on the dead to seize their spoil,
Lurks vengeance, footless, irresistible
As exhalations laden with slow death,
And o'er the fairest troop of captured joys
Breathes pallid pestilence.

<p/>DANIEL DERONDA.




<p/>BOOK I.--THE SPOILED CHILD.


<p/>CHAPTER I.

<p/>Men can do nothing without the make-believe of a beginning. Even
science, the strict measurer, is obliged to start with a make-believe
unit, and must fix on a point in the stars' unceasing journey when his (<font color='blue'><b>DERONDA</b></font>)
sidereal clock shall pretend that time is at Nought. His (<font color='blue'><b>DERONDA</b></font>) less accurate
grandmother Poetry has always been understood to start in the middle;
but on reflection it appears that her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) proceeding is not very different
from his (<font color='blue'><b>DERONDA</b></font>); since Science, too, reckons backward as well as forward,
divides his (<font color='blue'><b>DERONDA</b></font>) unit into billions, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>DERONDA</b></font>) clock-finger at Nought
really sets off _in medias res_. No retrospect will take us to
the true beginning; and whether our prologue be in heaven or on earth,
it is but a fraction of that all-presupposing fact with which our
story sets out.


<p/>Was she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) beautiful or not beautiful? and what was the secret of form or
expression which gave the dynamic quality to her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) glance? Was the good
or the evil genius dominant in those beams? Probably the evil; else why
was the effect that of unrest rather than of undisturbed charm? Why was
the wish to look again felt as coercion and not as a longing in which
the whole being consents?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) who raised these questions in Daniel Deronda's mind was occupied in
gambling: not in the open air under a southern sky, tossing coppers on
a ruined wall, with rags about her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) limbs; but in one of those splendid
resorts which the enlightenment of ages has prepared for the same
species of pleasure at a heavy cost of gilt mouldings, dark-toned
color and chubby nudities, all correspondingly heavy--forming a
suitable condenser for human breath belonging, in great part, to the
highest fashion, and not easily procurable to be breathed in elsewhere
in the like proportion, at least by persons of little fashion.

<p/>It was near four o'clock on a September day, so that the atmosphere was
well-brewed to a visible haze. There was deep stillness, broken only by
a light rattle, a light chink, a small sweeping sound, and an
occasional monotone in French, such as might be expected to issue from
an ingeniously constructed automaton. Round two long tables were
gathered two serried crowds of human beings, all save one having their
faces and attention bent on the tables. The one exception was a
melancholy little boy, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knees and calves simply in their
natural clothing of epidermis, but for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) person in a
fancy dress. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) alone had his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face turned toward the doorway, and
fixing on it the blank gaze of a bedizened child stationed as a
masquerading advertisement on the platform of an itinerant show, stood
close behind a lady deeply engaged at the roulette-table.

<p/>About this table fifty or sixty persons were assembled, many in the
outer rows, where there was occasionally a deposit of new-comers, being
mere spectators, only that one of them, usually a woman, might now and
then be observed putting down a five-franc with a simpering air, just
to see what the passion of gambling really was. Those who were taking
their pleasure at a higher strength, and were absorbed in play, showed
very distant varieties of European type: Livonian and Spanish,
Graeco-Italian and miscellaneous German, English aristocratic and
English plebeian. Here certainly was a striking admission of human
equality. The white bejewelled fingers of an English countess were very
near touching a bony, yellow, crab-like hand stretching a bared wrist
to clutch a heap of coin--a hand easy to sort with the square, gaunt
face, deep-set eyes, grizzled eyebrows, and ill-combed scanty hair
which seemed a slight metamorphosis of the vulture. And where else
would her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) ladyship have graciously consented to sit by that dry-lipped
feminine figure prematurely old, withered after short bloom like her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>)
artificial flowers, holding a shabby velvet reticule before her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>), and
occasionally putting in her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) mouth the point with which she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>)
card? There too, very near the fair countess, was a respectable London
tradesman, blonde and soft-handed, his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) sleek hair scrupulously parted
behind and before, conscious of circulars addressed to the nobility and
gentry, whose distinguished patronage enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) holidays
fashionably, and to a certain extent in their distinguished company.
Not his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) the gambler's passion that nullifies appetite, but a well-fed
leisure, which, in the intervals of winning money in business and
spending it showily, sees no better resource than winning money in play
and spending it yet more showily--reflecting always that Providence had
never manifested any disapprobation of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) amusement, and dispassionate
enough to leave off if the sweetness of winning much and seeing others
lose had turned to the sourness of losing much and seeing others win.
For the vice of gambling lay in losing money at it. In his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) bearing
there might be something of the tradesman, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) pleasures he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) was
fit to rank with the owners of the oldest titles. Standing close to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>)
chair was a handsome Italian, calm, statuesque, reaching across him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) to
place the first pile of napoleons from a new bagful just brought him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) by
an envoy with a scrolled mustache. The pile was in half a minute pushed
over to an old bewigged woman with eye-glasses pinching her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nose. There
was a slight gleam, a faint mumbling smile about the lips of the old
woman; but the statuesque Italian remained impassive, and--probably
secure in an infallible system which placed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) foot on the neck of
chance--immediately prepared a new pile. So did a man with the air of
an emaciated beau or worn-out libertine, who looked at life through one
eye-glass, and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) hand tremulously when he (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) asked for change.
It could surely be no severity of system, but rather some dream of
white crows, or the induction that the eighth of the month was lucky,
which inspired the fierce yet tottering impulsiveness of his (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) play.

<p/>But, while every single player differed markedly from every other,
there was a certain uniform negativeness of expression which had the
effect of a mask--as if they had all eaten of some root that for the
time compelled the brains of each to the same narrow monotony of action.

<p/>Deronda's first thought when his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes fell on this scene of dull,
gas-poisoned absorption, was that the gambling of Spanish shepherd-boys
had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) more enviable:--so far Rousseau might be justified in
maintaining that art and science had done a poor service to mankind.
But suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Rousseau</b></font>) felt the moment become dramatic. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rousseau</b></font>) attention was
arrested by a young lady who, standing at an angle not far from him (<font color='blue'><b>Rousseau</b></font>),
was the last to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Rousseau</b></font>) eyes traveled. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was bending and speaking
English to a middle-aged lady seated at play beside her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>): but the next
instant she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) play, and showed the full height of a
graceful figure, with a face which might possibly be looked at without
admiration, but could hardly be passed with indifference.

<p/>The inward debate which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) raised in Deronda gave to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes a
growing expression of scrutiny, tending farther and farther away from
the glow of mingled undefined sensibilities forming admiration. At one
moment they followed the movements of the figure, of the arms and
hands, as this problematic sylph bent forward to deposit her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stake with
an air of firm choice; and the next they returned to the face which, at
present unaffected by beholders, was directed steadily toward the game.
The sylph was a winner; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) taper fingers, delicately gloved in
pale-gray, were adjusting the coins which had been pushed toward her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in
order to pass them back again to the winning point, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked round
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with a survey too markedly cold and neutral not to have in it a
little of that nature which we call art concealing an inward exultation.

<p/>But in the course of that survey her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes met Deronda's, and instead of
averting them as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have desired to do, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was unpleasantly
conscious that they were arrested--how long? The darting sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
was measuring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and looking down on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as an inferior, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was of
different quality from the human dross around her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt himself
in a region outside and above her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and was examining her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as a specimen
of a lower order, roused a tingling resentment which stretched the
moment with conflict. It did not bring the blood to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cheeks, but it
sent it away from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) controlled herself by the help of an
inward defiance, and without other sign of emotion than this
lip-paleness turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) play. But Deronda's gaze seemed to have acted
as an evil eye. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stake was gone. No matter; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been winning ever
since she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took to roulette with a few napoleons at command, and had a
considerable reserve. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had begun to believe in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) luck, others had
begun to believe in it: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had visions of being followed by a _cortège_
who would worship her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as a goddess of luck and watch her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) play as a
directing augury. Such things had been known of male gamblers; why
should not a woman have a like supremacy? Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friend and chaperon who
had not wished her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to play at first was beginning to approve, only
administering the prudent advice to stop at the right moment and carry
money back to England--advice to which Gwendolen had replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
cared for the excitement of play, not the winnings. On that supposition
the present moment ought to have made the flood-tide in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eager
experience of gambling. Yet, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) next stake was swept away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
felt the orbits of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes getting hot, and the certainty she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
-LRB-without looking-RRB- of that man still watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was something like a
pressure which begins to be torturing. The more reason to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
should not flinch, but go on playing as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were indifferent to loss
or gain. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) friend touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) elbow and proposed that they should quit
the table. For reply Gwendolen put ten louis on the same spot: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
in that mood of defiance in which the mind loses sight of any end beyond
the satisfaction of enraged resistance; and with the puerile stupidity
of a dominant impulse includes luck among its objects of defiance. Since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not winning strikingly, the next best thing was to lose
strikingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) controlled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) muscles, and showed no tremor of mouth or
hands. Each time her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stake was swept off she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) doubled it. Many were now
watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), but the sole observation she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was conscious of was
Deronda's, who, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) never looked toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was sure had not
moved away. Such a drama takes no long while to play out: development
and catastrophe can often be measured by nothing clumsier than the
moment-hand. <div class="bookquote">``Faites votre jeu, mesdames et messieurs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the croupier</b></font>)</div>said the
automatic voice of destiny from between the mustache and imperial of the
croupier: and Gwendolen's arm was stretched to deposit her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) last poor
heap of napoleons. <div class="bookquote">``Le jeu ne va plus,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said destiny. And in five
seconds Gwendolen turned from the table, but turned resolutely with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
face toward Deronda and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). There was a smile of irony in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
eyes as their glances met; but it was at least better that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should
have kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) attention fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) disregarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as one
of an insect swarm who had no individual physiognomy. Besides, in spite
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) superciliousness and irony, it was difficult to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
did not admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spirit as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) person: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was young, handsome,
distinguished in appearance--not one of these ridiculous and dowdy
Philistines who thought it incumbent on them to blight the gaming-table
with a sour look of protest as they passed by it. The general conviction
that we are admirable does not easily give way before a single negative;
rather when any of Vanity's large family, male or female, find their
performance received coldly, they are apt to believe that a little more
of it will win over the unaccountable dissident. In Gwendolen's habits
of mind it had been taken for granted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew what was admirable
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) herself was admired. This basis of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thinking had
received a disagreeable concussion, and reeled a little, but was not
easily to be overthrown.

<p/>In the evening the same room was more stiflingly heated, was brilliant
with gas and with the costumes of ladies who floated their trains along
it or were seated on the ottomans.

<p/>The Nereid in sea-green robes and silver ornaments, with a pale
sea-green feather fastened in silver falling backward over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) green
hat and light brown hair, was Gwendolen Harleth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was under the
wing, or rather soared by the shoulder, of the lady who had sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
at the roulette-table; and with them was a gentleman with a white
mustache and clipped hair: solid-browed, stiff and German. They were
walking about or standing to chat with acquaintances, and Gwendolen was
much observed by the seated groups.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A striking girl--that Miss Harleth--unlike others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has got herself up as a sort of serpent now--all green and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are quite _comme il faut_. I have dined with them several times
at the _Russie_. The baroness is English. Miss Harleth calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>)

possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me! and the baron?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very good furniture picture.''

moving off to join the Langens.

<p/>The remark that Gwendolen wound her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck about more than usual this
evening was true. But it was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might carry out the serpent
idea more completely: it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) watched for any chance of seeing
Deronda, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might inquire about this stranger, under whose
measuring gaze she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was still wincing. At last her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) opportunity came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Vandernoodt, you know everybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, not too eagerly,
rather with a certain languor of utterance which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sometimes gave to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) clear soprano. <div class="bookquote">``Who is that near the door?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are half a dozen near the door. Do you mean that old Adonis in
the George the Fourth wig?''

expression.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dreadful, do you call it? I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an uncommonly fine fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is not like young men in general.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you don't admire young men in general?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least. I always know what they will say. I can't at all
guess what this Mr. Deronda would say. What _does_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, chiefly. I sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) party for a good hour last night on
the terrace, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) never spoke--and was not smoking either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked
bored.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another reason why I should like to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). I am always bored.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would be charmed to have an introduction. Shall I
bring it about? Will you allow it, baroness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?--since he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is related to Sir Hugo Mallinger. It is a new
_rôle_ of yours, Gwendolen, to be always bored,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame von Langen</b></font>)</div>continued Madame von
Langen, when Mr. Vandernoodt had moved away. <div class="bookquote">``Until now you have always
seemed eager about something from morning till night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is just because I am bored to death. If I am to leave off play I
must break my arm or my collar-bone. I must make something happen;
unless you will go into Switzerland and take me up the Matterhorn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps this Mr. Deronda's acquaintance will do instead of the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>But Gwendolen did not make Deronda's acquaintance on this occasion. Mr.
Vandernoodt did not succeed in bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Vandernoodt</b></font>) up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that evening, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) re-entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own room she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found a letter recalling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) home.




<p/>CHAPTER II.

<p/>This man contrives a secret `twixt us two,
That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may quell me with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meeting eyes
Like one who quells a lioness at bay.


<p/>This was the letter Gwendolen found on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) table:--

<p/>DEAREST CHILD.--I have been expecting to hear from you for a week. In
your last you said the Langens thought of leaving Leubronn and going
to Baden. How could you be so thoughtless as to leave me in
uncertainty about your address? I am in the greatest anxiety lest this
should not reach you. In any case, you were to come home at the end of
September, and I must now entreat you to return as quickly as
possible, for if you spent all your money it would be out of my power
to send you any more, and you must not borrow of the Langens, for I
could not repay them. This is the sad truth, my child--I wish I could
prepare you for it better--but a dreadful calamity has befallen us
all. You know nothing about business and will not understand it; but
Grapnell & Co. have failed for a million, and we are totally
ruined--your aunt Gascoigne as well as I, only that your uncle has his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
benefice, so that by putting down their carriage and getting interest
for the boys, the family can go on. All the property our poor father
saved for us goes to pay the liabilities. There is nothing I can call
my own. It is better you should know this at once, though it rends my
heart to have to tell it you. Of course we cannot help thinking what a
pity it was that you went away just when you did. But I shall never
reproach you, my dear child; I would save you from all trouble if I
could. On your way home you will have time to prepare yourself for the
change you will find. We shall perhaps leave Offendene at once, for we
hope that Mr. Haynes, who wanted it before, may be ready to take it
off my hands. Of course we cannot go to the rectory--there is not a
corner there to spare. We must get some hut or other to shelter us,
and we must live on your uncle Gascoigne's charity, until I see what
else can be done. I shall not be able to pay the debts to the
tradesmen besides the servants' wages. Summon up your fortitude, my
dear child; we must resign ourselves to God's will. But it is hard to
resign one's self to Mr. Lassman's wicked recklessness, which they say
was the cause of the failure. Your poor sisters can only cry with me
and give me no help. If you were once here, there might be a break in
the cloud--I always feel it impossible that you can have been meant
for poverty. If the Langens wish to remain abroad, perhaps you can put
yourself under some one else's care for the journey. But come as soon
as you can to your afflicted and loving mamma,

<p/>FANNY DAVILOW.

<p/>The first effect of this letter on Gwendolen was half-stupefying. The
implicit confidence that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) destiny must be one of luxurious ease,
where any trouble that occurred would be well clad and provided for,
had been stronger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own mind than in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's, being fed there
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) youthful blood and that sense of superior claims which made a
large part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consciousness. It was almost as difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to
believe suddenly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) position had become one of poverty and of
humiliating dependence, as it would have been to get into the strong
current of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) blooming life the chill sense that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) death would
really come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stood motionless for a few minutes, then tossed off
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hat and automatically looked in the glass. The coils of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) smooth
light-brown hair were still in order perfect enough for a ball-room;
and as on other nights, Gwendolen might have looked lingeringly at
herself for pleasure -LRB-surely an allowable indulgence-RRB-; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) took
no conscious note of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) reflected beauty, and simply stared right
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been jarred by a hateful sound and was waiting
for any sign of its cause. By-and-by she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) threw herself in the corner of
the red velvet sofa, took up the letter again and read it twice
deliberately, letting it at last fall on the ground, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rested
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) clasped hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lap and sat perfectly still, shedding no
tears. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) impulse was to survey and resist the situation rather than
to wail over it. There was no inward exclamation of <div class="bookquote">``Poor mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mamma had never seemed to get much enjoyment out of life, and if
Gwendolen had been at this moment disposed to feel pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have
bestowed it on herself--for was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) not naturally and rightfully the
chief object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's anxiety too? But it was anger, it was
resistance that possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); it was bitter vexation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had lost
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gains at roulette, whereas if her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) luck had continued through this
one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have had a handsome sum to carry home, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might
have gone on playing and won enough to support them all. Even now was
it not possible? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had only four napoleons left in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) purse, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
possessed some ornaments which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could sell: a practice so common in
stylish society at German baths that there was no need to be ashamed of
it; and even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not received her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would
probably have decided to get money for an Etruscan necklace which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
happened not to have been wearing since her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arrival; nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might
have done so with an agreeable sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was living with some
intensity and escaping humdrum. With ten louis at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) disposal and a
return of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) former luck, which seemed probable, what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) do
better than go on playing for a few days? If her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) friends at home
disapproved of the way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) got the money, as they certainly
would, still the money would be there. Gwendolen's imagination dwelt on
this course and created agreeable consequences, but not with unbroken
confidence and rising certainty as it would have done if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been
touched with the gambler's mania. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had gone to the roulette-table
not because of passion, but in search of it: her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind was still sanely
capable of picturing balanced probabilities, and while the chance of
winning allured her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), the chance of losing thrust itself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with
alternate strength and made a vision from which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pride sank
sensitively. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was resolved not to tell the Langens that any
misfortune had befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) family, or to make herself in any way
indebted to their compassion; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) jewelry
to any observable extent, they would interfere by inquiries and
remonstrances. The course that held the least risk of intolerable
annoyance was to raise money on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) necklace early in the morning, tell
the Langens that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) immediate return without giving
a reason, and take the train for Brussels that evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had no maid
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and the Langens might make difficulties about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) returning
home, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) will was peremptory.

<p/>Instead of going to bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) made as brilliant a light as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could and
began to pack, working diligently, though all the while visited by the
scenes that might take place on the coming day--now by the tiresome
explanations and farewells, and the whirling journey toward a changed
home, now by the alternative of staying just another day and standing
again at the roulette-table. But always in this latter scene there was
the presence of that Deronda, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with exasperating irony,
and--the two keen experiences were inevitably revived
together--beholding her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) again forsaken by luck. This importunate image
certainly helped to sway her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resolve on the side of immediate
departure, and to urge her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) packing to the point which would make a
change of mind inconvenient. It had struck twelve when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) came into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) room, and by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was assuring herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had left
out only what was necessary, the faint dawn was stealing through the
white blinds and dulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) candles. What was the use of going to bed?
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cold bath was refreshment enough, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw that a slight trace
of fatigue about the eyes only made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) look the more interesting.
Before six o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was completely equipped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gray traveling
dress even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt hat, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meant to walk out as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could count on seeing other ladies on their way to the springs. And
happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of mirror between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) two windows she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned to look at herself, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) elbow on the
back of the chair in an attitude that might have been chosen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without any
self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more
intense because one's own little core of egoistic sensibility is a
supreme care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
a _naïve_ delight in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fortunate self, which any but the harshest
saintliness will have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day
seen a pleasant reflection of that self in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends' flattery as
well as in the looking-glass. And even in this beginning of troubles,
while for lack of anything else to do she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) image in
the growing light, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face gathered a complacency gradual as the
cheerfulness of the morning. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beautiful lips curled into a more and
more decided smile, till at last she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hat, leaned forward
and kissed the cold glass which had looked so warm. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
believe in sorrow? If it attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt the force to crush it,
to defy it, or run away from it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had done already. Anything
seemed more possible than that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could go on bearing miseries, great
or small.

<p/>Madame von Langen never went out before breakfast, so that Gwendolen
could safely end her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) early walk by taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) way homeward through the
Obere Strasse in which was the needed shop, sure to be open after
seven. At that hour any observers whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) minded would be either on
their walks in the region of the springs, or would be still in their
bedrooms; but certainly there was one grand hotel, the _Czarina_ from
which eyes might follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) up to Mr. Wiener's door. This was a chance
to be risked: might she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) not be going in to buy something which had
struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fancy? This implicit falsehood passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) remembered that the _Czarina_ was Deronda's hotel; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was then
already far up the Obere Strasse, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) walked on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) usual
floating movement, every line in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) figure and drapery falling in
gentle curves attractive to all eyes except those which discerned in
them too close a resemblance to the serpent, and objected to the
revival of serpent-worship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked neither to the right hand nor to
the left, and transacted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) business in the shop with a coolness which
gave little Mr. Weiner nothing to remark except her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) proud grace of
manner, and the superior size and quality of the three central
turquoises in the necklace she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). They had belonged to a
chain once her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) father's: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never known her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) father; and the
necklace was in all respects the ornament she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could most conveniently
part with. Who supposes that it is an impossible contradiction to be
superstitious and rationalizing at the same time? Roulette encourages a
romantic superstition as to the chances of the game, and the most
prosaic rationalism as to human sentiments which stand in the way of
raising needful money. Gwendolen's dominant regret was that after all
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had only nine louis to add to the four in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) purse: these Jew
dealers were so unscrupulous in taking advantage of Christians
unfortunate at play! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was the Langens' guest in their hired
apartment, and had nothing to pay there: thirteen louis would do more
than take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) home; even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) determined on risking three, the
remaining ten would more than suffice, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meant to travel right
on, day and night. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned homeward, nay, entered and seated
herself in the _salon_ to await her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) friends and breakfast, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) still
wavered as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) immediate departure, or rather she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had concluded to
tell the Langens simply that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had had a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma
desiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) return, and to leave it still undecided when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should
start. It was already the usual breakfast-time, and hearing some one
enter as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was leaning back rather tired and hungry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes
shut, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rose expecting to see one or other of the Langens--the words
which might determine her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lingering at least another day, ready-formed
to pass her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips. But it was the servant bringing in a small packet for
Miss Harleth, which had at that moment been left at the door. Gwendolen
took it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand and immediately hurried into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
looked paler and more agitated than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had first read her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's
letter. Something--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) never quite knew what--revealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) opened the packet that it contained the necklace she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had just
parted with. Underneath the paper it was wrapped in a cambric
handkerchief, and within this was a scrap of torn-off note-paper, on
which was written with a pencil, in clear but rapid handwriting--<div class="bookquote">''_A
stranger who has found Miss Harleth's necklace returns it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) with
the hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) will not again risk the loss of it._''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen reddened with the vexation of wounded pride. A large corner
of the handkerchief seemed to have been recklessly torn off to get rid
of a mark; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) at once believed in the first image of <div class="bookquote">``the
stranger''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that presented itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind. It was Deronda; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) must
have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) go into the shop; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) must have gone in immediately after
and repurchased the necklace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had taken an unpardonable liberty, and
had dared to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in a thoroughly hateful position. What could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
do?--Not, assuredly, act on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) conviction that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) who had sent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) the necklace and straightway send it back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>): that would be to
face the possibility that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been mistaken; nay, even if the
<div class="bookquote">``stranger''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and no other, it would be something too gross for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had divined this, and to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) again
with that recognition in their minds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) knew very well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
entangling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in helpless humiliation: it was another way of smiling
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ironically, and taking the air of a supercilious mentor.
Gwendolen felt the bitter tears of mortification rising and rolling
down her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cheeks. No one had ever before dared to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with irony
and contempt. One thing was clear: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) must carry out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resolution to
quit this place at once; it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to reappear in the
public _salon_, still less stand at the gaming-table with the risk of
seeing Deronda. Now came an importunate knock at the door: breakfast
was ready. Gwendolen with a passionate movement thrust necklace,
cambric, scrap of paper, and all into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) _nécessaire_, pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
handkerchief against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face, and after pausing a minute or two to
summon back her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) proud self-control, went to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) friends. Such
signs of tears and fatigue as were left seemed accordant enough with
the account she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) at once gave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) having sat up to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) packing,
instead of waiting for help from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) friend's maid. There was much
protestation, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had expected, against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) traveling alone, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
persisted in refusing any arrangements for companionship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would be
put into the ladies' compartment and go right on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could rest
exceedingly well in the train, and was afraid of nothing.

<p/>In this way it happened that Gwendolen never reappeared at the
roulette-table, but that Thursday evening left Leubronn for Brussels,
and on Saturday morning arrived at Offendene, the home to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) family were soon to say a last good-bye.




<p/>CHAPTER III.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let no flower of the spring pass by us; let us crown ourselves with
rosebuds before they be withered.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--BOOK OF WISDOM.


<p/>Pity that Offendene was not the home of Miss Harleth's childhood, or
endeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) by family memories! A human life, I think, should be
well rooted in some spot of a native land, where it may get the love of
tender kinship for the face of earth, for the labors men go forth to,
for the sounds and accents that haunt it, for whatever will give that
early home a familiar unmistakable difference amid the future widening
of knowledge: a spot where the definiteness of early memories may be
inwrought with affection, and--kindly acquaintance with all neighbors,
even to the dogs and donkeys, may spread not by sentimental effort and
reflection, but as a sweet habit of the blood. At five years old,
mortals are not prepared to be citizens of the world, to be stimulated
by abstract nouns, to soar above preference into impartiality; and that
prejudice in favor of milk with which we blindly begin, is a type of
the way body and soul must get nourished at least for a time. The best
introduction to astronomy is to think of the nightly heavens as a
little lot of stars belonging to one's own homestead.

<p/>But this blessed persistence in which affection can take root had been
wanting in Gwendolen's life. It was only a year before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) recall from
Leubronn that Offendene had been chosen as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's home, simply for
its nearness to Pennicote Rectory, and that Mrs. Davilow, Gwendolen,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) four half-sisters -LRB-the governess and the maid following in
another vehicle-RRB- had been driven along the avenue for the first time,
on a late October afternoon when the rooks were crawing loudly above
them, and the yellow elm-leaves were whirling.

<p/>The season suited the aspect of the old oblong red-brick house, rather
too anxiously ornamented with stone at every line, not excepting the
double row of narrow windows and the large square portico. The stone
encouraged a greenish lichen, the brick a powdery gray, so that though
the building was rigidly rectangular there was no harshness in the
physiognomy which it turned to the three avenues cut east, west and
south in the hundred yards' breadth of old plantation encircling the
immediate grounds. One would have liked the house to have been lifted
on a knoll, so as to look beyond its own little domain to the long
thatched roofs of the distant villages, the church towers, the
scattered homesteads, the gradual rise of surging woods, and the green
breadths of undulating park which made the beautiful face of the earth
in that part of Wessex. But though standing thus behind a screen amid
flat pastures, it had on one side a glimpse of the wider world in the
lofty curves of the chalk downs, grand steadfast forms played over by
the changing days.

<p/>The house was but just large enough to be called a mansion, and was
moderately rented, having no manor attached to it, and being rather
difficult to let with its sombre furniture and faded upholstery. But
inside and outside it was what no beholder could suppose to be
inhabited by retired trades-people: a certainty which was worth many
conveniences to tenants who not only had the taste that shrinks from
new finery, but also were in that border-territory of rank where
annexation is a burning topic: and to take up her (<font color='blue'><b>tenants</b></font>) abode in a house
which had once sufficed for dowager countesses gave a perceptible tinge
to Mrs. Davilow's satisfaction in having an establishment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) own.
This, rather mysteriously to Gwendolen, appeared suddenly possible on
the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) step-father, Captain Davilow, who had for the last
nine years joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) family only in a brief and fitful manner, enough
to reconcile them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) long absences; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) cared much more for the
fact than for the explanation. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) prospects had become more
agreeable in consequence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had disliked their former way of life,
roving from one foreign watering-place or Parisian apartment to
another, always feeling new antipathies to new suites of hired
furniture, and meeting new people under conditions which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
appear of little importance; and the variation of having passed two
years at a showy school, where, on all occasions of display, she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had
been put foremost, had only deepened her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) sense that so exceptional a
person as herself could hardly remain in ordinary circumstances or in a
social position less than advantageous. Any fear of this latter evil
was banished now that her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) mamma was to have an establishment; for on
the point of birth Gwendolen was quite easy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had no notion how her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
maternal grandfather got the fortune inherited by his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) two daughters;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had been a West Indian--which seemed to exclude further
question; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) father's family was so high as to take
no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma, who nevertheless preserved with much pride the
miniature of a Lady Molly in that connection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would probably have
known much more about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father but for a little incident which
happened when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was twelve years old. Mrs. Davilow had brought out,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) did only at wide intervals, various memorials of her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) first
husband, and while showing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) miniature to Gwendolen recalled with a
fervor which seemed to count on a peculiar filial sympathy, the fact
that dear papa had died when his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) little daughter was in long clothes.
Gwendolen, immediately thinking of the unlovable step-father whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had been acquainted with the greater part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life while her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) frocks
were short, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you marry again, mamma? It would have been nicer if you had
not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow colored deeply, a slight convulsive movement passed over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) face, and straightway shutting up the memorials she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) said, with a
violence quite unusual in her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no feeling, child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen, who was fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma, felt hurt and ashamed, and had
never since dared to ask a question about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) father.

<p/>This was not the only instance in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had brought on herself the
pain of some filial compunction. It was always arranged, when possible,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should have a small bed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's room; for Mrs.
Davilow's motherly tenderness clung chiefly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) eldest girl, who had
been born in her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) happier time. One night under an attack of pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
found that the specific regularly placed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) bedside had been
forgotten, and begged Gwendolen to get out of bed and reach it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).
That healthy young lady, snug and warm as a rosy infant in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little
couch, objected to step out into the cold, and lying perfectly still,
grumbling a refusal. Mrs. Davilow went without the medicine and never
reproached her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) daughter; but the next day Gwendolen was keenly
conscious of what must be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's mind, and tried to make amends
by caresses which cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) no effort. Having always been the pet and
pride of the household, waited on by mother, sisters, governess and
maids, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been a princess in exile, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) naturally found it
difficult to think her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own pleasure less important than others made it,
and when it was positively thwarted felt an astonished resentment apt,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cruder days, to vent itself in one of those passionate acts
which look like a contradiction of habitual tendencies. Though never
even as a child thoughtlessly cruel, nay delighting to rescue drowning
insects and watch their recovery, there was a disagreeable silent
remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) having strangled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sister's canary-bird in a final
fit of exasperation at its shrill singing which had again and again
jarringly interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had taken pains to buy a white mouse
for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sister in retribution, and though inwardly excusing herself on
the ground of a peculiar sensitiveness which was a mark of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) general
superiority, the thought of that infelonious murder had always made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
wince. Gwendolen's nature was not remorseless, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) liked to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) penances easy, and now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was twenty and more, some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
native force had turned into a self-control by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) guarded
herself from penitential humiliation. There was more show of fire and
will in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) than ever, but there was more calculation underneath it.

<p/>On this day of arrival at Offendene, which not even Mrs. Davilow had
seen before--the place having been taken for her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) brother-in-law,
Mr. Gascoigne--when all had got down from the carriage, and were
standing under the porch in front of the open door, so that they could
have a general view of the place and a glimpse of the stone hall and
staircase hung with sombre pictures, but enlivened by a bright wood
fire, no one spoke; mamma, the four sisters and the governess all
looked at Gwendolen, as if their feelings depended entirely on her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
decision. Of the girls, from Alice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sixteenth year to Isabel in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tenth, hardly anything could be said on a first view, but that they
were girlish, and that their black dresses were getting shabby. Miss
Merry was elderly and altogether neutral in expression. Mrs. Davilow's
worn beauty seemed the more pathetic for the look of entire appeal
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) cast at Gwendolen, who was glancing round at the house, the
landscape and the entrance hall with an air of rapid judgment. Imagine
a young race-horse in the paddock among untrimmed ponies and patient
hacks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear, what do you think of the place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow at
last, in a gentle, deprecatory tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is charming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, quickly. <div class="bookquote">``A romantic place;
anything delightful may happen in it; it would be a good background for
anything. No one need be ashamed of living here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is certainly nothing common about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it would do for fallen royalty or any sort of grand poverty. We
ought properly to have been living in splendor, and have come down to
this. It would have been as romantic as could be. But I thought my
uncle and aunt Gascoigne would be here to meet us, and my cousin Anna,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>added Gwendolen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tone changed to sharp surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are early,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, and entering the hall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) said to
the housekeeper who came forward, <div class="bookquote">``You expect Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, madam; they were here yesterday to give particular orders about
the fires and the dinner. But as to fires, I've had 'em in all the
rooms for the last week, and everything is well aired. I could wish
some of the furniture paid better for all the cleaning it's had, but I
_think_ you'll see the brasses have been done justice to. I _think_
when Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne come, they'll tell you nothing has been
neglected. They'll be here at five, for certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>This satisfied Gwendolen, who was not prepared to have their arrival
treated with indifference; and after tripping a little way up the
matted stone staircase to take a survey there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tripped down again,
and followed by all the girls looked into each of the rooms opening
from the hall--the dining-room all dark oak and worn red satin damask,
with a copy of snarling, worrying dogs from Snyders over the
side-board, and a Christ breaking bread over the mantel-piece; the
library with a general aspect and smell of old brown-leather; and
lastly, the drawing-room, which was entered through a small antechamber
crowded with venerable knick-knacks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, mamma, pray come here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, Mrs. Davilow having
followed slowly in talk with the housekeeper. <div class="bookquote">``Here is an organ. I will
be Saint Cecilia: some one shall paint me as Saint Cecilia. Jocosa
-LRB-this was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cecilia</b></font>) name for Miss Merry-RRB-, let down my hair. See, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had thrown off her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) hat and gloves, and seated herself before the
organ in an admirable pose, looking upward; while the submissive and
sad Jocosa took out the one comb which fastened the coil of hair, and
then shook out the mass till it fell in a smooth light-brown stream far
below its owner's slim waist.

<p/>Mrs. Davilow smiled and said, <div class="bookquote">``A charming picture, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>not
indifferent to the display of her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) pet, even in the presence of a
housekeeper. Gwendolen rose and laughed with delight. All this seemed
quite to the purpose on entering a new house which was so excellent a
background.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a queer, quaint, picturesque room!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went on, looking about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I like these old embroidered chairs, and the garlands on the
wainscot, and the pictures that may be anything. That one with the
ribs--nothing but ribs and darkness--I should think that is Spanish,
mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gwendolen!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Isabel</b></font>)</div>said the small Isabel, in a tone of astonishment,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) held open a hinged panel of the wainscot at the other end of
the room.

<p/>Every one, Gwendolen first, went to look. The opened panel had
disclosed the picture of an upturned dead face, from which an obscure
figure seemed to be fleeing with outstretched arms. <div class="bookquote">``How horrible!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, with a look of mere disgust; but Gwendolen shuddered
silently, and Isabel, a plain and altogether inconvenient child with an
alarming memory, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will never stay in this room by yourself, Gwendolen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you open things which were meant to be shut up, you perverse
little creature?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) angriest tone. Then snatching
the panel out of the hand of the culprit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) closed it hastily,
saying, <div class="bookquote">``There is a lock--where is the key? Let the key be found, or
else let one be made, and let nobody open it again; or rather, let the
key be brought to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At this command to everybody in general Gwendolen turned with a face
which was flushed in reaction from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chill shudder, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Let us
go up to our own room, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>The housekeeper on searching found the key in the drawer of the cabinet
close by the panel, and presently handed it to Bugle, the lady's-maid,
telling her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) significantly to give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) Royal Highness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean, Mrs. Startin,''  (<font color='red'><b>a servant</b></font>)</div>said Bugle, who had been
busy up-stairs during the scene in the drawing-room, and was rather
offended at this irony in a new servant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean the young lady that's to command us all--and well worthy for
looks and figure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Startin</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Startin in propitiation. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Startin</b></font>)'ll know
what key it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have laid out what we want, go and see to the others, Bugle,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen had said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and Mrs. Davilow entered their black and
yellow bedroom, where a pretty little white couch was prepared by the
side of the black and yellow catafalque known as the best bed. <div class="bookquote">``I will
help mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) first movement was to go to the tall mirror between the
windows, which reflected herself and the room completely, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mamma sat down and also looked at the reflection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a becoming glass, Gwendolen; or is it the black and gold color
that sets you off?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, as Gwendolen stood obliquely
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) three-quarter face turned toward the mirror, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) left hand
brushing back the stream of hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should make a tolerable St. Cecilia with some white roses on my
head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,--<div class="bookquote">``only how about my nose, mamma? I think saint's
noses never in the least turn up. I wish you had given me your
perfectly straight nose; it would have done for any sort of
character--a nose of all work. Mine is only a happy nose; it would not
do so well for tragedy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, any nose will do to be miserable with in this world,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, with a deep, weary sigh, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) black bonnet
on the table, and resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) elbow near it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a strongly remonstrant tone, turning
away from the glass with an air of vexation, <div class="bookquote">``don't begin to be dull
here. It spoils all my pleasure, and everything may be so happy now.
What have you to be gloomy about _now_?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, seeming to rouse herself, and
beginning to take off her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) dress. <div class="bookquote">``It is always enough for me to see you
happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you should be happy yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, still
discontentedly, though going to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma with caressing touches.
<div class="bookquote">``Can nobody be happy after they are quite young? You have made me feel
sometimes as if nothing were of any use. With the girls so troublesome,
and Jocosa so dreadfully wooden and ugly, and everything make-shift
about us, and you looking so dull--what was the use of my being
anything? But now you _might_ be happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I shall, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, patting the cheek that was
bending near her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but really. Not with a sort of make-believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
with resolute perseverance. <div class="bookquote">``See what a hand and arm!--much more
beautiful than mine. Any one can see you were altogether more
beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, dear; I was always heavier. Never half so charming as you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but what is the use of my being charming, if it is to end in my
being dull and not minding anything? Is that what marriage always comes
to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, child, certainly not. Marriage is the only happy state for a
woman, as I trust you will prove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not put up with it if it is not a happy state. I am determined
to be happy--at least not to go on muddling away my life as other
people do, being and doing nothing remarkable. I have made up my mind
not to let other people interfere with me as they have done. Here is
some warm water ready for you, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen ended, proceeding to
take off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own dress and then waiting to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hair wound up by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma.

<p/>There was silence for a minute or two, till Mrs. Davilow said, while
coiling the daughter's hair, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I have never crossed you,
Gwendolen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You often want me to do what I don't like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean, to give Alice lessons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And I have done it because you asked me. But I don't see why I
should, else. It bores me to death, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is so slow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has no ear for
music, or language, or anything else. It would be much better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
to be ignorant, mamma: it is her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) _rôle_, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would do it well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a hard thing to say of your poor sister, Gwendolen, who is so
good to you, and waits on you hand and foot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why it is hard to call things by their right names, and
put them in their proper places. The hardship is for me to have to
waste my time on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Now let me fasten up your hair, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must make haste; your uncle and aunt will be here soon. For
heaven's sake, don't be scornful to _them_, my dear child! or to your
cousin Anna, whom you will always be going out with. Do promise me,
Gwendolen. You know, you can't expect Anna to be equal to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to be equal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head
and a smile, and the discussion ended there.

<p/>When Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne and their daughter came, Gwendolen, far
from being scornful, behaved as prettily as possible to them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
introducing herself anew to relatives who had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) since the
comparatively unfinished age of sixteen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was anxious--no, not
anxious, but resolved that they should admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Gascoigne bore a family likeness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) sister. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) was darker
and slighter, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) face was unworn by grief, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) movements were less
languid, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) expression more alert and critical as that of a rector's
wife bound to exert a beneficent authority. Their closest resemblance
lay in a non-resistant disposition, inclined to imitation and
obedience; but this, owing to the difference in their circumstances,
had led them to very different issues. The younger sister had been
indiscreet, or at least unfortunate in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) marriages; the elder
believed herself the most enviable of wives, and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) pliancy had ended
in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sometimes taking shapes of surprising definiteness. Many of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
opinions, such as those on church government and the character of
Archbishop Laud, seemed too decided under every alteration to have been
arrived at otherwise than by a wifely receptiveness. And there was much
to encourage trust in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband's authority. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had some agreeable
virtues, some striking advantages, and the failings that were imputed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) all leaned toward the side of success.

<p/>One of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) advantages was a fine person, which perhaps was even more
impressive at fifty-seven than it had been earlier in life. There were
no distinctively clerical lines in the face, no tricks of starchiness
or of affected ease: in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) Inverness cape he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not have been
identified except as a gentleman with handsome dark features, a nose
which began with an intention to be aquiline but suddenly became
straight, and iron-gray hair. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) owed this freedom from the
sort of professional make-up which penetrates skin, tones and gestures
and defies all drapery, to the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had once been Captain
Gaskin, having taken orders and a diphthong but shortly before his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
engagement to Miss Armyn. If any one had objected that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) preparation
for the clerical function was inadequate, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) friends might have asked
who made a better figure in it, who preached better or had more
authority in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) parish? He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had a native gift for administration, being
tolerant both of opinions and conduct, because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt himself able to
overrule them, and was free from the irritations of conscious
feebleness. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) smiled pleasantly at the foible of a taste which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did
not share--at floriculture or antiquarianism for example, which were
much in vogue among his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fellow-clergyman in the diocese: for himself,
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) preferred following the history of a campaign, or divining from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
knowledge of Nesselrode's motives what would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) conduct if
our cabinet had taken a different course. Mr. Gascoigne's tone of
thinking after some long-quieted fluctuations had become ecclesiastical
rather than theological; not the modern Anglican, but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) would
have called sound English, free from nonsense; such as became a man who
looked at a national religion by daylight, and saw it in its relation
to other things. No clerical magistrate had greater weight at sessions,
or less of mischievous impracticableness in relation to worldly
affairs. Indeed, the worst imputation thrown out against him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) was
worldliness: it could not be proved that he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) forsook the less fortunate,
but it was not to be denied that the friendships he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) cultivated were of
a kind likely to be useful to the father of six sons and two daughters;
and bitter observers--for in Wessex, say ten years ago, there were
persons whose bitterness may now seem incredible--remarked that the
color of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opinions had changed in consistency with this principle of
action. But cheerful, successful worldliness has a false air of being
more selfish than the acrid, unsuccessful kind, whose secret history is
summed up in the terrible words, <div class="bookquote">``Sold, but not paid for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen wondered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not better remembered how very fine a
man her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle was; but at the age of sixteen she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was a less capable and
more indifferent judge. At present it was a matter of extreme interest
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was to have the near countenance of a dignified male
relative, and that the family life would cease to be entirely,
insipidly feminine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not intend that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle should control
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw at once that it would be altogether agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) should be proud of introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) niece. And there was
every sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) being likely to feel that pride. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) certainly looked
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with admiration as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have outgrown Anna, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>putting his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) arm tenderly round his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
daughter, whose shy face was a tiny copy of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own, and drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
forward. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is not so old as you by a year, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) growing days are
certainly over. I hope you will be excellent companions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) did give a comparing glance at his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) daughter, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
inferiority, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) might also see that Anna's timid appearance and
miniature figure must appeal to a different taste from that which was
attracted by Gwendolen, and that the girls could hardly be rivals.
Gwendolen at least, was aware of this, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cousin with real
cordiality as well as grace, saying, <div class="bookquote">``A companion is just what I want.
I am so glad we are come to live here. And mamma will be much happier
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is near you, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin grace</b></font>)</div><p/>The aunt trusted indeed that it would be so, and felt it a blessing
that a suitable home had been vacant in their uncle's parish. Then, of
course, notice had to be taken of the four other girls, whom Gwendolen
had always felt to be superfluous: all of a girlish average that made
four units utterly unimportant, and yet from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) earliest days an
obtrusive influential fact in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was conscious of having
been much kinder to them than could have been expected. And it was
evident to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle and aunt also felt it a pity there were
so many girls:--what rational person could feel otherwise, except poor
mamma, who never would see how Alice set up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shoulders and lifted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyebrows till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had no forehead left, how Bertha and Fanny
whispered and tittered together about everything, or how Isabel was
always listening and staring and forgetting where she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) was, and treading
on the toes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) suffering elders?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have brothers, Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, while the sisters were being
noticed. <div class="bookquote">``I think you are enviable there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna, simply. <div class="bookquote">``I am very fond of them; but of course their
education is a great anxiety to papa. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) used to say they made me a
tomboy. I really was a great romp with Rex. I think you will like Rex.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) will come home before Christmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember I used to think you rather wild and shy; but it is
difficult now to imagine you a romp,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I am altered now; I am come out, and all that. But in
reality I like to go blackberrying with Edwy and Lotta as well as ever.
I am not very fond of going out; but I dare say I shall like it better
now you will be often with me. I am not at all clever, and I never know
what to say. It seems so useless to say what everybody knows, and I can
think of nothing else, except what papa says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall like going out with you very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, well
disposed toward this _naïve_ cousin. <div class="bookquote">``Are you fond of riding?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but we have only one Shetland pony amongst us. Papa says he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) can't
afford more, besides the carriage-horses and his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) own nag; he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) has so
many expenses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I intend to have a horse and ride a great deal now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
in a tone of decision. <div class="bookquote">``Is the society pleasant in this neighborhood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa says it is, very. There are the clergymen all about, you know;
and the Quallons, and the Arrowpoints, and Lord Brackenshaw, and Sir
Hugo Mallinger's place, where there is nobody--that's very nice,
because we make picnics there--and two or three families at Wanchester:
oh, and old Mrs. Vulcany, at Nuttingwood, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>But Anna was relieved of this tax on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) descriptive powers by the
announcement of dinner, and Gwendolen's question was soon indirectly
answered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle, who dwelt much on the advantages he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had secured
for them in getting a place like Offendene. Except the rent, it
involved no more expense than an ordinary house at Wanchester would
have done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it is always worth while to make a little sacrifice for a good
style of house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) easy, pleasantly confident
tone, which made the world in general seem a very manageable place of
residence: <div class="bookquote">``especially where there is only a lady at the head. All the
best people will call upon you; and you need give no expensive dinners.
Of course, I have to spend a good deal in that way; it is a large item.
But then I get my house for nothing. If I had to pay three hundred a
year for my house I could not keep a table. My boys are too great a
drain on me. You are better off than we are, in proportion; there is no
great drain on you now, after your house and carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you, Fanny, now that the children are growing up, I am
obliged to cut and contrive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne. <div class="bookquote">``I am not a good
manager by nature, but Henry has taught me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is wonderful for making
the best of everything; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) allows himself no extras, and gets his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
curates for nothing. It is rather hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has not been made a
prebendary or something, as others have been, considering the friends
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has made and the need there is for men of moderate opinions in all
respects. If the Church is to keep its position, ability and character
ought to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear Nancy, you forget the old story--thank Heaven, there are
three hundred as good as I. And ultimately, we shall have no reason to
complain, I am pretty sure. There could hardly be a more thorough
friend than Lord Brackenshaw--your landlord, you know, Fanny. Lady
Brackenshaw will call upon you. And I have spoken for Gwendolen to be a
member of our Archery Club--the Brackenshaw Archery Club--the most
select thing anywhere. That is, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) has no objection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>added Mr.
Gascoigne, looking at Gwendolen with pleasant irony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like it of all things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``There is nothing I
enjoy more than taking aim--and hitting,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ended, with a pretty nod
and smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our Anna, poor child, is too short-sighed for archery. But I consider
myself a first-rate shot, and you shall practice with me. I must make
you an accomplished archer before our great meeting in July. In fact,
as to neighborhood, you could hardly be better placed. There are the
Arrowpoints--they are some of our best people. Miss Arrowpoint is a
delightful girl--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been presented at Court. They have a
magnificent place--Quetcham Hall--worth seeing in point of art; and
their parties, to which you are sure to be invited, are the best things
of the sort we have. The archdeacon is intimate there, and they have
always a good kind of people staying in the house. Mrs. Arrowpoint is
peculiar, certainly; something of a caricature, in fact; but
well-meaning. And Miss Arrowpoint is as nice as possible. It is not all
young ladies who have mothers as handsome and graceful as yours and
Anna's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow smiled faintly at this little compliment, but the husband
and wife looked affectionately at each other, and Gwendolen thought,
<div class="bookquote">``My uncle and aunt, at least, are happy: they are not dull and dismal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Altogether, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) prospects at Offendene, as a
great improvement on anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had known. Even the cheap curates,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) incidentally learned, were almost always young men of family, and
Mr. Middleton, the actual curate, was said to be quite an acquisition:
it was only a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) was so soon to leave.

<p/>But there was one point which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was so anxious to gain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could
not allow the evening to pass without taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) measures toward
securing it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew, intended to submit entirely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
uncle's judgment with regard to expenditure; and the submission was not
merely prudential, for Mrs. Davilow, conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had always been
seen under a cloud as poor dear Fanny, who had made a sad blunder with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) second marriage, felt a hearty satisfaction in being frankly and
cordially identified with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister's family, and in having her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
affairs canvassed and managed with an authority which presupposed a
genuine interest. Thus the question of a suitable saddle-horse, which
had been sufficiently discussed with mamma, had to be referred to Mr.
Gascoigne; and after Gwendolen had played on the piano, which had been
provided from Wanchester, had sung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hearers' admiration, and had
induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in a duet--what more softening influence
than this on any uncle who would have sung finely if his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) time had not
been too much taken up by graver matters?--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seized the opportune
moment for saying, <div class="bookquote">``Mamma, you have not spoken to my uncle about my
riding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gwendolen desires above all things to have a horse to ride--a pretty,
light, lady's horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, looking at Mr. Gascoigne. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you think we can manage it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gascoigne projected his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) lower lip and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) handsome eyebrows
sarcastically at Gwendolen, who had seated herself with much grace on
the elbow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We could lend her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the pony sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne, watching
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) husband's face, and feeling quite ready to disapprove if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That might be inconveniencing others, aunt, and would be no pleasure
to me. I cannot endure ponies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather give up
some other indulgence and have a horse.''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady gentleman</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Was there ever a young lady
or gentleman not ready to give up an unspecified indulgence for the
sake of the favorite one specified?-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) rides so well. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has had lessons, and the riding-master said she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
had so good a seat and hand she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) might be trusted with any mount,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Davilow, who, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had not wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) darling to have the
horse, would not have dared to be lukewarm in trying to get it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is the price of the horse--a good sixty with the best chance,
and then his (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) keep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, in a tone which, though
demurring, betrayed the inward presence of something that favored the
demand. <div class="bookquote">``There are the carriage-horses--already a heavy item. And
remember what you ladies cost in toilet now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really wear nothing but two black dresses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow,
hastily. <div class="bookquote">``And the younger girls, of course, require no toilet at
present. Besides, Gwendolen will save me so much by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sisters
lessons.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>Here Mrs. Davilow's delicate cheek showed a rapid blush. <div class="bookquote">``If
it were not for that, I must really have a more expensive governess,
and masters besides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen felt some anger with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma, but carefully concealed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is good--that is decidedly good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, heartily,
looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) wife. And Gwendolen, who, it must be owned, was a deep
young lady, suddenly moved away to the other end of the long
drawing-room, and busied herself with arranging pieces of music.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dear child has had no indulgences, no pleasures,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Davilow, in a pleading undertone. <div class="bookquote">``I feel the expense is rather
imprudent in this first year of our settling. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) really needs the
exercise--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) needs cheering. And if you were to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) on horseback,
it is something splendid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is what we could not afford for Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne. <div class="bookquote">``But

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Anna was absorbed in a game with Isabel, who had hunted out an old
back-gammon-board, and had begged to sit up an extra hour.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, a fine woman never looks better than on horseback,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Gascoigne. <div class="bookquote">``And Gwendolen has the figure for it. I don't say the
thing should not be considered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We might try it for a time, at all events. It can be given up, if
necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I will consult Lord Brackenshaw's head groom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) is my _fidus

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, much relieved. <div class="bookquote">``You are very kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) always is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne. And later that night, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) husband were in private, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were almost too indulgent about the horse for Gwendolen.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ought not to claim so much more than your own daughter would think
of. Especially before we see how Fanny manages on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) income. And you
really have enough to do without taking all this trouble on yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Nancy, one must look at things from every point of view. This
girl is really worth some expense: you don't often see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) equal. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
ought to make a first-rate marriage, and I should not be doing my duty
if I spared my trouble in helping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forward. You know yourself she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
has been under a disadvantage with such a father-in-law, and a second
family, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always in the shade. I feel for the girl, And I
should like your sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) family now to have the benefit of your
having married rather a better specimen of our kind than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather better! I should think so. However, it is for me to be grateful
that you will take so much on your shoulders for the sake of my sister
and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) children. I am sure I would not grudge anything to poor Fanny.
But there is one thing I have been thinking of, though you have never
mentioned it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The boys. I hope they will not be falling in love with Gwendolen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't presuppose anything of the kind, my dear, and there will be no
danger. Rex will never be at home for long together, and Warham is
going to India. It is the wiser plan to take it for granted that
cousins will not fall in love. If you begin with precautions, the
affair will come in spite of them. One must not undertake to act for
Providence in these matters, which can no more be held under the hand
than a brood of chickens. The boys will have nothing, and Gwendolen
will have nothing. They can't marry. At the worst there would only be a
little crying, and you can't save boys and girls from that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gascoigne's mind was satisfied: if anything did happen, there was
the comfort of feeling that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) husband would know what was to be done,
and would have the energy to do it.

<p/>It would be a little hard to blame the rector of Pennicote that in the
course of looking at things from every point of view, he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) looked at
Gwendolen as a girl likely to make a brilliant marriage. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>)
be expected to differ from his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) contemporaries in this matter, and wish
his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) niece a worse end of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) charming maidenhood than they would
approve as the best possible? It is rather to be set down to his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) credit
that his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) feelings on the subject were entirely good-natured. And in
considering the relation of means to ends, it would have been mere
folly to have been guided by the exceptional and idyllic--to have
recommended that Gwendolen should wear a gown as shabby as Griselda's
in order that a marquis might fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), or to have
insisted that since a fair maiden was to be sought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should keep
herself out of the way. Mr. Gascoigne's calculations were of the kind
called rational, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) did not even think of getting a too frisky
horse in order that Gwendolen might be threatened with an accident and
be rescued by a man of property. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) niece well, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant
her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to be seen to advantage in the best society of the neighborhood.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) uncle's intention fell in perfectly with Gwendolen's own wishes.
But let no one suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) also contemplated a brilliant marriage
as the direct end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) witching the world with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) grace on
horseback, or with any other accomplishment. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was to be married
some time or other she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have felt obliged to admit; and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
marriage would not be of a middling kind, such as most girls were
contented with, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt quietly, unargumentatively sure. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
thoughts never dwelt on marriage as the fulfillment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ambition;
the dramas in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagined herself a heroine were not wrought up
to that close. To be very much sued or hopelessly sighed for as a bride
was indeed an indispensable and agreeable guarantee of womanly power;
but to become a wife and wear all the domestic fetters of that
condition, was on the whole a vexatious necessity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) observation of
matrimony had inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to think it rather a dreary state in which a
woman could not do what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liked, had more children than were
desirable, was consequently dull, and became irrevocably immersed in
humdrum. Of course marriage was social promotion; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not look
forward to a single life; but promotions have sometimes to be taken
with bitter herbs--a peerage will not quite do instead of leadership to
the man who meant to lead; and this delicate-limbed sylph of twenty
meant to lead. For such passions dwell in feminine breasts also. In
Gwendolen's, however, they dwelt among strictly feminine furniture, and
had no disturbing reference to the advancement of learning or the
balance of the constitution; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knowledge being such as with no sort
of standing-room or length of lever could have been expected to move
the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meant to do what was pleasant to herself in a striking
manner; or rather, whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could do so as to strike others with
admiration and get in that reflected way a more ardent sense of living,
seemed pleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gwendolen will not rest without having the world at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Merry governess words</b></font>)</div>said
Miss Merry, the meek governess: hyperbolical words which have long come
to carry the most moderate meanings; for who has not heard of private
persons having the world at their feet in the shape of some half-dozen
items of flattering regard generally known in a genteel suburb? And
words could hardly be too wide or vague to indicate the prospect that
made a hazy largeness about poor Gwendolen on the heights of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) young
self-exultation. Other people allowed themselves to be made slaves of,
and to have their lives blown hither and thither like empty ships in
which no will was present. It was not to be so with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would no
longer be sacrificed to creatures worth less than herself, but would
make the very best of the chances that life offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and conquer
circumstances by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) exceptional cleverness. Certainly, to be settled
at Offendene, with the notice of Lady Brackenshaw, the archery club,
and invitations to dine with the Arrowpoints, as the highest lights in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) scenery, was not a position that seemed to offer remarkable
chances; but Gwendolen's confidence lay chiefly in herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt
well equipped for the mastery of life. With regard to much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lot
hitherto, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) held herself rather hardly dealt with, but as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``education,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have admitted that it had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) under no
disadvantages. In the school-room her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) quick mind had taken readily that
strong starch of unexplained rules and disconnected facts which saves
ignorance from any painful sense of limpness; and what remained of all
things knowable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was conscious of being sufficiently acquainted
with through novels, plays and poems. About her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) French and music, the
two justifying accomplishments of a young lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt no ground for
uneasiness; and when to all these qualifications, negative and
positive, we add the spontaneous sense of capability some happy persons
are born with, so that any subject they turn their attention to
impresses them with their own power of forming a correct judgment on
it, who can wonder if Gwendolen felt ready to manage her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own destiny?

<p/>There were many subjects in the world--perhaps the majority--in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt no interest, because they were stupid; for subjects are apt to
appear stupid to the young as light seems dull to the old; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
would not have felt at all helpless in relation to them if they had
turned up in conversation. It must be remembered that no one had
disputed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power or her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) general superiority. As on the arrival at
Offendene, so always, the first thought of those about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been,
what will Gwendolen think?--if the footman trod heavily in creaking
boots, or if the laundress's work was unsatisfactory, the maid said,
<div class="bookquote">``This will never do for Miss Harleth'' (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>; if the wood smoked in the
bedroom fireplace, Mrs. Davilow, whose own weak eyes suffered much from
this inconvenience, spoke apologetically of it to Gwendolen. If, when
they were under the stress of traveling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not appear at the
breakfast table till every one else had finished, the only question
was, how Gwendolen's coffee and toast should still be of the hottest
and crispest; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) appeared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) freshly-brushed
light-brown hair streaming backward and awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's hand to
coil it up, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) large brown eyes glancing bright as a wave-washed onyx
from under their long lashes, it was always she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) herself who had to be
tolerant--to beg that Alice who sat waiting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would not stick up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shoulders in that frightful manner, and that Isabel, instead of
pushing up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) and asking questions, would go away to Miss Merry.

<p/>Always she (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) was the princess in exile, who in time of famine was to have
her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) breakfast-roll made of the finest-bolted flour from the seven thin
ears of wheat, and in a general decampment was to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) silver fork
kept out of the baggage. How was this to be accounted for? The answer
may seem to lie quite on the surface:--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) beauty, a certain
unusualness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>), a decision of will which made itself felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>)
graceful movements and clear unhesitating tones, so that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) came
into the room on a rainy day when everybody else was flaccid and the
use of things in general was not apparent to them, there seemed to be a
sudden, sufficient reason for keeping up the forms of life; and even
the waiters at hotels showed the more alacrity in doing away with
crumbs and creases and dregs with struggling flies in them. This potent
charm, added to the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) was the eldest daughter, toward whom
her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) mamma had always been in an apologetic state of mind for the evils
brought on her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) by a step-father, may seem so full a reason for
Gwendolen's domestic empire, that to look for any other would be to ask
the reason of daylight when the sun is shining. But beware of arriving
at conclusions without comparison. I remember having seen the same
assiduous, apologetic attention awarded to persons who were not at all
beautiful or unusual, whose firmness showed itself in no very graceful
or euphonious way, and who were not eldest daughters with a tender,
timid mother, compunctious at having subjected them to inconveniences.
Some of them were a very common sort of men. And the only point of
resemblance among them all was a strong determination to have what was
pleasant, with a total fearlessness in making themselves disagreeable
or dangerous when they did not get it. Who is so much cajoled and
served with trembling by the weak females of a household as the
unscrupulous male--capable, if he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) has not free way at home, of going
and doing worse elsewhere? Hence I am forced to doubt whether even
without her (<font color='blue'><b>females</b></font>) potent charm and peculiar filial position Gwendolen might
not still have played the queen in exile, if only she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
inborn energy of egoistic desire, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power of inspiring fear as to
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might say or do. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had the charm, and those who
feared her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were also fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); the fear and the fondness being
perhaps both heightened by what may be called the iridescence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
character--the play of various, nay, contrary tendencies. For Macbeth's
rhetoric about the impossibility of being many opposite things in the
same moment, referred to the clumsy necessities of action and not to
the subtler possibilities of feeling. We cannot speak a loyal word and
be meanly silent; we cannot kill and not kill in the same moment; but a
moment is wide enough for the loyal and mean desire, for the outlash of
a murderous thought and the sharp backward stroke of repentance.




<p/>CHAPTER V.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wit
Values itself so highly, that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
All matter else seems weak.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--_Much Ado About Nothing._


<p/>Gwendolen's reception in the neighborhood fulfilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle's
expectations. From Brackenshaw Castle to the Firs at Wanchester, where
Mr. Quallon the banker kept a generous house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was welcomed with
manifest admiration, and even those ladies who did not quite like her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
felt a comfort in having a new, striking girl to invite; for hostesses
who entertain much must make up their parties as ministers make up
their cabinets, on grounds other than personal liking. Then, in order
to have Gwendolen as a guest, it was not necessary to ask any one who
was disagreeable, for Mrs. Davilow always made a quiet, picturesque
figure as a chaperon, and Mr. Gascoigne was everywhere in request for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) own sake.

<p/>Among the houses where Gwendolen was not quite liked, and yet invited,
was Quetcham Hall. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) first invitations was to a large
dinner-party there, which made a sort of general introduction for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
to the society of the neighborhood; for in a select party of thirty and
of well-composed proportions as to age, few visitable families could be
entirely left out. No youthful figure there was comparable to
Gwendolen's as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) passed through the long suite of rooms adorned with
light and flowers, and, visible at first as a slim figure floating
along in white drapery, approached through one wide doorway after
another into fuller illumination and definiteness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never had
that sort of promenade before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt exultingly that it befitted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): any one looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) for the first time might have supposed that
long galleries and lackeys had always been a matter of course in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
life; while her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cousin Anna, who was really more familiar with these
things, felt almost as much embarrassed as a rabbit suddenly deposited
in that well-lit-space.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that with Gascoigne?''  (<font color='red'><b>the archdeacon</b></font>)</div>said the archdeacon, neglecting a
discussion of military manoeuvres on which, as a clergyman, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was
naturally appealed to. And his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) son, on the other side of the room--a
hopeful young scholar, who had already suggested some <div class="bookquote">``not less elegant
than ingenious,''  (<font color='red'><b>a scholar</b></font>)</div>emendations of Greek texts--said nearly at the same
time, <div class="bookquote">``By George! who is that girl with the awfully well-set head and
jolly figure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a scholar</b></font>)</div><p/>But to a mind of general benevolence, wishing everybody to look well,
it was rather exasperating to see how Gwendolen eclipsed others: how
even the handsome Miss Lawe, explained to be the daughter of Lady Lawe,
looked suddenly broad, heavy and inanimate; and how Miss Arrowpoint,
unfortunately also dressed in white, immediately resembled a
_carte-de-visite_ in which one would fancy the skirt alone to have been
charged for. Since Miss Arrowpoint was generally liked for the amiable
unpretending way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) fortunes, and made a softening
screen for the oddities of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) mother, there seemed to be some
unfitness in Gwendolen's looking so much more like a person of social
importance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not really so handsome if you come to examine her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) features,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint, later in the evening, confidentially to Mrs.
Vulcany. <div class="bookquote">``It is a certain style she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has, which produces a great effect
at first, but afterward she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is less agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>In fact, Gwendolen, not intending it, but intending the contrary, had
offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hostess, who, though not a splenetic or vindictive woman,
had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) susceptibilities. Several conditions had met in the Lady of
Quetcham which to the reasoners in that neighborhood seemed to have an
essential connection with each other. It was occasionally recalled that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been the heiress of a fortune gained by some moist or dry
business in the city, in order fully to account for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) having a squat
figure, a harsh parrot-like voice, and a systematically high
head-dress; and since these points made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) externally rather
ridiculous, it appeared to many only natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should have what
are called literary tendencies. A little comparison would have shown
that all these points are to be found apart; daughters of aldermen
being often well-grown and well-featured, pretty women having sometimes
harsh or husky voices, and the production of feeble literature being
found compatible with the most diverse forms of _physique_, masculine
as well as feminine.

<p/>Gwendolen, who had a keen sense of absurdity in others, but was kindly
disposed toward any one who could make life agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), meant to
win Mrs. Arrowpoint by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) an interest and attention beyond what
others were probably inclined to show. But self-confidence is apt to
address itself to an imaginary dullness in others; as people who are
well off speak in a cajoling tone to the poor, and those who are in the
prime of life raise their voice and talk artificially to seniors,
hastily conceiving them to be deaf and rather imbecile. Gwendolen, with
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cleverness and purpose to be agreeable, could not escape that
form of stupidity: it followed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind, unreflectingly, that
because Mrs. Arrowpoint was ridiculous she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) was also likely to be
wanting in penetration, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) went through her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) little scenes without
suspicion that the various shades of her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) behavior were all noted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are fond of books as well as of music, riding, and archery, I
hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Arrowpoint said, going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) for a _tete-à-tete_ in the
drawing-room after dinner. <div class="bookquote">``Catherine will be very glad to have so
sympathetic a neighbor.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This little speech might have seemed the most
graceful politeness, spoken in a low, melodious tone; but with a twang,
fatally loud, it gave Gwendolen a sense of exercising patronage when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) answered, gracefully:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is I who am fortunate. Miss Arrowpoint will teach me what good
music is. I shall be entirely a learner. I hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is a thorough
musician.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine has certainly had every advantage. We have a first-rate
musician in the house now--Herr Klesmer; perhaps you know all his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
compositions. You must allow me to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) to you. You sing, I
believe. Catherine plays three instruments, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) does not sing. I
hope you will let us hear you. I understand you are an accomplished
singer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!--`die Kraft ist schwach, allein die Lust ist gross,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mephistopheles</b></font>)</div>as
Mephistopheles says.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are a student of Goethe. Young ladies are so advanced now. I
suppose you have read everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, really. I shall be so glad if you will tell me what to read. I
have been looking into all the books in the library at Offendene, but
there is nothing readable. The leaves all stick together and smell
musty. I wish I could write books to amuse myself, as you can! How
delightful it must be to write books after one's own taste instead of
reading other people's! Home-made books must be so nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div><p/>For an instant Mrs. Arrowpoint's glance was a little sharper, but the
perilous resemblance to satire in the last sentence took the hue of
girlish simplicity when Gwendolen added--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would give anything to write a book!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why should you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint, encouragingly. <div class="bookquote">``You
have but to begin as I did. Pen, ink, and paper are at everybody's
command. But I will send you all I have written with pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks. I shall be so glad to read your writings. Being acquainted
with authors must give a peculiar understanding of their books: one
would be able to tell then which parts were funny and which serious. I
am sure I often laugh in the wrong place.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Here Gwendolen herself
became aware of danger, and added quickly, <div class="bookquote">``In Shakespeare, you know,
and other great writers that we can never see. But I always want to
know more than there is in the books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are interested in any of my subjects I can lend you many extra
sheets in manuscript,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint--while Gwendolen felt
herself painfully in the position of the young lady who professed to
like potted sprats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are things I dare say I shall publish eventually: several
friends have urged me to do so, and one doesn't like to be obstinate.
My Tasso, for example--I could have made it twice the size.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dote on Tasso,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you shall have all my papers, if you like. So many, you know,
have written about Tasso; but they are all wrong. As to the particular
nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) madness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) feelings for Leonora, and the real cause
of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) imprisonment, and the character of Leonora, who, in my opinion,
was a cold-hearted woman, else she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have married him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in spite of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother--they are all wrong. I differ from everybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very interesting!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I like to differ from
everybody. I think it is so stupid to agree. That is the worst of
writing your opinions; you make people agree with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>This speech
renewed a slight suspicion in Mrs. Arrowpoint, and again her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) glance
became for a moment examining. But Gwendolen looked very innocent, and
continued with a docile air:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of Tasso except the _Gerusalemme Liberata_, which we
read and learned by heart at school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) life is more interesting than his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) poetry, I have constructed
the early part of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) life as a sort of romance. When one thinks of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
father Bernardo, and so on, there is much that must be true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Imagination is often truer than fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, decisively,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could no more have explained these glib words than if they
had been Coptic or Etruscan. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be so glad to learn all about
Tasso--and his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) madness especially. I suppose poets are always a little
mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``To be sure--`the poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling'; and somebody
says of Marlowe--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For that fine madness still he (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>) did maintain,
Which always should possess the poet's brain.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was not always found out, was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen innocently.
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose some of them rolled their eyes in private. Mad people are
often very cunning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div><p/>Again a shade flitted over Mrs. Arrowpoint's face; but the entrance of
the gentlemen prevented any immediate mischief between her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) and this too
quick young lady, who had over-acted her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) _naïveté_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, here comes Herr Klesmer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint, rising; and
presently bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) to Gwendolen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) left them to a dialogue which
was agreeable on both sides, Herr Klesmer being a felicitous
combination of the German, the Sclave and the Semite, with grand
features, brown hair floating in artistic fashion, and brown eyes in
spectacles. His (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) English had little foreignness except its fluency; and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) alarming cleverness was made less formidable just then by a certain
softening air of silliness which will sometimes befall even Genius in
the desire of being agreeable to Beauty.

<p/>Music was soon begun. Miss Arrowpoint and Herr Klesmer played a
four-handed piece on two pianos, which convinced the company in general
that it was long, and Gwendolen in particular that the neutral,
placid-faced Miss Arrowpoint had a mastery of the instrument which put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) own execution out of question--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) was not discouraged as to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) often-praised touch and style. After this every one became anxious
to hear Gwendolen sing; especially Mr. Arrowpoint; as was natural in a
host and a perfect gentleman, of whom no one had anything to say but
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) married Miss Cuttler and imported the best cigars; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) led
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to the piano with easy politeness. Herr Klesmer closed the
instrument in readiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and smiled with pleasure at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
approach; then placed himself at a distance of a few feet so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sang.

<p/>Gwendolen was not nervous; what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) undertook to do she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did without
trembling, and singing was an enjoyment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) voice was a
moderately powerful soprano -LRB-some one had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) it was like Jenny
Lind's-RRB-, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ear good, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was able to keep in tune, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
singing gave pleasure to ordinary hearers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been used to
unmingled applause. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had the rare advantage of looking almost
prettier when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was singing than at other times, and that Herr
Klesmer was in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seemed not disagreeable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) song,
determined on beforehand, was a favorite aria of Belini's, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
felt quite sure of herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charming?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Arrowpoint, who had remained near, and the word
was echoed around without more insincerity than we recognize in a
brotherly way as human. But Herr Klesmer stood like a statue--if a
statue can be imagined in spectacles; at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) was as mute as a
statue. Gwendolen was pressed to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seat and double the general
pleasure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not wish to refuse; but before resolving to do
so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) moved a little toward Herr Klesmer, saying with a look of
smiling appeal, <div class="bookquote">``It would be too cruel to a great musician. You cannot
like to hear poor amateur singing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, truly; but that makes nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Herr Klesmer, suddenly
speaking in an odious German fashion with staccato endings, quite
unobservable in him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) before, and apparently depending on a change of
mood, as Irishmen resume their strongest brogue when they are fervid or
quarrelsome. <div class="bookquote">``That makes nothing. It is always acceptable to see you
sing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Was there ever so unexpected an assertion of superiority? at least
before the late Teutonic conquest? Gwendolen colored deeply, but, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) usual presence of mind, did not show an ungraceful resentment by
moving away immediately; and Miss Arrowpoint, who had been near enough
to overhear -LRB-and also to observe that Herr Klesmer's mode of looking at
Gwendolen was more conspicuously admiring than was quite consistent
with good taste-RRB-, now with the utmost tact and kindness came close to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Imagine what I have to go through with this professor! He (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) can hardly
tolerate anything we English do in music. We can only put up with his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>)
severity, and make use of it to find out the worst that can be said of
us. It is a little comfort to know that; and one can bear it when every
one else is admiring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) for telling me the worst,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, recovering herself. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say I have been extremely ill
taught, in addition to having no talent--only liking for music.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This
was very well expressed considering that it had never entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind
before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is true: you have not been well taught,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Herr Klesmer,
quietly. Woman was dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>), but music was dearer. <div class="bookquote">``Still, you are
not quite without gifts. You sing in tune, and you have a pretty fair
organ. But you produce your notes badly; and that music which you sing
is beneath you. It is a form of melody which expresses a puerile state
of culture--a dawdling, canting, see-saw kind of stuff--the passion and
thought of people without any breadth of horizon. There is a sort of
self-satisfied folly about every phrase of such melody; no cries of
deep, mysterious passion--no conflict--no sense of the universal. It
makes men small as they listen to it. Sing now something larger. And I
shall see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not now--by-and-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a sinking of heart at
the sudden width of horizon opened round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) small musical performance.
For a lady desiring to lead, this first encounter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) campaign was
startling. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was bent on not behaving foolishly, and Miss
Arrowpoint helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) by saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, by-and-by. I always require half an hour to get up my courage
after being criticised by Herr Klesmer. We will ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) to play to us
now: he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) is bound to show us what is good music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div><p/>To be quite safe on this point Herr Klesmer played a composition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
own, a fantasia called _Freudvoll, Leidvoll, Gedankenvoll_--an
extensive commentary on some melodic ideas not too grossly evident; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) certainly fetched as much variety and depth of passion out of the
piano as that moderately responsive instrument lends itself to, having
an imperious magic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) fingers that seem to send a nerve-thrill
through ivory key and wooden hammer, and compel the strings to make a
quivering lingering speech for him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>). Gwendolen, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wounded
egoism, had fullness of nature enough to feel the power of this
playing, and it gradually turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) inward sob of mortification into
an excitement which lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) for the moment into a desperate
indifference about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own doings, or at least a determination to get a
superiority over them by laughing at them as if they belonged to
somebody else. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes had become brighter, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cheeks slightly
flushed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tongue ready for any mischievous remarks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would sing to us again, Miss Harleth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clintock/Mr. Clintock</b></font>)</div>said young Clintock,
the archdeacon's classical son, who had been so fortunate as to take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to dinner, and came up to renew conversation as soon as Herr
Klesmer's performance was ended, <div class="bookquote">``That is the style of music for me. I
never can make anything of this tip-top playing. It is like a jar of
leeches, where you can never tell either beginnings or endings. I could
listen to your singing all day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we should be glad of something popular now--another song from you
would be a relaxation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint, who had also come near
with polite intentions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That must be because you are in a puerile state of culture, and have
no breadth of horizon. I have just learned that. I have been taught how
bad my taste is, and am feeling growing pains. They are never
pleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, not taking any notice of Mrs. Arrowpoint,
and looking up with a bright smile at young Clintock.

<p/>Mrs. Arrowpoint was not insensible to this rudeness, but merely said,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, we will not press anything disagreeably,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>and as there was a
perceptible outburst of imprisoned conversation just then, and a
movement of guests seeking each other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) remained seated where she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>)
was, and looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) with the relief of a hostess at finding she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>)
is not needed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you like this neighborhood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clintock/Mr. Clintock</b></font>)</div>said young Clintock,
well-pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clintock</b></font>) station in front of Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exceedingly. There seems to be a little of everything and not much of
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is rather equivocal praise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not with me. I like a little of everything; a little absurdity, for
example, is very amusing. I am thankful for a few queer people; but
much of them is a bore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Mrs. Arrowpoint, who was hearing this dialogue, perceived quite a new
tone in Gwendolen's speech, and felt a revival of doubt as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
interest in Tasso's madness.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think there should be more croquet, for one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clintock/Mr. Clintock</b></font>)</div>young Clintock;
<div class="bookquote">``I am usually away, but if I were more here I should go in for a
croquet club. You are one of the archers, I think. But depend upon it
croquet is the game of the future. It wants writing up, though. One of
our best men has written a poem on it, in four cantos;--as good as
Pope. I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) to publish it--You never read anything better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clintock/Mr. Clintock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall study croquet to-morrow. I shall take to it instead of
singing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, not that; but do take to croquet. I will send you Jenning's
poem if you like. I have a manuscript copy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) a great friend of yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, rather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) is only rather, I think I will decline. Or, if you send it
to me, will you promise not to catechise me upon it and ask me which
part I like best? Because it is not so easy to know a poem without
reading it as to know a sermon without listening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Arrowpoint thought, <div class="bookquote">``this girl is double and
satirical. I shall be on my guard against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div><p/>But Gwendolen, nevertheless, continued to receive polite attentions
from the family at Quetcham, not merely because invitations have larger
grounds than those of personal liking, but because the trying little
scene at the piano had awakened a kindly solicitude toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) in the
gentle mind of Miss Arrowpoint, who managed all the invitations and
visits, her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) mother being otherwise occupied.




<p/>CHAPTER VI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Croyez-vous m`avoir humiliée pour m`avoir appris que la terre tourne
autour du soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m`en estime pas moins.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--FONTENELLE: _Pluralité des Mondes_.


<p/>That lofty criticism had caused Gwendolen a new sort of pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would
not have chosen to confess how unfortunate she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought herself in not
having had Miss Arrowpoint's musical advantages, so as to be able to
question Herr Klesmer's taste with the confidence of thorough
knowledge; still less, to admit even to herself that Miss Arrowpoint
each time they met raised an unwonted feeling of jealousy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): not
in the least because she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was an heiress, but because it was really
provoking that a girl whose appearance you could not characterize
except by saying that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) figure was slight and of middle stature, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
features small, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes tolerable, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) complexion sallow, had
nevertheless a certain mental superiority which could not be explained
away--an exasperating thoroughness in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) musical accomplishment, a
fastidious discrimination in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) general tastes, which made it
impossible to force her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) admiration and kept you in awe of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) standard.
This insignificant-looking young lady of four-and-twenty, whom any
one's eyes would have passed over negligently if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not been Miss
Arrowpoint, might be suspected of a secret opinion that Miss Harleth's
acquirements were rather of a common order, and such an opinion was not
made agreeable to think of by being always veiled under a perfect
kindness of manner.

<p/>But Gwendolen did not like to dwell on facts which threw an unfavorable
light on itself. The musical Magus who had so suddenly widened her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
horizon was not always on the scene; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Magus</b></font>) being constantly backward
and forward between London and Quetcham soon began to be thought of as
offering opportunities for converting him (<font color='blue'><b>Magus</b></font>) to a more admiring state of
mind. Meanwhile, in the manifest pleasure her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) singing gave at
Brackenshaw Castle, the Firs, and elsewhere, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
equanimity, being disposed to think approval more trustworthy than
objection, and not being one of the exceptional persons who have a
parching thirst for a perfection undemanded by their neighbors. Perhaps
it would have been rash to say then that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was at all exceptional
inwardly, or that the unusual in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rare grace of
movement and bearing, and a certain daring which gave piquancy to a
very common egoistic ambition, such as exists under many clumsy
exteriors and is taken no notice of. For I suppose that the set of the
head does not really determine the hunger of the inner self for
supremacy: it only makes a difference sometimes as to the way in which
the supremacy is held attainable, and a little also to the degree in
which it can be attained; especially when the hungry one is a girl,
whose passion for doing what is remarkable has an ideal limit in
consistency with the highest breeding and perfect freedom from the
sordid need of income. Gwendolen was as inwardly rebellious against the
restraints of family conditions, and as ready to look through
obligations into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own fundamental want of feeling for them, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been sustained by the boldest speculations; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) really had
no such speculations, and would at once have marked herself off from
any sort of theoretical or practically reforming women by satirizing
them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rejoiced to feel herself exceptional; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) horizon was
that of the genteel romance where the heroine's soul poured out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
journal is full of vague power, originality, and general rebellion,
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life moves strictly in the sphere of fashion; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
wanders into a swamp, the pathos lies partly, so to speak, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
having on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) satin shoes. Here is a restraint which nature and society
have provided on the pursuit of striking adventure; so that a soul
burning with a sense of what the universe is not, and ready to take all
existence as fuel, is nevertheless held captive by the ordinary
wirework of social forms and does nothing particular.

<p/>This commonplace result was what Gwendolen found herself threatened
with even in the novelty of the first winter at Offendene. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
clear upon was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not wish to lead the same sort of life as
ordinary young ladies did; but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not clear upon was, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
should set about leading any other, and what were the particular acts
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would assert her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) freedom by doing. Offendene remained a good
background, if anything would happen there; but on the whole the
neighborhood was in fault.

<p/>Beyond the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) beauty on a first presentation, there was not
much excitement to be got out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) earliest invitations, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) came
home after little sallies of satire and knowingness, such as had
offended Mrs. Arrowpoint, to fill the intervening days with the most
girlish devices. The strongest assertion she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) was able to make of her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>)
individual claims was to leave out Alice's lessons -LRB-on the principle
that Alice was more likely to excel in ignorance-RRB-, and to employ her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
with Miss Merry, and the maid who was understood to wait on all the
ladies, in helping to arrange various dramatic costumes which Gwendolen
pleased herself with having in readiness for some future occasions of
acting in charades or theatrical pieces, occasions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meant to
bring about by force of will or contrivance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never acted--only
made a figure in _tableaux vivans_ at school; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt assured that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could act well, and having been once or twice to the Théâtre
Français, and also heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma speak of Rachel, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) waking dreams
and cogitations as to how she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would manage her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) destiny sometimes turned
on the question whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would become an actress like Rachel, since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) was more beautiful than that thin Jewess. Meanwhile the wet days
before Christmas were passed pleasantly in the preparation of costumes,
Greek, Oriental, and Composite, in which Gwendolen attitudinized and
speechified before a domestic audience, including even the housekeeper,
who was once pressed into it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might swell the notes of
applause; but having shown herself unworthy by observing that Miss
Harleth looked far more like a queen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) own dress than in that
baggy thing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) arms all bare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) was not invited a second time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I look as well as Rachel, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, one day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had been showing herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) Greek dress to Anna, and going through
scraps of scenes with much tragic intention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have better arms than Rachel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, <div class="bookquote">``your arms would
do for anything, Gwen. But your voice is not so tragic as hers; it is
not so deep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can make it deeper, if I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, provisionally; then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) added, with decision, <div class="bookquote">``I think a higher voice is more tragic: it is
more feminine; and the more feminine a woman is, the more tragic it
seems when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does desperate actions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There may be something in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, languidly. <div class="bookquote">``But I
don't know what good there is in making one's blood creep. And if there
is anything horrible to be done, I should like it to be left to the
men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, you are so dreadfully prosaic! As if all the great poetic
criminals were not women! I think the men are poor cautious creatures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear, and you--who are afraid to be alone in the night--I don't
think you would be very bold in crime, thank God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not talking about reality, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, impatiently.
Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma being called out of the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned quickly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
cousin, as if taking an opportunity, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Anna, do ask my uncle
to let us get up some charades at the rectory. Mr. Middleton and Warham
could act with us--just for practice. Mamma says it will not do to have
Mr. Middleton consulting and rehearsing here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) is a stick, but we
could give him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) suitable parts. Do ask, or else I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not till Rex comes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) is so clever, and such a dear old thing,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) will act Napoleon looking over the sea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) looks just like
Napoleon. Rex can do anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't in the least believe in your Rex, Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) will turn out to be like those wretched blue and
yellow water-colors of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) which you hang up in your bedroom and
worship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, you will see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna. <div class="bookquote">``It is not that I know what is
clever, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) has got a scholarship already, and papa says he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will get
a fellowship, and nobody is better at games. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is cleverer than Mr.
Middleton, and everybody but you call Mr. Middleton clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) may be in a dark-lantern sort of way. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) _is_ a stick. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
had to say, ``Perdition catch my soul, but I do love her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would say
it in just the same tone as, <div class="bookquote">``Here endeth the second lesson.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gwendolen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna, shocked at these promiscuous allusions.
``And it is very unkind of you to speak so of him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) admires you
very much. I heard Warham say one day to mamma, ``Middleton is regularly
spooney upon Gwendolen.<div class="bookquote">'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was very angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>); but I know what
it means. It is what they say at college for being in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I help it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, rather contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``Perdition

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, of course; papa, I think, would not wish it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is to go away

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall you do to me when I ridicule Rex?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, wickedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Gwendolen, dear, you _will not_?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes filling
with tears. <div class="bookquote">``I could not bear it. But there really is nothing in him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) to
ridicule. Only you may find out things. For no one ever thought of
laughing at Mr. Middleton before you. Every one said he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) was
nice-looking, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) manners perfect. I am sure I have always been
frightened at him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) learning and his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) square-cut coat, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) being a nephew of the bishop's, and all that. But you will not
ridicule Rex--promise me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>Anna ended with a beseeching look which
touched Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a dear little coz,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, just touching the tip of Anna's
chin with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thumb and forefinger. <div class="bookquote">``I don't ever want to do anything
that will vex you. Especially if Rex is to make everything come
off--charades and everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>And when at last Rex was there, the animation he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) brought into the life
of Offendene and the rectory, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) ready partnership in Gwendolen's
plans, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) no inclination for any ridicule that was not of an open
and flattering kind, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) himself enjoyed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was a fine
open-hearted youth, with a handsome face strongly resembling his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
father's and Anna's, but softer in expression than the one, and larger
in scale than the other: a bright, healthy, loving nature, enjoying
ordinary innocent things so much that vice had no temptation for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>),
and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) knew of it lay too entirely in the outer courts and
little-visited chambers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) mind for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) to think of it with great
repulsion. Vicious habits were with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``what some fellows
did'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``stupid stuff''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) liked to keep aloof from. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) returned
Anna's affection as fully as could be expected of a brother whose
pleasures apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were more than the sum total of hers; and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
had never known a stronger love.

<p/>The cousins were continually together at the one house or the
other--chiefly at Offendene, where there was more freedom, or rather
where there was a more complete sway for Gwendolen; and whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
wished became a ruling purpose for Rex. The charades came off according
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) plans; and also some other little scenes not contemplated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) acting was more impromptu. It was at Offendene that the
charades and _tableaux_ were rehearsed and presented, Mrs. Davilow
seeing no objection even to Mr. Middleton's being invited to share in
them, now that Rex too was there--especially as his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) services were
indispensable: Warham, who was studying for India with a Wanchester
<div class="bookquote">``coach,''  (<font color='red'><b>Warham</b></font>)</div>having no time to spare, and being generally dismal under a
cram of everything except the answers needed at the forthcoming
examination, which might disclose the welfare of our Indian Empire to
be somehow connected with a quotable knowledge of Browne's Pastorals.

<p/>Mr. Middleton was persuaded to play various grave parts, Gwendolen
having flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) enviable immobility of countenance; and at
first a little pained and jealous at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) comradeship with Rex, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
presently drew encouragement from the thought that this sort of
cousinly familiarity excluded any serious passion. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
occasionally felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) more formal treatment of himself was such a
sign of favor as to warrant his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) making advances before he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) left
Pennicote, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had intended to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) feelings in reserve until
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) position should be more assured. Miss Gwendolen, quite aware that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was adored by this unexceptionable young clergyman with pale
whiskers and square-cut collar, felt nothing more on the subject than
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had no objection to being adored: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
with calm mercilessness and caused him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) many mildly agitating hopes by
seeming always to avoid dramatic contact with him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)--for all meanings, we
know, depend on the key of interpretation.

<p/>Some persons might have thought beforehand that a young man of Anglican
leanings, having a sense of sacredness much exercised on small things
as well as great, rarely laughing save from politeness, and in general
regarding the mention of spades by their naked names as rather coarse,
would not have seen a fitting bride for himself in a girl who was
daring in ridicule, and showed none of the special grace required in
the clergyman's wife; or, that a young man informed by theological
reading would have reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not likely to meet the taste
of a lively, restless young lady like Miss Harleth. But are we always
obliged to explain why the facts are not what some persons thought
beforehand? The apology lies on their side, who had that erroneous way
of thinking.

<p/>As for Rex, who would possibly have been sorry for poor Middleton if he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
had been aware of the excellent curate's inward conflict, he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) was too
completely absorbed in a first passion to have observation for any
person or thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) did not observe Gwendolen; he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) only felt what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
said or did, and the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) head seemed to be a good organ of
information as to whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was in the room or out. Before the end of
the first fortnight he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) was so deeply in love that it was impossible for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) life except as bound up with Gwendolen's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) could
see no obstacles, poor boy; his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own love seemed a guarantee of hers,
since it was one with the unperturbed delight in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) image, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
could no more dream of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) pain than an Egyptian could dream
of snow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sang and played to him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) liked, was always glad
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) companionship in riding, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) borrowed steeds were often
comic, was ready to join in any fun of his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>), and showed a right
appreciation of Anna. No mark of sympathy seemed absent. That because
Gwendolen was the most perfect creature in the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was to make a
grand match, had not occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had no conceit--at least not
more than goes to make up the necessary gum and consistence of a
substantial personality: it was only that in the young bliss of loving
he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) took Gwendolen's perfection as part of that good which had seemed
one with life to him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>), being the outcome of a happy, well-embodied
nature.

<p/>One incident which happened in the course of their dramatic attempts
impressed Rex as a sign of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) unusual sensibility. It showed an aspect
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nature which could not have been preconceived by any one who,
like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>), had only seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) habitual fearlessness in active exercises
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) high spirits in society.

<p/>After a good deal of rehearsing it was resolved that a select party
should be invited to Offendene to witness the performances which went
with so much satisfaction to the actors. Anna had caused a pleasant
surprise; nothing could be neater than the way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) played her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
little parts; one would even have suspected her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) of hiding much sly
observation under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) simplicity. And Mr. Middleton answered very well
by not trying to be comic. The main source of doubt and retardation had
been Gwendolen's desire to appear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) Greek dress. No word for a
charade would occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) either waking or dreaming that suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
purpose of getting a statuesque pose in this favorite costume. To
choose a motive from Racine was of no use, since Rex and the others
could not declaim French verse, and improvised speeches would turn the
scene into burlesque. Besides, Mr. Gascoigne prohibited the acting of
scenes from plays: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) usually protested against the notion that an
amusement which was fitting for every one else was unfitting for a
clergyman; but he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) would not in this matter overstep the line of decorum
as drawn in that part of Wessex, which did not exclude his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) sanction of
the young people's acting charades in his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) sister-in-law's house--a very
different affair from private theatricals in the full sense of the word.

<p/>Everybody of course was concerned to satisfy this wish of Gwendolen's,
and Rex proposed that they should wind up with a tableau in which the
effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) majesty would not be marred by any one's speech. This
pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thoroughly, and the only question was the choice of the
tableau.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something pleasant, children, I beseech you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow; <div class="bookquote">``I
can't have any Greek wickedness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no worse than Christian wickedness, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
whose mention of Rachelesque heroines had called forth that remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And less scandalous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, one thinks of it as all gone
by and done with. What do you say to Briseis being led away? I would be
Achilles, and you would be looking round at me--after the print we have
at the rectory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be a good attitude for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a tone of
acceptance. But afterward she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said with decision, <div class="bookquote">``No. It will not do.
There must be three men in proper costume, else it will be ridiculous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, after a little reflection. <div class="bookquote">``Hermione as the
statue in Winter's Tale? I will be Leontes, and Miss Merry, Paulina,
one on each side. Our dress won't signify,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) went on laughingly; <div class="bookquote">``it
will be more Shakespearian and romantic if Leontes looks like Napoleon,
and Paulina like a modern spinster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And Hermione was chosen; all agreeing that age was of no consequence,
but Gwendolen urged that instead of the mere tableau there should be
just enough acting of the scene to introduce the striking up of the
music as a signal for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to step down and advance; when Leontes,
instead of embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), was to kneel and kiss the hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) garment,
and so the curtain was to fall. The antechamber with folding doors lent
itself admirably to the purpose of a stage, and the whole of the
establishment, with the addition of Jarrett the village carpenter, was
absorbed in the preparations for an entertainment, which, considering
that it was an imitation of acting, was likely to be successful, since
we know from ancient fable that an imitation may have more chance of
success than the original.

<p/>Gwendolen was not without a special exultation in the prospect of this
occasion, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew that Herr Klesmer was again at Quetcham, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had taken care to include him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) among the invited.

<p/>Klesmer came. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) was in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) placid, silent moods, and sat in
serene contemplation, replying to all appeals in benignant-sounding
syllables more or less articulate--as taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) cross meekly in a
world overgrown with amateurs, or as careful how he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) lion paws
lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) should crush a rampant and vociferous mouse.

<p/>Everything indeed went off smoothly and according to expectation--all
that was improvised and accidental being of a probable sort--until the
incident occurred which showed Gwendolen in an unforeseen phase of
emotion. How it came about was at first a mystery.

<p/>The tableau of Hermione was doubly striking from its dissimilarity with
what had gone before: it was answering perfectly, and a murmur of
applause had been gradually suppressed while Leontes gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Leontes</b></font>)
permission that Paulina should exercise her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) utmost art and make the
statue move.

<p/>Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) arm resting on a pillar, was elevated by about six
inches, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) counted on as a means of showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) pretty foot and
instep, when at the given signal she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) should advance and descend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Music, awake her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), strike!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paulina</b></font>)</div>said Paulina -LRB-Mrs. Davilow, who, by special
entreaty, had consented to take the part in a white burnous and hood-RRB-.

<p/>Herr Klesmer, who had been good-natured enough to seat himself at the
piano, struck a thunderous chord--but in the same instant, and before
Hermione had put forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) foot, the movable panel, which was on a line
with the piano, flew open on the right opposite the stage and disclosed
the picture of the dead face and the fleeing figure, brought out in
pale definiteness by the position of the wax-lights. Everyone was
startled, but all eyes in the act of turning toward the open panel were
recalled by a piercing cry from Gwendolen, who stood without change of
attitude, but with a change of expression that was terrifying in its
terror. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked like a statue into which a soul of Fear had entered:
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pallid lips were parted; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, usually narrowed under their
long lashes, were dilated and fixed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, less surprised than
alarmed, rushed toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and Rex, too, could not help going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
side. But the touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's arm had the effect of an electric
charge; Gwendolen fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knees and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was still trembling, but mute, and it seemed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
self-consciousness enough to aim at controlling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) signs of terror,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) presently allowed herself to be raised from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) kneeling
posture and led away, while the company were relieving their minds by
explanation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A magnificent bit of _plastik_ that!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer to Miss Arrowpoint.
And a quick fire of undertoned question and answer went round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it part of the play?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, surely not. Miss Harleth was too much affected. A sensitive
creature!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me! I was not aware that there was a painting behind that panel;
were you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; how should I? Some eccentricity in one of the Earl's family long
ago, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very painful! Pray shut it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was the door locked? It is very mysterious. It must be the spirits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is no medium present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that? We must conclude that there is, when such things
happen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the door was not locked; it was probably the sudden vibration from
the piano that sent it open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>This conclusion came from Mr. Gascoigne, who begged Miss Merry if
possible to get the key. But this readiness to explain the mystery was
thought by Mrs. Vulcany unbecoming in a clergyman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vulcany</b></font>) observed in
an undertone that Mr. Gascoigne was always a little too worldly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vulcany</b></font>)
taste. However, the key was produced, and the rector turned it in the
lock with an emphasis rather offensively rationalizing--as who should
say, <div class="bookquote">``it will not start open again'' (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>--putting the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) pocket as a
security.

<p/>However, Gwendolen soon reappeared, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) usual spirits, and
evidently determined to ignore as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could the striking change
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had made in the part of Hermione.

<p/>But when Klesmer said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``We have to thank you for devising a
perfect climax: you could not have chosen a finer bit of _plastik_,''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>there was a flush of pleasure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) liked to accept as a
belief what was really no more than delicate feigning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) divined that
the betrayal into a passion of fear had been mortifying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), and
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) took it for good acting. Gwendolen
cherished the idea that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) was struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) talent as well as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) beauty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uneasiness about his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) opinion was half turned to
complacency.

<p/>But too many were in the secret of what had been included in the
rehearsals, and what had not, and no one besides Klesmer took the
trouble to soothe Gwendolen's imagined mortification. The general
sentiment was that the incident should be let drop.

<p/>There had really been a medium concerned in the starting open of the
panel: one who had quitted the room in haste and crept to bed in much
alarm of conscience. It was the small Isabel, whose intense curiosity,
unsatisfied by the brief glimpse she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) had had of the strange picture on
the day of arrival at Offendene, had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) on the watch for an
opportunity of finding out where Gwendolen had put the key, of stealing
it from the discovered drawer when the rest of the family were out, and
getting on a stool to unlock the panel. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was indulging her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
thirst for knowledge in this way, a noise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feared was an
approaching footstep alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) closed the door and attempted
hurriedly to lock it, but failing and not daring to linger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
withdrew the key and trusted that the panel would stick, as it seemed
well inclined to do. In this confidence she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had returned the key to its
former place, stilling any anxiety by the thought that if the door were
discovered to be unlocked nobody would know how the unlocking came
about. The inconvenient Isabel, like other offenders, did not foresee
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) own impulse to confession, a fatality which came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) the
morning after the party, when Gwendolen said at the breakfast-table, <div class="bookquote">``I
know the door was locked before the housekeeper gave me the key, for I
tried it myself afterward. Some one must have been to my drawer and
taken the key.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed to Isabel that Gwendolen's awful eyes had rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) more
than on the other sisters, and without any time for resolve, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said,
with a trembling lip:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please forgive me, Gwendolen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lip</b></font>)</div><p/>The forgiveness was sooner bestowed than it would have been if
Gwendolen had not desired to dismiss from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own and every one else's
memory any case in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) susceptibility to terror.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wondered at herself in these occasional experiences, which seemed
like a brief remembered madness, an unexplained exception from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
normal life; and in this instance she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt a peculiar vexation that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
helpless fear had shown itself, not, as usual, in solitude, but in
well-lit company. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ideal was to be daring in speech and reckless in
braving dangers, both moral and physical; and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) practice fell
far behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ideal, this shortcoming seemed to be due to the
pettiness of circumstances, the narrow theatre which life offers to a
girl of twenty, who cannot conceive herself as anything else than a
lady, or as in any position which would lack the tribute of respect.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had no permanent consciousness of other fetters, or of more
spiritual restraints, having always disliked whatever was presented to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) under the name of religion, in the same way that some people
dislike arithmetic and accounts: it had raised no other emotion in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
no alarm, no longing; so that the question whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) believed it had
not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) any more than it had occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to inquire
into the conditions of colonial property and banking, on which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had had many opportunities of knowing, the family fortune was
dependent. All these facts about herself she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have been ready to
admit, and even, more or less indirectly, to state. What she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
unwillingly recognized, and would have been glad for others to be
unaware of, was that liability of hers to fits of spiritual dread,
though this fountain of awe within her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not found its way into
connection with the religion taught her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) or with any human relations.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was ashamed and frightened, as at what might happen again, in
remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tremor on suddenly feeling herself alone, when, for
example, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was walking without companionship and there came some
rapid change in the light. Solitude in any wide scene impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
with an undefined feeling of immeasurable existence aloof from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), in
the midst of which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was helplessly incapable of asserting herself.
The little astronomy taught her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at school used sometimes to set her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
imagination at work in a way that made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tremble: but always when
some one joined her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) indifference to the vastness in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed an exile; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found again her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) usual world in which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
will was of some avail, and the religious nomenclature belonging to
this world was no more identified for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with those uneasy impressions
of awe than her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) uncle's surplices seen out of use at the rectory. With
human ears and eyes about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had always hitherto recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
confidence, and felt the possibility of winning empire.

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mamma and others her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fits of timidity or terror were
sufficiently accounted for by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``sensitiveness''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>or the <div class="bookquote">``excitability
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nature'' (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>; but these explanatory phrases required conciliation
with much that seemed to be blank indifference or rare self-mastery.
Heat is a great agent and a useful word, but considered as a means of
explaining the universe it requires an extensive knowledge of
differences; and as a means of explaining character <div class="bookquote">``sensitiveness''  (<font color='red'><b>character</b></font>)</div>is
in much the same predicament. But who, loving a creature like
Gwendolen, would not be inclined to regard every peculiarity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as
a mark of preeminence? That was what Rex did. After the Hermione scene
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was more persuaded than ever that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) must be instinct with all
feeling, and not only readier to respond to a worshipful love, but able
to love better than other girls. Rex felt the summer on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) young wings
and soared happily.

<p/>The first sign of the unimagined snow-storm was like the transparent
white cloud that seems to set off the blue. Anna was in the secret of
Rex's feeling; though for the first time in their lives he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had said
nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) about what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) most thought of, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) only took it for
granted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew it. For the first time, too, Anna could not say
to Rex what was continually in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mind. Perhaps it might have been a
pain which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have had to conceal, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) should so soon care
for some one else more than for herself, if such a feeling had not been
thoroughly neutralized by doubt and anxiety on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) behalf. Anna admired
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cousin--would have said with simple sincerity, <div class="bookquote">``Gwendolen is always
very good to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>and held it in the order of things for herself to be
entirely subject to this cousin; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with mingled
fear and distrust, with a puzzled contemplation as of some wondrous and
beautiful animal whose nature was a mystery, and who, for anything Anna
knew, might have an appetite for devouring all the small creatures that
were her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own particular pets. And now Anna's heart was sinking under
the heavy conviction which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dared not utter, that Gwendolen would
never care for Rex. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) herself held in tenderness and reverence
had constantly seemed indifferent to Gwendolen, and it was easier to
imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) scorning Rex than returning any tenderness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>). Besides,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was always thinking of being something extraordinary. And poor Rex!
Papa would be angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) knew. And of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was too young
to be in love in that way; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), Anna had thought that it would be
years and years before any thing of that sort came, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would
be Rex's housekeeper ever so long. But what a heart must that be which
did not return his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) love! Anna, in the prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) suffering, was
beginning to dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) too fascinating cousin.

<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), as it did to Rex, that the weeks had been filled with
a tumultuous life evident to all observers: if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had been questioned
on the subject he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) would have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had no wish to conceal what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) hoped would be an engagement which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) should immediately tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
father of: and yet for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was reserved not
only about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) feelings but--which was more remarkable to Anna--about
certain actions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) side, was nervous each time her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father or
mother began to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in private lest they should say anything
about Rex and Gwendolen. But the elders were not in the least alive to
this agitating drama, which went forward chiefly in a sort of pantomime
extremely lucid in the minds thus expressing themselves, but easily
missed by spectators who were running their eyes over the _Guardian_ or
the _Clerical Gazette_, and regarded the trivialities of the young ones
with scarcely more interpretation than they gave to the action of
lively ants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going, Rex?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna one gray morning when her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father
had set off in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) carriage to the sessions, Mrs. Gascoigne with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) had observed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) brother had on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) antigropelos, the
utmost approach he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) possessed to a hunting equipment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going to see the hounds throw off at the Three Barns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to take Gwendolen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna, timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) told you, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but I thought--Does papa know you are going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that I am aware of. I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would trouble himself about
the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going to use his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) horse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) knows I do that whenever I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let Gwendolen ride after the hounds, Rex,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna, whose
fears gifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with second-sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, smiling rather provokingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa and mamma and aunt Davilow all wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) not to. They think it is
not right for her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) is going to do what is not right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gwendolen minds nobody sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna getting bolder by dint of
a little anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would not mind me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, perversely making a joke of
poor Anna's anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh Rex, I cannot bear it. You will make yourself very unhappy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>Here
Anna burst into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nannie, Nannie, what on earth is the matter with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, a
little impatient at being kept in this way, hat on and whip in hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) will not care for you one bit--I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) never will!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the
poor child in a sobbing whisper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had lost all control of herself.

<p/>Rex reddened and hurried away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) out of the hall door, leaving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to the miserable consciousness of having made herself disagreeable
in vain.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) did think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) words as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) rode along; they had the unwelcomeness
which all unfavorable fortune-telling has, even when laughed at; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
quickly explained them as springing from little Anna's tenderness, and
began to be sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was obliged to come away without soothing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). Every other feeling on the subject, however, was quickly merged in
a resistant belief to the contrary of hers, accompanied with a new
determination to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was right. This sort of certainty had
just enough kinship to doubt and uneasiness to hurry on a confession
which an untouched security might have delayed.

<p/>Gwendolen was already mounted and riding up and down the avenue when
Rex appeared at the gate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had provided herself against
disappointment in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) did not appear in time by having the groom
ready behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would not have waited beyond a reasonable
time. But now the groom was dismissed, and the two rode away in
delightful freedom. Gwendolen was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) highest spirits, and Rex
thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never looked so lovely before; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) figure, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
long white throat, and the curves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cheek and chin were always set
off to perfection by the compact simplicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) riding dress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
could not conceive a more perfect girl; and to a youthful lover like
Rex it seems that the fundamental identity of the good, the true and
the beautiful, is already extant and manifest in the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
love. Most observers would have held it more than equally accountable
that a girl should have like impressions about Rex, for in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) handsome
face there was nothing corresponding to the undefinable stinging
quality--as it were a trace of demon ancestry--which made some
beholders hesitate in their admiration of Gwendolen.

<p/>It was an exquisite January morning in which there was no threat of
rain, but a gray sky making the calmest background for the charms of a
mild winter scene--the grassy borders of the lanes, the hedgerows
sprinkled with red berries and haunted with low twitterings, the purple
bareness of the elms, the rich brown of the furrows. The horses' hoofs
made a musical chime, accompanying their young voices. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was laughing
at his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) equipment, for he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) was the reverse of a dandy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) was
enjoying her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) laughter; the freshness of the morning mingled with the
freshness of their youth; and every sound that came from their clear
throats, every glance they gave each other, was the bubbling outflow
from a spring of joy. It was all morning to them, within and without.
And thinking of them in these moments one is tempted to that futile
sort of wishing--if only things could have been a little otherwise
then, so as to have been greatly otherwise after--if only these two
beautiful young creatures could have pledged themselves to each other
then and there, and never through life have swerved from that pledge!
For some of the goodness which Rex believed in was there. Goodness is a
large, often a prospective word; like harvest, which at one stage when
we talk of it lies all underground, with an indeterminate future; is
the germ prospering in the darkness? at another, it has put forth
delicate green blades, and by-and-by the trembling blossoms are ready
to be dashed off by an hour of rough wind or rain. Each stage has its
peculiar blight, and may have the healthy life choked out of it by a
particular action of the foul land which rears or neighbors it, or by
damage brought from foulness afar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna had got it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head that you would want to ride after the
hounds this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, whose secret associations with Anna's
words made this speech seem quite perilously near the most momentous of
subjects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, laughingly. <div class="bookquote">``What a little clairvoyant she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, who had not believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) intending to do it
if the elders objected, but confided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) having good reasons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I can't tell what I shall do till I get there.

fond of what is likely: it is always dull. I do what is unlikely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I could. I should turn round and do what was likely for people in

contradictoriness makes the strongest likelihood of all. You must give
up a plan.''

her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head and neck: if the angle there had been different, the chin
protrusive, and the cervical vertebrae a trifle more curved in their
position, ten to one Gwendolen's words would have had a jar in them for
the sweet-natured Rex. But everything odd in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) speech was humor and
pretty banter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was only anxious to turn toward one point.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you manage to feel only what pleases you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not; that comes from what other people do. But if the world
were pleasanter, one would only feel what was pleasant. Girls' lives
are so stupid: they never do what they like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought that was more the case of the men. They are forced to do

after all you have your own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it. I never saw a married woman who had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What should you like to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, quite guilelessly, and in real
anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know!--go to the North Pole, or ride steeple-chases, or go
to be a queen in the East like Lady Hester Stanhope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
flightily. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) words were born on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have been at
a loss to give an answer of deeper origin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean you would never be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I didn't say that. Only when I married, I should not do as other
women do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might do just as you liked if you married a man who loved you more
dearly than anything else in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, who, poor youth, was
moving in themes outside the curriculum in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had promised to win
distinction. <div class="bookquote">``I know one who does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk of Mr. Middleton, for heaven's sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
hastily, a quick blush spreading over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face and neck; <div class="bookquote">``that is
Anna's chant. I hear the hounds. Let us go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chestnut to a canter, and Rex had no choice but to follow
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) felt encouraged. Gwendolen was perfectly aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
cousin was in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had no idea that the matter was of
any consequence, having never had the slightest visitation of painful
love herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wished the small romance of Rex's devotion to fill up
the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) stay at Pennicote, and to avoid explanations which
would bring it to an untimely end. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) objected, with a sort
of physical repulsion, to being directly made love to. With all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
imaginative delight in being adored, there was a certain fierceness of
maidenhood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/>But all other thoughts were soon lost for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in the excitement of the
scene at the Three Barns. Several gentlemen of the hunt knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) exchanged pleasant greetings. Rex could not get another word with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). The color, the stir of the field had taken possession of Gwendolen
with a strength which was not due to habitual associations, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
never yet ridden after the hounds--only said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should like to do it,
and so drawn forth a prohibition; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma dreading the danger, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle declaring that for his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) part he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) held that kind of violent
exercise unseemly in a woman, and that whatever might be done in other
parts of the country, no lady of good position followed the Wessex
hunt: no one but Mrs. Gadsby, the yeomanry captain's wife, who had been
a kitchenmaid and still spoke like one. This last argument had some
effect on Gwendolen, and had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) halting between her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) desire to
assert her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) freedom and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) horror of being classed with Mrs. Gadsby.

<p/>Some of the most unexceptionable women in the neighborhood occasionally
went to see the hounds throw off; but it happened that none of them
were present this morning to abstain from following, while Mrs. Gadsby,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gadsby</b></font>) doubtful antecedents, grammatical and otherwise, was not
visible to make following seem unbecoming. Thus Gwendolen felt no check
on the animal stimulus that came from the stir and tongue of the
hounds, the pawing of the horses, the varying voices of men, the
movement hither and thither of vivid color on the background of green
and gray stillness:--that utmost excitement of the coming chase which
consists in feeling something like a combination of dog and horse, with
the superadded thrill of social vanities and consciousness of
centaur-power which belongs to humankind.

<p/>Rex would have felt more of the same enjoyment if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) could have kept
nearer to Gwendolen, and not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) constantly occupied with
acquaintances, or looked at by would-be acquaintances, all on lively
horses which veered about and swept the surrounding space as
effectually as a revolving lever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to see you here this fine morning, Miss Harleth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Brackenshaw/Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div>said Lord
Brackenshaw, a middle-aged peer of aristocratic seediness in stained
pink, with easy-going manners which would have made the threatened
deluge seem of no consequence. <div class="bookquote">``We shall have a first-rate run. A pity
you didn't go with us. Have you ever tried your little chestnut at a
ditch? you wouldn't be afraid, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. And that was true: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was never fearful in action and companionship. <div class="bookquote">``I have often taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
at some rails and a ditch too, near--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, by Jove!''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) lordship, quietly, in notation that something
was happening which must break off the dialogue: and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) reined off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) horse, Rex was bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) sober hackney up to Gwendolen's side
when--the hounds gave tongue, and the whole field was in motion as if
the whirl of the earth were carrying it; Gwendolen along with
everything else; no word of notice to Rex, who without a second thought
followed too. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) let Gwendolen go alone? under other
circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) would have enjoyed the run, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was just now
perturbed by the check which had been put on the impetus to utter his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
love, and get utterance in return, an impetus which could not at once
resolve itself into a totally different sort of chase, at least with
the consciousness of being on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father's gray nag, a good horse
enough in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) way, but of sober years and ecclesiastical habits.
Gwendolen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spirited little chestnut was up with the best, and
felt as secure as an immortal goddess, having, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had thought of
risk, a core of confidence that no ill luck would happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought of no such thing, and certainly not of any risk there might
be for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cousin. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), it would have struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
as a droll picture that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should be gradually falling behind, and
looking round in search of gates: a fine lithe youth, whose heart must
be panting with all the spirit of a beagle, stuck as if under a
wizard's spell on a stiff clerical hackney, would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) laugh
with a sense of fun much too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to reflect on his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>)
mortification. But Gwendolen was apt to think rather of those who saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) than of those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not see; and Rex was soon so far
behind that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had looked she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would not have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>). For I grieve
to say that in the search for a gate, along a lane lately mended,
Primrose fell, broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) knees, and undesignedly threw Rex over his (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>)
head.

<p/>Fortunately a blacksmith's son who also followed the hounds under
disadvantages, namely, on foot -LRB-a loose way of hunting which had struck
some even frivolous minds as immoral-RRB-, was naturally also in the rear,
and happened to be within sight of Rex's misfortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) ran to give
help which was greatly needed, for Rex was a great deal stunned, and
the complete recovery of sensation came in the form of pain. Joel Dagge
on this occasion showed himself that most useful of personages, whose
knowledge is of a kind suited to the immediate occasion: he (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) not only
knew perfectly well what was the matter with the horse, how far they
were both from the nearest public-house and from Pennicote Rectory, and
could certify to Rex that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) shoulder was only a bit out of joint, but
also offered experienced surgical aid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, sir, let me shove it in again for you! I's seen Nash, the

musn't make believe as you can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joel</b></font>)</div><p/>Joel being clearly a low character, it is, happily, not necessary to
say more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) to the refined reader, than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) helped Rex to get
home with as little delay as possible. There was no alternative but to
get home, though all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) was in anxiety about Gwendolen, and
more miserable in the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), too, might have had an
accident, than in the pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) own bruises and the annoyance he (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) was
about to cause his (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joel</b></font>) comforted himself about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) by reflecting
that every one would be anxious to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and that some
acquaintance would be sure to conduct her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) home.

<p/>Mr. Gascoigne was already at home, and was writing letters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)
study, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) was interrupted by seeing poor Rex come in with a face
which was not the less handsome and ingratiating for being pale and a
little distressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was secretly the favorite son, and a young
portrait of the father; who, however, never treated him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with any
partiality--rather, with an extra rigor. Mr. Gascoigne having inquired
of Anna, knew that Rex had gone with Gwendolen to the meet at the Three
Barns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) said hastily, not laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) pen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry, sir; Primrose has fallen down and broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) knees.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, with a touch of
severity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) rarely gave way to temper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Three Barns to see the hounds throw off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you were fool enough to follow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. I didn't go at any fences, but the horse got his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) leg into a
hole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you got hurt yourself, I hope, eh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I got my shoulder put out, but a young blacksmith put it in again for
me. I'm just a little battered, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry about the horse, sir; I knew it would be a vexation to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what has become of Gwendolen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, abruptly. Rex,
who did not imagine that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) father had made any inquiries about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>),
answered at first with a blush, which was the more remarkable for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)
previous paleness. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) said, nervously--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am anxious to know--I should like to go or send at once to
Offendene--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rides so well, and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would keep up--there
would most likely be many round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) who led you on, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, laying
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) pen, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) chair, and looking at Rex with more
marked examination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was natural for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to want to go: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) didn't intend it
beforehand--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was led away by the spirit of the thing. And, of
course, I went when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gascoigne left a brief interval of silence, and then said, with
quiet irony,--<div class="bookquote">``But now you observe, young gentleman, that you are not
furnished with a horse which will enable you to play the squire to your
cousin. You must give up that amusement. You have spoiled my nag for
me, and that is enough mischief for one vacation. I shall beg you to
get ready to start for Southampton to-morrow and join Stilfox, till you
go up to Oxford with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). That will be good for your bruises as well as
your studies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Rex felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) heart swelling and comporting itself as if it had
been no better than a girl's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will not insist on my going immediately, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you feel too ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not that--but--''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>here Rex bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) lips and felt the tears
starting, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) great vexation; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) rallied and tried to say more
firmly, <div class="bookquote">``I want to go to Offendene, but I can go this evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going there myself. I can bring word about Gwendolen, if that is
what you want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Rex broke down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) discerned an intention fatal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
happiness, nay, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was accustomed to believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father's
penetration, and to expect firmness. <div class="bookquote">``Father, I can't go away without
telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) loves me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gascoigne was inwardly going through some self-rebuke for not being
more wary, and was now really sorry for the lad; but every
consideration was subordinate to that of using the wisest tactics in
the case. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had quickly made up his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mind and to answer the more
quietly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy, you are too young to be taking momentous, decisive steps
of that sort. This is a fancy which you have got into your head during
an idle week or two: you must set to work at something and dismiss it.
There is every reason against it. An engagement at your age would be
totally rash and unjustifiable; and moreover, alliances between first
cousins are undesirable. Make up your mind to a brief disappointment.
Life is full of them. We have all got to be broken in; and this is a
mild beginning for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not mild. I can't bear it. I shall be good for nothing. I
shouldn't mind anything, if it were settled between us. I could do
anything then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, impetuously. <div class="bookquote">``But it's of no use to pretend
that I will obey you. I can't do it. If I said I would, I should be
sure to break my word. I should see Gwendolen again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, wait till to-morrow morning, that we may talk of the matter
again--you will promise me that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, quietly; and Rex
did not, could not refuse.

<p/>The rector did not even tell his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) had any other reason for
going to Offendene that evening than his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) desire to ascertain that
Gwendolen had got home safely. He (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) more than safe--elated. Mr.
Quallon, who had won the brush, had delivered the trophy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had brought it before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), fastened on the saddle; more than that,
Lord Brackenshaw had conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) home, and had shown himself
delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spirited riding. All this was told at once to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
uncle, that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) might see how well justified she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been in acting
against his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) advice; and the prudential rector did feel himself in a
slight difficulty, for at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) was particularly sensible that
it was his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) niece's serious interest to be well regarded by the
Brackenshaws, and their opinion as to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) following the hounds really
touched the essence of his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) objection. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) was not obliged to
say anything immediately, for Mrs. Davilow followed up Gwendolen's
brief triumphant phrases with--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, I do hope you will not do it again, Gwendolen. I should never
have a moment's quiet. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) father died by an accident, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mrs. Davilow had turned away from Gwendolen, and looked at Mr.
Gascoigne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) merrily, and passing over
the question of the fears which Mrs. Davilow had meant to account for,
<div class="bookquote">``children don't take after their parents in broken legs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>Not one word had yet been said about Rex. In fact there had been no
anxiety about him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) at Offendene. Gwendolen had observed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma,
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must have been left far behind, and gone home in despair,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>and
it could not be denied that this was fortunate so far as it made way
for Lord Brackenshaw's bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) home. But now Mr. Gascoigne said,
with some emphasis, looking at Gwendolen--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the exploit has ended better for you than for Rex.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had to make a terrible round. You have not taught
Primrose to take the fences, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, without the
faintest shade of alarm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looks and tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rex has had a fall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, curtly, throwing himself into
an arm-chair resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) elbows and fitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) palms and fingers
together, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) lips and looked at Gwendolen, who said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, poor fellow! he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) is not hurt, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>with a correct look of
anxiety such as elated mortals try to super-induce when their pulses
are all the while quick with triumph; and Mrs. Davilow, in the same
moment, uttered a low <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! There!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gascoigne went on: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) shoulder out, and got some bruises,
I believe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) made another little pause of observation; but
Gwendolen, instead of any such symptoms as pallor and silence, had only
deepened the compassionateness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brow and eyes, and said again,
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, poor fellow! it is nothing serious, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Gascoigne held
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) diagnosis complete. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) wished to make assurance doubly sure,
and went on still with a purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arm set again rather oddly. Some blacksmith--not a
parishioner of mine--was on the field--a loose fish, I suppose, but
handy, and set the arm for him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) immediately. So after all, I believe, I
and Primrose come off worst. The horse's knees are cut to pieces. He (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>)
came down in a hole, it seems, and pitched Rex over his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen's face had allowably become contented again, since Rex's arm
had been reset; and now, at the descriptive suggestions in the latter
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle's speech, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) elated spirits made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) features less
unmanageable than usual; the smiles broke forth, and finally a
descending scale of laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a pretty young lady--to laugh at other people's calamities,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, with a milder sense of disapprobation than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)
had not had counteracting reasons to be glad that Gwendolen showed no
deep feeling on the occasion.

<p/>``Pray forgive me, uncle. Now Rex is safe, it is so droll to fancy the
figure he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) and Primrose would cut--in a lane all by themselves--only a
blacksmith running up. It would make a capital caricature of <div class="bookquote">``Following
the Hounds.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen rather valued herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) superior freedom in laughing
where others might only see matter for seriousness. Indeed, the
laughter became her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) person so well that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) opinion of its gracefulness
was often shared by others; and it even entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle's course
of thought at this moment, that it was no wonder a boy should be
fascinated by this young witch--who, however, was more mischievous than
could be desired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you laugh at broken bones, child?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, still
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) dominant anxiety. <div class="bookquote">``I wish we had never allowed you to have
the horse. You will see that we were wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) added, looking with a
grave nod at Mr. Gascoigne--<div class="bookquote">``at least I was, to encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in asking
for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, seriously, Gwendolen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, in a judicious tone of
rational advice to a person understood to be altogether rational, <div class="bookquote">``I
strongly recommend you--I shall ask you to oblige me so far--not to
repeat your adventure of to-day. Lord Brackenshaw is very kind, but I
feel sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) would concur with me in what I say. To be spoken of
as `the young lady who hunts' by way of exception, would give a tone to
the language about you which I am sure you would not like. Depend upon
it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) lordship would not choose that Lady Beatrice or Lady Maria
should hunt in this part of the country, if they were old enough to do
so. When you are married, it will be different: you may do whatever
your husband sanctions. But if you intend to hunt, you must marry a man
who can keep horses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why I should do anything so horrible as to marry without
_that_ prospect, at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, pettishly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle's
speech had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) annoyance, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not show more directly;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was committing herself, and after moving
carelessly to another part of the room, went out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) always speaks in that way about marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow; <div class="bookquote">``but
it will be different when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) has seen the right person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) heart has never been in the least touched, that you know of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Gascoigne.

<p/>Mrs. Davilow shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) head silently. ``It was only last night she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) said
to me, <div class="bookquote">``Mamma, I wonder how girls manage to fall in love. It is easy to
make them do it in books. But men are too ridiculous.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gascoigne laughed a little, and made no further remark on the
subject. The next morning at breakfast he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are your bruises, Rex?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not very mellow yet, sir; only beginning to turn a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't feel quite ready for a journey to Southampton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>answered Rex, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) heart metaphorically in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can wait till to-morrow, and go to say goodbye to them at
Offendene.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gascoigne, who now knew the whole affair, looked steadily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)
coffee lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) also should begin to cry, as Anna was doing already.

<p/>Mr. Gascoigne felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) was applying a sharp remedy to poor Rex's
acute attack, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) believed it to be in the end the kindest. To let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) know the hopelessness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) love from Gwendolen's own lips might
be curative in more ways than one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only be thankful that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) doesn't care about him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gascoigne, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) husband in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) study. <div class="bookquote">``There are things
in Gwendolen I cannot reconcile myself to. My Anna is worth two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>),
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) beauty and talent. It looks very ill in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) will
not help in the schools with Anna--not even in the Sunday-school. What
you or I advise is of no consequence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>): and poor Fannie is
completely under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thumb. But I know you think better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Gascoigne ended with a deferential hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, there is no harm in the girl. It is only that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has a
high spirit, and it will not do to hold the reins too tight. The point
is, to get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) well married. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has a little too much fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) present life with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother and sisters. It is natural and right
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should be married soon--not to a poor man, but one who can
give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a fitting position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Presently Rex, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) arm in a sling, was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) two miles' walk to
Offendene. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was rather puzzled by the unconditional permission to see
Gwendolen, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father's real ground of action could not enter into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) conjectures. If it had, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) would first have thought it horribly
cold-blooded, and then have disbelieved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father's conclusions.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) got to the house, everybody was there but Gwendolen. The four
girls, hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) speak in the hall, rushed out of the library, which
was their school-room, and hung round him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) with compassionate inquiries
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) arm. Mrs. Davilow wanted to know exactly what had happened,
and where the blacksmith lived, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) might make him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) a present;
while Miss Merry, who took a subdued and melancholy part in all family
affairs, doubted whether it would not be giving too much encouragement
to that kind of character. Rex had never found the family troublesome
before, but just now he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) wished them all away and Gwendolen there, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was too uneasy for good-natured feigning. When at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had said,
<div class="bookquote">``Where is Gwendolen?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Davilow had told Alice to go and see if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) sister were come down, adding, <div class="bookquote">``I sent up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) breakfast this
morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) needed a long rest.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Rex took the shortest way out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
endurance by saying, almost impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``Aunt, I want to speak to
Gwendolen--I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, dear; go into the drawing-room. I will send her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) there,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, who had observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was fond of being with
Gwendolen, as was natural, but had not thought of this as having any
bearing on the realities of life: it seemed merely part of the
Christmas holidays which were spinning themselves out.

<p/>Rex for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) part thought that the realities of life were all hanging on
this interview. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had to walk up and down the drawing-room in
expectation for nearly ten minutes--ample space for all imaginative
fluctuations; yet, strange to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was unvaryingly occupied in
thinking what and how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) could do, when Gwendolen had accepted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>), to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father that the engagement was the most prudent
thing in the world, since it inspired him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) with double energy for work.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was to be a lawyer, and what reason was there why he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) should not rise
as high as Eldon did? He (<font color='blue'><b>Eldon</b></font>) was forced to look at life in the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eldon</b></font>)
father's mind.

<p/>But when the door opened and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) whose presence he (<font color='blue'><b>Eldon</b></font>) was longing for
entered, there came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Eldon</b></font>) suddenly and mysteriously a state of
tremor and distrust which he (<font color='blue'><b>Eldon</b></font>) had never felt before. Miss Gwendolen,
simple as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stood there, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) black silk, cut square about the
round white pillar of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) throat, a black band fastening her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hair which
streamed backward in smooth silky abundance, seemed more queenly than
usual. Perhaps it was that there was none of the latent fun and
tricksiness which had always pierced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) greeting of Rex. How much
of this was due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) presentiment from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had said yesterday
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was going to talk of love? How much from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) desire to show
regret about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) accident? Something of both. But the wisdom of ages
has hinted that there is a side of the bed which has a malign influence
if you happen to get out on it; and this accident befalls some charming
persons rather frequently. Perhaps it had befallen Gwendolen this
morning. The hastening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) toilet, the way in which Bugle used the
brush, the quality of the shilling serial mistakenly written for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
amusement, the probabilities of the coming day, and, in short, social
institutions generally, were all objectionable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). It was not that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was out of temper, but that the world was not equal to the demands
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fine organism.

<p/>However it might be, Rex saw an awful majesty about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) entered
and put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>), without the least approach to a smile in
eyes or mouth. The fun which had moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in the evening had quite
evaporated from the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) accident, and the whole affair seemed
stupid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said with perfect propriety, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you are not
much hurt, Rex; I deserve that you should reproach me for your
accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, feeling the soul within him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) spreading itself
like an attack of illness. <div class="bookquote">``There is hardly any thing the matter with
me. I am so glad you had the pleasure: I would willingly pay for it by
a tumble, only I was sorry to break the horse's knees.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen walked to the hearth and stood looking at the fire in the
most inconvenient way for conversation, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) could only get a
side view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father wants me to go to Southampton for the rest of the vacation,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) baritone trembling a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Southampton! That's a stupid place to go to, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, chilly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be to me, because you would not be there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you mind about me going away, Gwendolen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course. Every one is of consequence in this dreary country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, curtly. The perception that poor Rex wanted to be tender
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) curl up and harden like a sea-anemone at the touch of a finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you angry with me, Gwendolen? Why do you treat me in this way all
at once?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, flushing, and with more spirit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) voice, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) too were capable of being angry.

<p/>Gwendolen looked round at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Treat you? Nonsense! I am
only rather cross. Why did you come so very early? You must expect to
find tempers in dishabille.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be as cross with me as you like--only don't treat me with
indifference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, imploringly. <div class="bookquote">``All the happiness of my life
depends on your loving me--if only a little--better than any one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) tried to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hastily eluded his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) grasp and moved
to the other end of the hearth, facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't make love to me! I hate it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) fiercely.

<p/>Rex turned pale and was silent, but could not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) eyes off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
and the impetus was not yet exhausted that made hers dart death at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>).
Gwendolen herself could not have foreseen that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should feel in this
way. It was all a sudden, new experience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). The day before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
been quite aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cousin was in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not mind
how much, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said nothing about it; and if any one had asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) objected to love-making speeches, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have said,
laughingly, <div class="bookquote">``Oh I am tired of them all in the books.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But now the life
of passion had begun negatively in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt passionately averse to
this volunteered love.

<p/>To Rex at twenty the joy of life seemed at an end more absolutely than
it can do to a man at forty. But before they had ceased to look at each
other, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did speak again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that last word you have to say to me, Gwendolen? Will it always be
so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not help seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wretchedness and feeling a little regret
for the old Rex who had not offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Decisively, but yet with some
return of kindness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About making love? Yes. But I don't dislike you for anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was just a perceptible pause before he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) said a low <div class="bookquote">``good-bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
passed out of the room. Almost immediately after, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heard the heavy
hall door bang behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Davilow, too, had heard Rex's hasty departure, and presently came
into the drawing-room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) found Gwendolen seated on the low
couch, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face buried, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hair falling over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) figure like a
garment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was sobbing bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``My child, my child, what is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>cried the mother, who had never before seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) darling struck down in
this way, and felt something of the alarmed anguish that women, feel at
the sight of overpowering sorrow in a strong man; for this child had
been her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ruler. Sitting down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with circling arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
cheek against Gwendolen's head, and then tried to draw it upward.
Gwendolen gave way, and letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head rest against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, cried
out sobbingly, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, what can become of my life? there is nothing
worth living for!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow. Usually she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) herself had been rebuked by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) daughter for involuntary signs of despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never love anybody. I can't love people. I hate them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The time will come, dear, the time will come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen was more and more convulsed with sobbing; but putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's neck with an almost painful clinging, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said
brokenly, <div class="bookquote">``I can't bear any one to be very near me but you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the mother began to sob, for this spoiled child had never shown
such dependence on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) before: and so they clung to each other.




<p/>CHAPTER VIII.

<p/>What name doth Joy most borrow
When life is fair?
<div class="bookquote">``To-morrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What name doth best fit Sorrow
In young despair?
<div class="bookquote">``To-morrow.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a much more lasting trouble at the rectory. Rex arrived there
only to throw himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) bed in a state of apparent apathy,
unbroken till the next day, when it began to be interrupted by more
positive signs of illness. Nothing could be said about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) going to
Southampton: instead of that, the chief thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) mother and Anna
was how to tend this patient who did not want to be well, and from
being the brightest, most grateful spirit in the household, was
metamorphosed into an irresponsive, dull-eyed creature who met all
affectionate attempts with a murmur of <div class="bookquote">``Let me alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>an creature</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father
looked beyond the crisis, and believed it to be the shortest way out of
an unlucky affair; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was sorry for the inevitable suffering, and
went now and then to sit by him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) in silence for a few minutes, parting
with a gentle pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) hand on Rex's blank brow, and a <div class="bookquote">``God
bless you, my boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>Warham and the younger children used to peep round
the edge of the door to see this incredible thing of their lively
brother being laid low; but fingers were immediately shaken at them to
drive them back. The guardian who was always there was Anna, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
little hand was allowed to rest within her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brother's, though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never
gave it a welcoming pressure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul was divided between anguish for
Rex and reproach of Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it is wicked of me, but I think I never _can_ love her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) again,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>came as the recurrent burden of poor little Anna's inward monody. And
even Mrs. Gascoigne had an angry feeling toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) niece which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)
could not refrain from expressing -LRB-apologetically-RRB- to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know of course it is better, and we ought to be thankful that she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is
not in love with the poor boy; but really. Henry, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is hard;
she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has the heart of a coquette. I can not help thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) must
have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) believe something, or the disappointment would not have
taken hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in that way. And some blame attaches to poor Fanny;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is quite blind about that girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gascoigne answered imperatively: <div class="bookquote">``The less said on that point the
better, Nancy. I ought to have been more awake myself. As to the boy,
be thankful if nothing worse ever happens to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Let the thing die out
as quickly as possible; and especially with regard to Gwendolen--let it
be as if it had never been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>The rector's dominant feeling was that there had been a great escape.
Gwendolen in love with Rex in return would have made a much harder
problem, the solution of which might have been taken out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) hands.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had to go through some further difficulty.

<p/>One fine morning Rex asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) bath, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) toilet as usual.
Anna, full of excitement at this change, could do nothing but listen
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) coming down, and at last hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) step, ran to the foot of
the stairs to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>). For the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a faint smile,
but it looked so melancholy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) pale face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could hardly help
crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nannie!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) said gently, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand and leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) slowly along
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) to the drawing-room. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) mother was there, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came
to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``What a plague I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) sat still and looked out of the bow-window on the lawn and
shrubs covered with hoar-frost, across which the sun was sending faint
occasional gleams:--something like that sad smile on Rex's face, Anna
thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had had a resurrection into a new world, and
did not know what to do with himself there, the old interests being
left behind. Anna sat near him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>), pretending to work, but really watching
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) with yearning looks. Beyond the garden hedge there was a road where
wagons and carts sometimes went on field-work: a railed opening was
made in the hedge, because the upland with its bordering wood and clump
of ash-trees against the sky was a pretty sight. Presently there came
along a wagon laden with timber; the horses were straining their grand
muscles, and the driver having cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) whip, ran along anxiously to
guide the leader's head, fearing a swerve. Rex seemed to be shaken into
attention, rose and looked till the last quivering trunk of the timber
had disappeared, and then walked once or twice along the room. Mrs.
Gascoigne was no longer there, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) came to sit down again,
Anna, seeing a return of speech in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brother's eyes, could not resist
the impulse to bring a little stool and seat herself against his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knee,
looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with an expression which seemed to say, <div class="bookquote">``Do speak to
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what I'm thinking of, Nannie. I will go to Canada, or
somewhere of that sort.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Rex had not studied the character of our
colonial possessions.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Rex, not for always!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to get my bread there. I should like to build a hut, and work
hard at clearing, and have everything wild about me, and a great wide
quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And not take me with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna, the big tears coming fast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like it better than anything; and settlers go with their
families. I would sooner go there than stay here in England. I could
make the fires, and mend the clothes, and cook the food; and I could
learn how to make the bread before we went. It would be nicer than
anything--like playing at life over again, as we used to do when we
made our tent with the drugget, and had our little plates and dishes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father and mother would not let you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think they would, when I explained everything. It would save
money; and papa would have more to bring up the boys with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>There was further talk of the same practical kind at intervals, and it
ended in Rex's being obliged to consent that Anna should go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father on the subject.

<p/>Of course it was when the rector was alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) study. Their mother
would become reconciled to whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) decided on, but mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
first, the question would have distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my children!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, cheerfully, as they entered.
It was a comfort to see Rex about again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May we sit down with you a little, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna. <div class="bookquote">``Rex has
something to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>these creatures</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a noticeable group that these three creatures made, each of them
with a face of the same structural type--the straight brow, the nose
suddenly straightened from an intention of being aquiline, the short
upper lip, the short but strong and well-hung chin: there was even the
same tone of complexion and set of the eye. The gray-haired father was
at once massive and keen-looking; there was a perpendicular line in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
brow which when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke with any force of interest deepened; and the
habit of ruling gave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) an air of reserved authoritativeness. Rex
would have seemed a vision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father's youth, if it had been
possible to imagine Mr. Gascoigne without distinct plans and without
command, smitten with a heart sorrow, and having no more notion of
concealment than a sick animal; and Anna was a tiny copy of Rex, with
hair drawn back and knotted, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face following his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) in its changes of
expression, as if they had one soul between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know all about what has upset me, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>Rex began, and Mr.
Gascoigne nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite done up for life in this part of the world. I am sure it
will be no use my going back to Oxford. I couldn't do any reading. I
should fail, and cause you expense for nothing. I want to have your
consent to take another course, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gascoigne nodded more slowly, the perpendicular line on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) brow
deepened, and Anna's trembling increased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you would allow me a small outfit, I should like to go to the
colonies and work on the land there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>Rex thought the vagueness of the
phrase prudential; <div class="bookquote">``the colonies''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>necessarily embracing more
advantages, and being less capable of being rebutted on a single ground
than any particular settlement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, and with me, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna, not bearing to be left out from the
proposal even temporarily. <div class="bookquote">``Rex would want some one to take care of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>), you know--some one to keep house. And we shall never, either of
us, be married. And I should cost nothing, and I should be so happy. I
know it would be hard to leave you and mamma; but there are all the
others to bring up, and we two should be no trouble to you any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna had risen from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seat, and used the feminine argument of going
closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) papa as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did not smile, but he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) on
his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) knee and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) there, as if to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gently out of the
question while he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) spoke to Rex.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will admit that my experience gives me some power of judging for
you, and that I can probably guide you in practical matters better than
you can guide yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Rex was obliged to say, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And perhaps you will admit--though I don't wish to press that
point--that you are bound in duty to consider my judgment and wishes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never yet placed myself in opposition to you, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>Rex in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
secret soul could not feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was bound not to go to the colonies,
but to go to Oxford again--which was the point in question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will do so if you persist in setting your mind toward a rash
and foolish procedure, and deafening yourself to considerations which
my experience of life assures me of. You think, I suppose, that you
have had a shock which has changed all your inclinations, stupefied
your brains, unfitted you for anything but manual labor, and given you
a dislike to society? Is that what you believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something like that. I shall never be up to the sort of work I must do
to live in this part of the world. I have not the spirit for it. I
shall never be the same again. And without any disrespect to you,
father, I think a young fellow should be allowed to choose his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) way of
life, if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) does nobody any harm. There are plenty to stay at home, and
those who like might be allowed to go where there are empty places.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But suppose I am convinced on good evidence--as I am--that this state
of mind of yours is transient, and that if you went off as you propose,
you would by-and-by repent, and feel that you had let yourself slip
back from the point you have been gaining by your education till now?
Have you not strength of mind enough to see that you had better act on
my assurance for a time, and test it? In my opinion, so far from
agreeing with you that you should be free to turn yourself into a
colonist and work in your shirt-sleeves with spade and hatchet--in my
opinion you have no right whatever to expatriate yourself until you
have honestly endeavored to turn to account the education you have
received here. I say nothing of the grief to your mother and me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry; but what can I do? I can't study--that's certain,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not just now, perhaps. You will have to miss a term. I have made
arrangements for you--how you are to spend the next two months. But I
confess I am disappointed in you, Rex. I thought you had more sense
than to take up such ideas--to suppose that because you have fallen
into a very common trouble, such as most men have to go through, you
are loosened from all bonds of duty--just as if your brain had softened
and you were no longer a responsible being.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>What could Rex say? Inwardly he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was in a state of rebellion, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had
no arguments to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father's; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was feeling, in spite
of any thing that might be said, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) should like to go off to <div class="bookquote">``the
colonies''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to-morrow, it lay in a deep fold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
ought to feel--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had been a better fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) would have felt--more
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) old ties. This is the sort of faith we live by in our soul
sicknesses.

<p/>Rex got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) seat, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) held the conference to be at an end.
<div class="bookquote">``You assent to my arrangement, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, with that
distinct resolution of tone which seems to hold one in a vise.

<p/>There was a little pause before Rex answered, <div class="bookquote">``I'll try what I can do,
sir. I can't promise.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) thought was, that trying would be of no use.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father kept Anna, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) fast, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) wanted to follow
Rex. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) said, the tears coming with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) words when the
door had closed; <div class="bookquote">``it is very hard for him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) look ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will soon be better; it will all blow over. And now, Anna,
be as quiet as a mouse about it all. Never let it be mentioned when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
is gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa. But I would not be like Gwendolen for any thing--to have
people fall in love with me so. It is very dreadful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna dared not say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was disappointed at not being allowed to go
to the colonies with Rex; but that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) secret feeling, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
often afterward went inwardly over the whole affair, saying to herself,
<div class="bookquote">``I should have done with going out, and gloves, and crinoline, and
having to talk when I am taken to dinner--and all that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I like to mark the time, and connect the course of individual lives
with the historic stream, for all classes of thinkers. This was the
period when the broadening of gauge in crinolines seemed to demand an
agitation for the general enlargement of churches, ball-rooms, and
vehicles. But Anna Gascoigne's figure would only allow the size of
skirt manufactured for young ladies of fourteen.




<p/>CHAPTER IX.

<p/>I'll tell thee, Berthold, what men's hopes are like:
A silly child that, quivering with joy,
Would cast its little mimic fishing-line
Baited with loadstone for a bowl of toys
In the salt ocean.


<p/>Eight months after the arrival of the family at Offendene, that is to
say in the end of the following June, a rumor was spread in the
neighborhood which to many persons was matter of exciting interest. It
had no reference to the results of the American war, but it was one
which touched all classes within a certain circuit round Wanchester:
the corn-factors, the brewers, the horse-dealers, and saddlers, all
held it a laudable thing, and one which was to be rejoiced in on
abstract grounds, as showing the value of an aristocracy in a free
country like England; the blacksmith in the hamlet of Diplow felt that
a good time had come round; the wives of laboring men hoped their
nimble boys of ten or twelve would be taken into employ by the
gentlemen in livery; and the farmers about Diplow admitted, with a
tincture of bitterness and reserve, that a man might now again perhaps
have an easier market or exchange for a rick of old hay or a wagon-load
of straw. If such were the hopes of low persons not in society, it may
be easily inferred that their betters had better reasons for
satisfaction, probably connected with the pleasures of life rather than
its business. Marriage, however, must be considered as coming under
both heads; and just as when a visit of majesty is announced, the dream
of knighthood or a baronetcy is to be found under various municipal
nightcaps, so the news in question raised a floating indeterminate
vision of marriage in several well-bred imaginations.

<p/>The news was that Diplow Hall, Sir Hugo Mallinger's place, which had
for a couple of years turned its white window-shutters in a painfully
wall-eyed manner on its fine elms and beeches, its lilied pool and
grassy acres specked with deer, was being prepared for a tenant, and
was for the rest of the summer and through the hunting season to be
inhabited in a fitting style both as to house and stable. But not by
Sir Hugo himself: by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) nephew, Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt, who was
presumptive heir to the baronetcy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) uncle's marriage having produced
nothing but girls. Nor was this the only contingency with which fortune
flattered young Grandcourt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was pleasantly called; for while the
chance of the baronetcy came through his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) father, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mother had given a
baronial streak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) blood, so that if certain intervening persons
slightly painted in the middle distance died, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would become a baron
and peer of this realm.

<p/>It is the uneven allotment of nature that the male bird alone has the
tuft, but we have not yet followed the advice of hasty philosophers who
would have us copy nature entirely in these matters; and if Mr.
Mallinger Grandcourt became a baronet or a peer, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wife would share
the title--which in addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) actual fortune was certainly a
reason why that wife, being at present unchosen, should be thought of
by more than one person with a sympathetic interest as a woman sure to
be well provided for.

<p/>Some readers of this history will doubtless regard it as incredible
that people should construct matrimonial prospects on the mere report
that a bachelor of good fortune and possibilities was coming within
reach, and will reject the statement as a mere outflow of gall: they
will aver that neither they nor their first cousins have minds so
unbridled; and that in fact this is not human nature, which would know
that such speculations might turn out to be fallacious, and would
therefore not entertain them. But, let it be observed, nothing is here
narrated of human nature generally: the history in its present stage
concerns only a few people in a corner of Wessex--whose reputation,
however, was unimpeached, and who, I am in the proud position of being
able to state, were all on visiting terms with persons of rank.

<p/>There were the Arrowpoints, for example, in their beautiful place at
Quetcham: no one could attribute sordid views in relation to their
daughter's marriage to parents who could leave her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) at least half a
million; but having affectionate anxieties about their Catherine's
position -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) having resolutely refused Lord Slogan, an unexceptionable
Irish peer, whose estate wanted nothing but drainage and population-RRB-,
they wondered, perhaps from something more than a charitable impulse,
whether Mr. Grandcourt was good-looking, of sound constitution,
virtuous, or at least reformed, and if liberal-conservative, not too
liberal-conservative; and without wishing anybody to die, thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
succession to the title an event to be desired.

<p/>If the Arrowpoints had such ruminations, it is the less surprising that
they were stimulated in Mr. Gascoigne, who for being a clergyman was
not the less subject to the anxieties of a parent and guardian; and we
have seen how both he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) and Mrs. Gascoigne might by this time have come
to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) was overcharged with the management of young creatures
who were hardly to be held in with bit or bridle, or any sort of
metaphor that would stand for judicious advice.

<p/>Naturally, people did not tell each other all they felt and thought
about young Grandcourt's advent: on no subject is this openness found
prudently practicable--not even on the generation of acids, or the
destination of the fixed stars: for either your contemporary with a
mind turned toward the same subjects may find your ideas ingenious and
forestall you in applying them, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) may have other views on acids and
fixed stars, and think ill of you in consequence. Mr. Gascoigne did not
ask Mr. Arrowpoint if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) had any trustworthy source of information
about Grandcourt considered as a husband for a charming girl; nor did
Mrs. Arrowpoint observe to Mrs. Davilow that if the possible peer
sought a wife in the neighborhood of Diplow, the only reasonable
expectation was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) would offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) hand to Catherine, who,
however, would not accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) were in all respects fitted to
secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) happiness. Indeed, even to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) wife the rector was silent as
to the contemplation of any matrimonial result, from the probability
that Mr. Grandcourt would see Gwendolen at the next Archery Meeting;
though Mrs. Gascoigne's mind was very likely still more active in the
same direction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) had said interjectionally to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``It would
be a mercy, Fanny, if that girl were well married!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>to which Mrs.
Davilow discerning some criticism of her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) darling in the fervor of that
wish, had not chosen to make any audible reply, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had said
inwardly, <div class="bookquote">``You will not get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to marry for your pleasure'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; the mild
mother becoming rather saucy when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) identified herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
daughter.

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband Mrs. Gascoigne said, <div class="bookquote">``I hear Mr. Grandcourt has got two
places of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) comes to Diplow for the hunting. It is to be
hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) will set a good example in the neighborhood. Have you heard
what sort of a young man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, Henry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gascoigne had not heard; at least, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) male acquaintances had
gossiped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) hearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) was not disposed to repeat their gossip, or
to give it any emphasis in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) own mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) held it futile, even if it
had been becoming, to show any curiosity as to the past of a young man
whose birth, wealth, and consequent leisure made many habits venial
which under other circumstances would have been inexcusable. Whatever
Grandcourt had done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had not ruined himself; and it is well-known
that in gambling, for example, whether of the business or holiday sort,
a man who has the strength of mind to leave off when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has only ruined
others, is a reformed character. This is an illustration merely: Mr.
Gascoigne had not heard that Grandcourt had been a gambler; and we can
hardly pronounce him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) singular in feeling that a landed proprietor with
a mixture of noble blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) veins was not to be an object of
suspicious inquiry like a reformed character who offers himself as your
butler or footman. Reformation, where a man can afford to do without
it, can hardly be other than genuine. Moreover, it was not certain on
any other showing hitherto, that Mr. Grandcourt had needed reformation
more than other young men in the ripe youth of five-and-thirty; and, at
any rate, the significance of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had been must be determined by
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) actually was.

<p/>Mrs. Davilow, too, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) would not respond to her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) sister's
pregnant remark, could not be inwardly indifferent to an advent that
might promise a brilliant lot for Gwendolen. A little speculation on
<div class="bookquote">``what may be''  (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>comes naturally, without encouragement--comes inevitably
in the form of images, when unknown persons are mentioned; and Mr.
Grandcourt's name raised in Mrs. Davilow's mind first of all the
picture of a handsome, accomplished, excellent young man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) would
be satisfied with as a husband for her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) daughter; but then came the
further speculation--would Gwendolen be satisfied with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? There was
no knowing what would meet that girl's taste or touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
affections--it might be something else than excellence; and thus the
image of the perfect suitor gave way before a fluctuating combination
of qualities that might be imagined to win Gwendolen's heart. In the
difficulty of arriving at the particular combination which would insure
that result, the mother even said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``It would not signify
about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being in love, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would only accept the right person.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>For whatever marriage had been for herself, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the less
desire it for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter? The difference her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own misfortunes made
was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never dared to dwell much to Gwendolen on the
desirableness of marriage, dreading an answer something like that of
the future Madame Roland, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gentle mother urging the acceptance
of a suitor, said, <div class="bookquote">``Tu seras heureuse, ma chère.''  (<font color='red'><b>a suitor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oui, maman, comme
toi.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>In relation to the problematic Mr. Grandcourt least of all would Mrs.
Davilow have willingly let fall a hint of the aerial castle-building
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had the good taste to be ashamed of; for such a hint was
likely enough to give an adverse poise to Gwendolen's own thought, and
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) detest the desirable husband beforehand. Since that scene
after poor Rex's farewell visit, the mother had felt a new sense of
peril in touching the mystery of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child's feeling, and in rashly
determining what was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) welfare: only she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could think of welfare in no
other shape than marriage.

<p/>The discussion of the dress that Gwendolen was to wear at the Archery
Meeting was a relevant topic, however; and when it had been decided
that as a touch of color on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) white cashmere, nothing, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
complexion, was comparable to pale green--a feather which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
trying in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hat before the looking-glass having settled the
question--Mrs. Davilow felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) ears tingle when Gwendolen, suddenly
throwing herself into the attitude of drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) bow, said with a look
of comic enjoyment--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I pity all the other girls at the Archery Meeting--all thinking of
Mr. Grandcourt! And they have not a shadow of a chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow had not the presence of mind to answer immediately, and
Gwendolen turned round quickly toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), saying, wickedly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you know they have not, mamma. You and my uncle and aunt--you all
intend him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to fall in love with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow, piqued into a little stratagem, said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my, dear, that
is not so certain. Miss Arrowpoint has charms which you have not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, but they demand thought. My arrow will pierce him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
has time for thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will declare himself my slave--I shall send
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) round the world to bring me back the wedding ring of a happy
woman--in the meantime all the men who are between him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) and the title
will die of different diseases--he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will come back Lord Grandcourt--but
without the ring--and fall at my feet. I shall laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will
rise in resentment--I shall laugh more--he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will call for his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) steed and
ride to Quetcham, where he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will find Miss Arrowpoint just married to a
needy musician, Mrs. Arrowpoint tearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) cap off, and Mr. Arrowpoint
standing by. Exit Lord Grandcourt, who returns to Diplow, and, like M.
Jabot, _change de linge_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>any witch</b></font>)</div><p/>Was ever any young witch like this? You thought of hiding things from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)--sat upon your secret and looked innocent, and all the while she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
knew by the corner of your eye that it was exactly five pounds ten you
were sitting on! As well turn the key to keep out the damp! It was
probable that by dint of divination she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) already knew more than any one
else did of Mr. Grandcourt. That idea in Mrs. Davilow's mind prompted
the sort of question which often comes without any other apparent
reason than the faculty of speech and the not knowing what to do with
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what kind of a man do you imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be, Gwendolen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see!''  (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>said the witch, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) forefinger to her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) lips, with
a little frown, and then stretching out the finger with decision.
<div class="bookquote">``Short--just above my shoulder--trying to make himself tall by turning
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) mustache and keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) beard long--a glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) right eye to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) an air of distinction--a strong opinion about his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) waistcoat,
but uncertain and trimming about the weather, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) will try to
draw me out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) will stare at me all the while, and the glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>)
eye will cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) to make horrible faces, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) smiles in
a flattering way. I shall cast down my eyes in consequence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) will
perceive that I am not indifferent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) attentions. I shall dream
that night that I am looking at the extraordinary face of a magnified
insect--and the next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) will make an offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) hand; the
sequel as before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a portrait of some one you have seen already, Gwen. Mr.
Grandcourt may be a delightful young man for what you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a high note of careless admission,
taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) best hat and turning it round on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand
contemplatively. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what sort of behavior a delightful young man
would have? I know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have hunters and racers, and a London house
and two country-houses--one with battlements and another with a
veranda. And I feel sure that with a little murdering he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might get a
title.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The irony of this speech was of the doubtful sort that has some genuine
belief mixed up with it. Poor Mrs. Davilow felt uncomfortable under it.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) own meanings being usually literal and in intention innocent; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) said with a distressed brow:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk in that way, child, for heaven's sake! you do read such
books--they give you such ideas of everything. I declare when your aunt
and I were your age we knew nothing about wickedness. I think it was
better so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you not bring me up in that way, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. But
immediately perceiving in the crushed look and rising sob that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
given a deep wound, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tossed down her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hat and knelt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's
feet crying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, mamma! I was only speaking in fun. I meant nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I, Gwendolen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said poor Mrs. Davilow, unable to hear the
retraction, and sobbing violently while she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) made the effort to speak.
<div class="bookquote">``Your will was always too strong for me--if everything else had been
different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>This disjoined logic was intelligible enough to the daughter. <div class="bookquote">``Dear
mamma, I don't find fault with you--I love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, really
compunctious. <div class="bookquote">``How can you help what I am? Besides, I am very charming.
Come, now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Here Gwendolen with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) handkerchief gently rubbed away her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mother's tears. <div class="bookquote">``Really--I am contented with myself. I like myself
better than I should have liked my aunt and you. How dreadfully dull
you must have been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Such tender cajolery served to quiet the mother, as it had often done
before after like collisions. Not that the collisions had often been
repeated at the same point; for in the memory of both they left an
association of dread with the particular topics which had occasioned
them: Gwendolen dreaded the unpleasant sense of compunction toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mother, which was the nearest approach to self-condemnation and
self-distrust that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had known; and Mrs. Davilow's timid maternal
conscience dreaded whatever had brought on the slightest hint of
reproach. Hence, after this little scene, the two concurred in
excluding Mr. Grandcourt from their conversation.

<p/>When Mr. Gascoigne once or twice referred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>), Mrs. Davilow feared
least Gwendolen should betray some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) alarming keen-sightedness
about what was probably in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle's mind; but the fear was not
justified. Gwendolen knew certain differences in the characters with
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was concerned as birds know climate and weather; and for the
very reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was determined to evade her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle's control, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was determined not to clash with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). The good understanding between
them was much fostered by their enjoyment of archery together: Mr.
Gascoigne, as one of the best bowmen in Wessex, was gratified to find
the elements of like skill in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) niece; and Gwendolen was the more
careful not to lose the shelter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) fatherly indulgence, because
since the trouble with Rex both Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna had been unable
to hide what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) felt to be a very unreasonable alienation from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>).
Toward Anna she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took some pains to behave with a regretful
affectionateness; but neither of them dared to mention Rex's name, and
Anna, to whom the thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was part of the air she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) breathed, was
ill at ease with the lively cousin who had ruined his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
tried dutifully to repress any sign of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) changed feeling; but who in
pain can imitate the glance and hand-touch of pleasure.

<p/>This unfair resentment had rather a hardening effect on Gwendolen, and
threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) into a more defiant temper. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle too might be offended
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) refused the next person who fell in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and one day
when that idea was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, I see now why girls are glad to be married--to escape being
expected to please everybody but themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Happily, Mr. Middleton was gone without having made any avowal; and
notwithstanding the admiration for the handsome Miss Harleth, extending
perhaps over thirty square miles in a part of Wessex well studded with
families whose numbers included several disengaged young men, each glad
to seat himself by the lively girl with whom it was so easy to get on
in conversation,--notwithstanding these grounds for arguing that
Gwendolen was likely to have other suitors more explicit than the
cautious curate, the fact was not so.

<p/>Care has been taken not only that the trees should not sweep the stars
down, but also that every man who admires a fair girl should not be
enamored of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and even that every man who is enamored should not
necessarily declare himself. There are various refined shapes in which
the price of corn, known to be potent cause in their relation, might,
if inquired into, show why a young lady, perfect in person,
accomplishments, and costume, has not the trouble of rejecting many
offers; and nature's order is certainly benignant in not obliging us
one and all to be desperately in love with the most admirable mortal we
have ever seen. Gwendolen, we know, was far from holding that supremacy
in the minds of all observers. Besides, it was but a poor eight months
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had come to Offendene, and some inclinations become manifest
slowly, like the sunward creeping of plants.

<p/>In face of this fact that not one of the eligible young men already in
the neighborhood had made Gwendolen an offer, why should Mr. Grandcourt
be thought of as likely to do what they had left undone?

<p/>Perhaps because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was thought of as still more eligible; since a great
deal of what passes for likelihood in the world is simply the reflex of
a wish. Mr. and Mrs. Arrowpoint, for example, having no anxiety that
Miss Harleth should make a brilliant marriage, had quite a different
likelihood in their minds.




<p/>CHAPTER X.

<p/>_1st Gent._ What woman should be? Sir, consult the taste
Of marriageable men. This planet's store
In iron, cotton, wool, or chemicals--
All matter rendered to our plastic skill,
Is wrought in shapes responsive to demand;
The market's pulse makes index high or low,
By rule sublime. Our daughters must be wives,
And to the wives must be what men will choose;
Men's taste is woman's test. You mark the phrase?
``Tis good, I think?--the sense well-winged and poised
With t's and s's.
_2nd Gent._ Nay, but turn it round;
Give us the test of taste. A fine _menu_--
Is it to-day what Roman epicures
Insisted that a gentleman must eat
To earn the dignity of dining well?


<p/>Brackenshaw Park, where the Archery Meeting was held, looked out from
its gentle heights far over the neighboring valley to the outlying
eastern downs and the broad, slow rise of cultivated country, hanging
like a vast curtain toward the west. The castle which stood on the
highest platform of the clustered hills, was built of rough-hewn
limestone, full of lights and shadows made by the dark dust of lichens
and the washings of the rain. Masses of beech and fir sheltered it on
the north, and spread down here and there along the green slopes like
flocks seeking the water which gleamed below. The archery-ground was a
carefully-kept enclosure on a bit of table-land at the farthest end of
the park, protected toward the southwest by tall elms and a thick
screen of hollies, which kept the gravel walk and the bit of newly-mown
turf where the targets were placed in agreeable afternoon shade. The
Archery Hall with an arcade in front showed like a white temple against
the greenery on the north side.

<p/>What could make a better background for the flower-groups of ladies,
moving and bowing and turning their necks as it would become the
leisurely lilies to do if they took to locomotion. The sounds too were
very pleasant to hear, even when the military band from Wanchester
ceased to play: musical laughs in all the registers and a harmony of
happy, friendly speeches, now rising toward mild excitement, now
sinking to an agreeable murmur.

<p/>No open-air amusement could be much freer from those noisy, crowding
conditions which spoil most modern pleasures; no Archery Meeting could
be more select, the number of friends accompanying the members being
restricted by an award of tickets, so as to keep the maximum within the
limits of convenience for the dinner and ball to be held in the castle.
Within the enclosure no plebeian spectators were admitted except Lord
Brackenshaw's tenants and their families, and of these it was chiefly
the feminine members who used the privilege, bringing their little boys
and girls or younger brothers and sisters. The males among them
relieved the insipidity of the entertainment by imaginative betting, in
which the stake was <div class="bookquote">``anything you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>The males</b></font>)</div>on their favorite archers; but
the young maidens, having a different principle of discrimination, were
considering which of those sweetly-dressed ladies they would choose to
be, if the choice were allowed them. Probably the form these rural
souls would most have striven for as a tabernacle, was some other than
Gwendolen's--one with more pink in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cheeks and hair of the most
fashionable yellow; but among the male judges in the ranks immediately
surrounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) there was unusual unanimity in pronouncing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) the
finest girl present.

<p/>No wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) existence on that July day. Pre-eminence is
sweet to those who love it, even under mediocre circumstances. Perhaps
it was not quite mythical that a slave has been proud to be bought
first; and probably a barn-door fowl on sale, though he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) may not have
understood himself to be called the best of a bad lot, may have a
self-informed consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) relative importance, and strut
consoled. But for complete enjoyment the outward and the inward must
concur. And that concurrence was happening to Gwendolen.

<p/>Who can deny that bows and arrows are among the prettiest weapons in
the world for feminine forms to play with? They prompt attitudes full
of grace and power, where that fine concentration of energy seen in all
markmanship, is freed from associations of bloodshed. The time-honored
British resource of <div class="bookquote">``killing something''  (<font color='red'><b>bands</b></font>)</div>is no longer carried on with
bow and quiver; bands defending their passes against an invading nation
fight under another sort of shade than a cloud of arrows; and poisoned
darts are harmless survivals either in rhetoric or in regions
comfortably remote. Archery has no ugly smell of brimstone; breaks
nobody's shins, breeds no athletic monsters; its only danger is that of
failing, which for generous blood is enough to mould skilful action.
And among the Brackenshaw archers the prizes were all of the nobler
symbolic kind; not properly to be carried off in a parcel, degrading
honor into gain; but the gold arrow and the silver, the gold star and
the silver, to be worn for a long time in sign of achievement and then
transferred to the next who did excellently. These signs of
pre-eminence had the virtue of wreaths without their inconveniences,
which might have produced a melancholy effect in the heat of the
ball-room. Altogether the Brackenshaw Archery Club was an institution
framed with good taste, so as not to have by necessity any ridiculous
incidents.

<p/>And to-day all incalculable elements were in its favor. There was mild
warmth, and no wind to disturb either hair or drapery or the course of
the arrow; all skillful preparation had fair play, and when there was a
general march to extract the arrows, the promenade of joyous young
creatures in light speech and laughter, the graceful movement in common
toward a common object, was a show worth looking at. Here Gwendolen
seemed a Calypso among her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nymphs. It was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) attitudes and
movements that every one was obliged to admit her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) surpassing charm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That girl is like a high-mettled racer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Brackenshaw/Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div>said Lord Brackenshaw to
young Clintock, one of the invited spectators.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First chop! tremendously pretty too,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the elegant Grecian, who
had been paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) assiduous attention; <div class="bookquote">``I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) look better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never looked so well. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face was beaming with young
pleasure in which there was no malign rays of discontent; for being
satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own chances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt kindly toward everybody and
was satisfied with the universe. Not to have the highest distinction in
rank, not to be marked out as an heiress, like Miss Arrowpoint, gave an
added triumph in eclipsing those advantages. For personal
recommendation she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) would not have cared to change the family group
accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) for any other: her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) mamma's appearance would have
suited an amiable duchess; her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) uncle and aunt Gascoigne with Anna made
equally gratifying figures in their way; and Gwendolen was too full of
joyous belief in herself to feel in the least jealous though Miss
Arrowpoint was one of the best archeresses.

<p/>Even the reappearance of the formidable Herr Klesmer, which caused some
surprise in the rest of the company, seemed only to fall in with
Gwendolen's inclination to be amused. Short of Apollo himself, what
great musical _maestro_ could make a good figure at an archery meeting?
There was a very satirical light in Gwendolen's eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked
toward the Arrowpoint party on their first entrance, when the contrast
between Klesmer and the average group of English country people seemed
at its utmost intensity in the close neighborhood of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) hosts--or
patrons, as Mrs. Arrowpoint would have liked to hear them called, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) might deny the possibility of any longer patronizing genius, its
royalty being universally acknowledged. The contrast might have amused
a graver personage than Gwendolen. We English are a miscellaneous
people, and any chance fifty of us will present many varieties of
animal architecture or facial ornament; but it must be admitted that
our prevailing expression is not that of a lively, impassioned race,
preoccupied with the ideal and carrying the real as a mere make-weight.
The strong point of the English gentleman pure is the easy style of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
figure and clothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) objects to marked ins and outs in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) costume,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) also objects to looking inspired.

<p/>Fancy an assemblage where the men had all that ordinary stamp of the
well-bred Englishman, watching the entrance of Herr Klesmer--his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) mane
of hair floating backward in massive inconsistency with the chimney-pot
hat, which had the look of having been put on for a joke above his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
pronounced but well-modeled features and powerful clear-shaven mouth
and chin; his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) tall, thin figure clad in a way which, not being strictly
English, was all the worse for its apparent emphasis of intention.
Draped in a loose garment with a Florentine _berretta_ on his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
would have been fit to stand by the side of Leonardo de Vinci; but how
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) presented himself in trousers which were not what English
feeling demanded about the knees?--and when the fire that showed itself
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) glances and the movements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) head, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>) looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonardo</b></font>)
with curiosity, was turned into comedy by a hat which ruled that
mankind should have well-cropped hair and a staid demeanor, such, for
example, as Mr. Arrowsmith's, whose nullity of face and perfect
tailoring might pass everywhere without ridicule? One feels why it is
often better for greatness to be dead, and to have got rid of the
outward man.

<p/>Many present knew Klesmer, or knew of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but they had only seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
on candle-light occasions when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared simply as a musician, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had not yet that supreme, world-wide celebrity which makes an artist
great to the most ordinary people by their knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) great
expensiveness. It was literally a new light for them to see him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>)
in--presented unexpectedly on this July afternoon in an exclusive
society: some were inclined to laugh, others felt a little disgust at
the want of judgment shown by the Arrowpoints in this use of an
introductory card.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What extreme guys those artistic fellows usually are?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clintock/Mr. Clintock</b></font>)</div>said young
Clintock to Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``Do look at the figure he (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) cuts, bowing with his (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>)
hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) heart to Lady Brackenshaw--and Mrs. Arrowpoint's feather
just reaching his (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) shoulder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are one of the profane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``You are blind to the
majesty of genius. Herr Klesmer smites me with awe; I feel crushed in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) presence; my courage all oozes from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you understand all about his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a light laugh; <div class="bookquote">``it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) who
understands all about mine and thinks it pitiable.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Klesmer's verdict
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) singing had been an easier joke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had been struck
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) _plastik_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not addressed to the ears of the future, I suppose. I'm glad of
that: it suits mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are very kind. But how remarkably well Miss Arrowpoint looks
to-day! She (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) would make quite a fine picture in that gold-colored dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too splendid, don't you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps a little too symbolical--too much like the figure of
Wealth in an allegory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>This speech of Gwendolen's had rather a malicious sound, but it was not
really more than a bubble of fun. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not wish Miss Arrowpoint or
any one else to be out of the way, believing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own good fortune
even more than in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) skill. The belief in both naturally grew stronger
as the shooting went on, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) promised to achieve one of the best
scores--a success which astonished every one in a new member; and to
Gwendolen's temperament one success determined another. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) trod on
air, and all things pleasant seemed possible. The hour was enough for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not obliged to think what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should do next to keep
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life at the due pitch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How does the scoring stand, I wonder?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div>said Lady Brackenshaw, a
gracious personage who, adorned with two little girls and a boy of
stout make, sat as lady paramount. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord had come up to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in one
of the intervals of shooting. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that Miss Harleth is
likely to win the gold arrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gad, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) will, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) carries it on! she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) is running Juliet
Fenn hard. It is wonderful for one in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) first year. Catherine is not
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) usual mark,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship, turning to the heiress's
mother who sat near. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) got the gold arrow last time. And there's
a luck even in these games of skill. That's better. It gives the hinder
ones a chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine will be very glad for others to win,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint,
``she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is so magnanimous. It was entirely her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) considerateness that made
us bring Herr Klesmer instead of Canon Stopley, who had expressed a
wish to come. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own pleasure, I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would rather have
brought the Canon; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is always thinking of others. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) it
was not quite _en règle_ to bring one so far out of our own set; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, ``Genius itself is not _en règle_; it comes into the world to
make new rules.<div class="bookquote">'' And one must admit that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Genius</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Brackenshaw/Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div>said Lord Brackenshaw, in a tone of careless
dismissal, adding quickly, <div class="bookquote">``For my part, I am not magnanimous; I should
like to win. But, confound it! I never have the chance now. I'm getting
old and idle. The young ones beat me. As old Nestor says--the gods
don't give us everything at one time: I was a young fellow once, and
now I am getting an old and wise one. Old, at any rate; which is a gift
that comes to everybody if they live long enough, so it raises no
jealousy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Brackenshaw/Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div>The Earl smiled comfortably at his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my lord, people who have been neighbors twenty years must not talk
to each other about age,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint. <div class="bookquote">``Years, as the Tuscans
say, are made for the letting of houses. But where is our new neighbor?
I thought Mr. Grandcourt was to be here to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, by the way, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was. The time's getting on too,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>)
lordship, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) only got to Diplow the other
day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) came to us on Tuesday and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had been a little bothered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) may have been pulled in another direction. Why, Gascoigne!'' (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>--the
rector was just then crossing at a little distance with Gwendolen on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) arm, and turned in compliance with the call--<div class="bookquote">``this is a little too
bad; you not only beat us yourself, but you bring up your niece to beat
all the archeresses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It _is_ rather scandalous in her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to get the better of elder members,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, with much inward satisfaction curling his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) short
upper lip. <div class="bookquote">``But it is not my doing, my lord. I only meant her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to make a
tolerable figure, without surpassing any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not my fault, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with pretty archness. <div class="bookquote">``If
I am to aim, I can't help hitting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, that may be a fatal business for some people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Brackenshaw/Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div>said Lord
Brackenshaw, good-humoredly; then taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) watch and looking at
Mrs. Arrowpoint again--<div class="bookquote">``The time's getting on, as you say. But
Grandcourt is always late. I notice in town he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)'s always late, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)'s
no bowman--understands nothing about it. But I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) must come;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would see the flower of the neighborhood here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) asked about
you--had seen Arrowpoint's card. I think you had not made his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
acquaintance in town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) has been a good deal abroad. People don't know
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; we are strangers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint. <div class="bookquote">``But that is not what
might have been expected. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) uncle Sir Hugo Mallinger and I are
great friends when we meet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know; uncles and nephews are not so likely to be seen together
as uncles and nieces,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) lordship, smiling toward the rector.
<div class="bookquote">``But just come with me one instant, Gascoigne, will you? I want to
speak a word about the clout-shooting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen chose to go too and be deposited in the same group with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mamma and aunt until she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had to shoot again. That Mr. Grandcourt might
after all not appear on the archery-ground, had begun to enter into
Gwendolen's thought as a possible deduction from the completeness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pleasure. Under all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saucy satire, provoked chiefly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
divination that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) friends thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) as a desirable match for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt something very far from indifference as to the impression
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would make on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). True, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was not to have the slightest power
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) -LRB-for Gwendolen had not considered that the desire to conquer
is itself a sort of subjection-RRB-; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was
to be one of those complimentary and assiduously admiring men of whom
even her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) narrow experience had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) several with various-colored
beards and various styles of bearing; and the sense that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) friends
would want her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to think him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) delightful, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) a resistant
inclination to presuppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) ridiculous. But that was no reason why
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could spare his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) presence: and even a passing prevision of trouble
in case she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) despised and refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), raised not the shadow of a wish
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should save her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that trouble by showing no disposition to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) an offer. Mr. Grandcourt taking hardly any notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and
becoming shortly engaged to Miss Arrowpoint, was not a picture which
flattered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination.

<p/>Hence Gwendolen had been all ear to Lord Brackenshaw's mode of
accounting for Grandcourt's non-appearance; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did arrive, no
consciousness--not even Mrs. Arrowpoint's or Mr. Gascoigne's--was more
awake to the fact than hers, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) steadily avoided looking
toward any point where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) was likely to be. There should be no
slightest shifting of angles to betray that it was of any consequence
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) whether the much-talked-of Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt presented
himself or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) became again absorbed in the shooting, and so
resolutely abstained from looking round observantly that, even
supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to have taken a conspicuous place among the spectators,
it might be clear she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) was not aware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). And all the while the
certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was there made a distinct thread in her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>)
consciousness. Perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) shooting was the better for it: at any rate,
it gained in precision, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) at last raised a delightful storm of
clapping and applause by three hits running in the gold--a feat which
among the Brackenshaw archers had not the vulgar reward of a shilling
poll-tax, but that of a special gold star to be worn on the breast.
That moment was not only a happy one to herself--it was just what her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>)
mamma and her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) uncle would have chosen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>). There was a general
falling into ranks to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) space that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) might advance
conspicuously to receive the gold star from the hands of Lady
Brackenshaw; and the perfect movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) fine form was certainly a
pleasant thing to behold in the clear afternoon light when the shadows
were long and still. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) was the central object of that pretty picture,
and every one present must gaze at her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>). That was enough: she (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) herself
was determined to see nobody in particular, or to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) eyes any way
except toward Lady Brackenshaw, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) thoughts undeniably turned in
other ways. It entered a little into her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) pleasure that Herr Klesmer
must be observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) at a moment when music was out of the question,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) superiority very far in the back-ground; for vanity is as ill
at ease under indifference as tenderness is under a love which it
cannot return; and the unconquered Klesmer threw a trace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) malign
power even across her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) pleasant consciousness that Mr. Grandcourt was
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) to the utmost advantage, and was probably giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) an
admiration unmixed with criticism. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) did not expect to admire _him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)_,
but that was not necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) peace of mind.

<p/>Gwendolen met Lady Brackenshaw's gracious smile without blushing -LRB-which
only came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was taken by surprise-RRB-, but with a charming
gladness of expression, and then bent with easy grace to have the star
fixed near her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) shoulder. That little ceremony had been over long enough
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to have exchanged playful speeches and received congratulations
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) moved among the groups who were now interesting themselves in
the results of the scoring; but it happened that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stood outside
examining the point of an arrow with rather an absent air when Lord
Brackenshaw came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Harleth, here is a gentleman who is not willing to wait any
longer for an introduction. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has been getting Mrs. Davilow to send me
with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Will you allow me to introduce Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt?''




 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Brackenshaw/Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div><p/>BOOK II--MEETING STREAMS.


<p/>CHAPTER XI.

<p/>The beginning of an acquaintance whether with persons or things is to
get a definite outline for our ignorance.


<p/>Mr. Grandcourt's wish to be introduced had no suddenness for Gwendolen;
but when Lord Brackenshaw moved aside a little for the prefigured
stranger to come forward and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt herself face to face with the
real man, there was a little shock which flushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cheeks and
vexatiously deepened with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consciousness of it. The shock came from
the reversal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) expectations: Grandcourt could hardly have been
more unlike all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imaginary portraits of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was slightly taller
than herself, and their eyes seemed to be on a level; there was not the
faintest smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), not a trace of
self-consciousness or anxiety in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) bearing: when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hat he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
showed an extensive baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of
reddish-blonde hair, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) also showed a perfect hand; the line of
feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome,
with only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight
whisker too was perpendicular. It was not possible for a human aspect
to be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings: also it was perhaps
not possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated. The
correct Englishman, drawing himself up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) bow into rigidity,
assenting severely, and seemed to be in a state of internal drill,
suggests a suppressed vivacity, and may be suspected of letting go with
some violence when he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) is released from parade; but Grandcourt's bearing
had no rigidity, it inclined rather to the flaccid. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) complexion had
a faded fairness resembling that of an actress when bare of the
artificial white and red; his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) long narrow gray eyes expressed nothing
but indifference. Attempts at description are stupid: who can all at
once describe a human being? even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is presented to us we only
begin that knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) appearance which must be completed by
innumerable impressions under differing circumstances. We recognize the
alphabet; we are not sure of the language. I am only mentioning the
point that Gwendolen saw by the light of a prepared contrast in the
first minutes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meeting with Grandcourt: they were summed up in
the words, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is not ridiculous.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>But forthwith Lord Brackenshaw was
gone, and what is called conversation had begun, the first and constant
element in it being that Grandcourt looked at Gwendolen persistently
with a slightly exploring gaze, but without change of expression, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) only occasionally looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) with a flash of observation a
little softened by coquetry. Also, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) answers there was a longer
or shorter pause before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) spoke again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to think archery was a great bore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>Grandcourt began. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) spoke
with a fine accent, but with a certain broken drawl, as of a
distinguished personage with a distinguished cold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) chest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you converted to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.

<p/>-LRB-Pause, during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagined various degrees and modes of opinion
about herself that might be entertained by Grandcourt.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, since I saw you shooting. In things of this sort one generally
sees people missing and simpering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you are a first-rate shot with a rifle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Pause, during which Gwendolen, having taken a rapid observation of
Grandcourt, made a brief graphic description of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to an indefinite
hearer.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have left off shooting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh then you are a formidable person. People who have done things once
and left them off make one feel very contemptible, as if one were using
cast-off fashions. I hope you have not left off all follies, because I
practice a great many.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Pause, during which Gwendolen made several interpretations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own
speech.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you call follies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, in general I think, whatever is agreeable is called a folly. But
you have not left off hunting, I hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Pause, wherein Gwendolen recalled what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had heard about
Grandcourt's position, and decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was the most
aristocratic-looking man she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had ever seen.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One must do something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you care about the turf?--or is that among the things you have
left off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Pause, during which Gwendolen thought that a man of extremely calm,
cold manners might be less disagreeable as a husband than other men,
and not likely to interfere with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's preferences.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I run a horse now and then; but I don't go in for the thing as some
men do. Are you fond of horses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed: I never like my life so well as when I am on horseback,
having a great gallop. I think of nothing. I only feel myself strong
and happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Pause, wherein Gwendolen wondered whether Grandcourt would like what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, but assured herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not going to disguise her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
tastes.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like danger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. When I am on horseback I never think of danger. It seems
to me that if I broke my bones I should not feel it. I should go at
anything that came in my way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Pause during which Gwendolen had run through a whole hunting season
with two chosen hunters to ride at will.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would perhaps like tiger-hunting or pig-sticking. I saw some of
that for a season or two in the East. Everything here is poor stuff
after that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_You_ are fond of danger, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Pause, wherein Gwendolen speculated on the probability that the men of
coldest manners were the most adventurous, and felt the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
own insight, supposing the question had to be decided.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One must have something or other. But one gets used to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to think I am very fortunate, because everything is new to me:
it is only that I can't get enough of it. I am not used to anything
except being dull, which I should like to leave off as you have left
off shooting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Pause, during which it occurred to Gwendolen that a man of cold and
distinguished manners might possibly be a dull companion; but on the
other hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought that most persons were dull, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not
observed husbands to be companions--and that after all she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not
going to accept Grandcourt.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you dull?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a dreadful neighborhood. There is nothing to be done in it.
That is why I practiced my archery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Pause, during which Gwendolen reflected that the life of an unmarried
woman who could not go about and had no command of anything must
necessarily be dull through all degrees of comparison as time went on.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have made yourself queen of it. I imagine you will carry the first
prize.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that. I have great rivals. Did you not observe how well
Miss Arrowpoint shot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Pause, wherein Gwendolen was thinking that men had been known to
choose some one else than the woman they most admired, and recalled
several experiences of that kind in novels.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Arrowpoint. No--that is, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go now and hear what the scoring says? Every one is going to
the other end now--shall we join them? I think my uncle is looking
toward me. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) perhaps wants me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen found a relief for herself by thus changing the situation:
not that the _tete-à-tete_ was quite disagreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); but while it
lasted she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) apparently could not get rid of the unwonted flush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
cheeks and the sense of surprise which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feel less mistress of
herself than usual. And this Mr. Grandcourt, who seemed to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own
importance more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did hers--a sort of unreasonableness few of us
can tolerate--must not take for granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was of great moment to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), or that because others speculated on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) as a desirable match she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
held herself altogether at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) beck. How Grandcourt had filled up the
pauses will be more evident hereafter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have just missed the gold arrow, Gwendolen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne.
<div class="bookquote">``Miss Juliet Fenn scores eight above you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to hear it. I should have felt that I was making myself
too disagreeable--taking the best of everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, quite
easily.

<p/>It was impossible to be jealous of Juliet Fenn, a girl as middling as
mid-day market in everything but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenn</b></font>) archery and plainness, in which
last she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenn</b></font>) was noticeable like her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenn</b></font>) father: underhung and with receding
brow resembling that of the more intelligent fishes. -LRB-Surely,
considering the importance which is given to such an accident in female
offspring, marriageable men, or what the new English calls <div class="bookquote">``intending
bridegrooms,''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>should look at themselves dispassionately in the glass,
since their natural selection of a mate prettier than themselves is not
certain to bar the effect of their own ugliness.-RRB-

<p/>There was now a lively movement in the mingling groups, which carried
the talk along with it. Every one spoke to every one else by turns, and
Gwendolen, who chose to see what was going on around her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) now, observed
that Grandcourt was having Klesmer presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) by some one unknown
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--a middle-aged man, with dark, full face and fat hands, who
seemed to be on the easiest terms with both, and presently led the way
in joining the Arrowpoints, whose acquaintance had already been made by
both him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) and Grandcourt. Who this stranger was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not care much to
know; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wished to observe what was Grandcourt's manner toward
others than herself. Precisely the same: except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not look
much at Miss Arrowpoint, but rather at Klesmer, who was speaking with
animation--now stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) long fingers horizontally, now
pointing downward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) fore-finger, now folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) arms and
tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mane, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) addressed himself first to one and then to
the other, including Grandcourt, who listened with an impassive face
and narrow eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) left fore-finger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
right slightly touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thin whisker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder which style Miss Arrowpoint admires most,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>was a thought that
glanced through Gwendolen's mind, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes and lips gathered
rather a mocking expression. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would not indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sense of
amusement by watching, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were curious, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gave all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
animation to those immediately around her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), determined not to care
whether Mr. Grandcourt came near her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) again or not.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did come, however, and at a moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could propose to
conduct Mrs. Davilow to her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) carriage, <div class="bookquote">``Shall we meet again in the
ball-room?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hat at parting. The <div class="bookquote">``yes''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in
reply had the usual slight drawl and perfect gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were wrong for once Gwendolen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, during their
few minutes' drive to the castle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Mr. Grandcourt's appearance and manners. You can't find anything
ridiculous in him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I could if I tried, but I don't want to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, rather pettishly; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother was afraid to say more.

<p/>It was the rule on these occasions for the ladies and gentlemen to dine
apart, so that the dinner might make a time of comparative ease and
rest for both. Indeed, the gentlemen had a set of archery stories about
the epicurism of the ladies, who had somehow been reported to show a
revolting masculine judgment in venison, even asking for the fat--a
proof of the frightful rate at which corruption might go on in women,
but for severe social restraint, and every year the amiable Lord
Brackenshaw, who was something of a _gourmet_, mentioned Byron's
opinion that a woman should never be seen eating,--introducing it with
a confidential--<div class="bookquote">``The fact is''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) were for the first time
admitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) concurrence in that sentiment of the refined poet.

<p/>In the ladies' dining-room it was evident that Gwendolen was not a
general favorite with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own sex: there were no beginnings of intimacy
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and other girls, and in conversation they rather noticed
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said than spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in free exchange. Perhaps it was that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not much interested in them, and when left alone in their
company had a sense of empty benches. Mrs. Vulcany once remarked that
Miss Harleth was too fond of the gentlemen; but we know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) was
not in the least fond of them--she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) was only fond of their homage--and
women did not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) homage. The exception to this willing aloofness
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) was Miss Arrowpoint, who often managed unostentatiously to be
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) side, and talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) with quiet friendliness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knows, as I do, that our friends are ready to quarrel over a
husband for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>thought Gwendolen, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) is determined not to enter
into the quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Miss Arrowpoint has the best manners I ever saw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Davilow, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) and Gwendolen were in a dressing-room with Mrs.
Gascoigne and Anna, but at a distance where they could have their talk
apart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I were like her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? Are you getting discontented with yourself, Gwen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I am discontented with things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwen</b></font>) seems contented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you ought to be satisfied to-day. You must have enjoyed the
shooting. I saw you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that is over now, and I don't know what will come next,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, stretching herself with a sort of moan and throwing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
arms. They were bare now; it was the fashion to dance in the archery
dress, throwing off the jacket; and the simplicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) white
cashmere with its border of pale green set off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) form to the utmost.
A thin line of gold round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck, and the gold star on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) breast,
were her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) only ornaments. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) smooth soft hair piled up into a grand
crown made a clear line about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brow. Sir Joshua would have been glad
to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) portrait; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) would have had an easier task than the
historian at least in this, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) would not have had to represent the
truth of change--only to give stability to one beautiful moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dancing will come next,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow <div class="bookquote">``You are sure to enjoy
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall only dance in the quadrille. I told Mr. Clintock so. I shall
not waltz or polk with any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why in the world do you say that all on a sudden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear having ugly people so near me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom do you mean by ugly people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, plenty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Clintock, for example, is not ugly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Davilow dared not
mention Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hate woolen cloth touching me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow to her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) sister who now came up from the other
end of the room. <div class="bookquote">``Gwendolen says she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) will not waltz or polk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) is rather given to whims, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne, gravely.
<div class="bookquote">``It would be more becoming in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to behave as other young ladies do on
such an occasion as this; especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) has had the advantage of
first-rate dancing lessons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I dance if I don't like it, aunt? It is not in the
catechism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My _dear_!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne, in a tone of severe check, and Anna
looked frightened at Gwendolen's daring. But they all passed on without
saying any more.

<p/>Apparently something had changed Gwendolen's mood since the hour of
exulting enjoyment in the archery-ground. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not look the
worse under the chandeliers in the ball-room, where the soft splendor
of the scene and the pleasant odors from the conservatory could not but
be soothing to the temper, when accompanied with the consciousness of
being preeminently sought for. Hardly a dancing man but was anxious to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) for a partner, and each whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) accepted was in a state of
melancholy remonstrance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would not waltz or polk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you under a vow, Miss Harleth?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Why are you so cruel to us
all?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``You waltzed with me in February.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``And you who waltz so
perfectly!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>were exclamations not without piquancy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). The ladies
who waltzed naturally thought that Miss Harleth only wanted to make
herself particular; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) overheard her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) refusal
supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) by saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gwendolen has usually good reasons.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was certainly more
distinguished in not waltzing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to be distinguished.
The archery ball was intended to be kept at the subdued pitch that
suited all dignities clerical and secular; it was not an escapement for
youthful high spirits, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) himself was of opinion that the
fashionable dances were too much of a romp.

<p/>Among the remonstrant dancing men, however, Mr. Grandcourt was not
numbered. After standing up for a quadrille with Miss Arrowpoint, it
seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) meant to ask for no other partner. Gwendolen observed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) frequently with the Arrowpoints, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) never took an opportunity
of approaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Mr. Gascoigne was sometimes speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>); but
Mr. Gascoigne was everywhere. It was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would
probably after all not have the least trouble about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>): perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) had
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) without any particular admiration, and was too much used
to everything in the world to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as more than one of the
girls who were invited in that part of the country. Of course! It was
ridiculous of elders to entertain notions about what a man would do,
without having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even through a telescope. Probably he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant to
marry Miss Arrowpoint. Whatever might come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), Gwendolen, was not
going to be disappointed: the affair was a joke whichever way it
turned, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never committed herself even by a silent confidence
in anything Mr. Grandcourt would do. Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did
sometimes quietly and gradually change his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) position according to hers,
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was dancing, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not
admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--so much the worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/>This movement for the sake of being in sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was more direct
than usual rather late in the evening, when Gwendolen had accepted
Klesmer as a partner; and that wide-glancing personage, who saw
everything and nothing by turns, said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) when they were walking,
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grandcourt is a man of taste. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) likes to see you dancing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>personage</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) likes to look at what is against his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, with a light laugh; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was quite courageous with Klesmer
now. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) may be so tired of admiring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) likes disgust for variety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those words are not suitable to your lips,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, quickly,
with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) grand frowns, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) hand as if to banish
the discordant sounds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you as critical of words as of music?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I am. I should require your words to be what your face and
form are--always among the meanings of a noble music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a compliment as well as a correction. I am obliged for both.
But do you know I am bold enough to wish to correct _you_, and require
you to understand a joke?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One may understand jokes without liking them,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the terrible
Klesmer. ``I have had opera books sent me full of jokes; it was just
because I understood them that I did not like them. The comic people
are ready to challenge a man because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks grave. ``You don't see the
witticism, sir?'' ``No, sir, but I see what you meant.<div class="bookquote">'' Then I am what we
call ticketed as a fellow without _esprit_. But, in fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said
Klesmer, suddenly dropping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) quick narrative to a reflective
tone, with an impressive frown, <div class="bookquote">``I am very sensible to wit and humor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you tell me that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, not without some
wickedness of intention. But Klesmer's thoughts had flown off on the
wings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) own statement, as their habit was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had the
wickedness all to herself. <div class="bookquote">``Pray, who is that standing near the
card-room door?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went on, seeing there the same stranger with whom
Klesmer had been in animated talk on the archery ground. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a
friend of yours, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; an amateur I have seen in town; Lush, a Mr. Lush--too fond of
Meyerbeer and Scribe--too fond of the mechanical-dramatic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks. I wanted to know whether you thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Scribe</b></font>) face and form
required that his (<font color='blue'><b>Scribe</b></font>) words should be among the meanings of noble music?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>Klesmer was conquered, and flashed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) a delightful smile which made
them quite friendly until she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) begged to be deposited by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mamma.

<p/>Three minutes afterward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) preparations for Grandcourt's indifference
were all canceled. Turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head after some remark to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) way up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask if you are tired of dancing, Miss Harleth?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) began,
looking down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) former unperturbed expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you do me the honor--the next--or another quadrille?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have been very happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) card,
<div class="bookquote">``but I am engaged for the next to Mr. Clintock--and indeed I perceive
that I am doomed for every quadrille; I have not one to dispose of.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not sorry to punish Mr. Grandcourt's tardiness, yet at the same
time she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have liked to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) a charming
smile as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked up to deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) stood still
looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with no smile at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am unfortunate in being too late,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, after a moment's pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seemed to me that you did not care for dancing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I
thought it might be one of the things you had left off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I have not begun to dance with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt. Always
there was the same pause before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cue. <div class="bookquote">``You make dancing a
new thing, as you make archery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is novelty always agreeable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no--not always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't know whether to feel flattered or not. When you had once
danced with me there would be no more novelty in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, there would probably be much more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is deep. I don't understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is difficult to make Miss Harleth understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) power?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>Here
Grandcourt had turned to Mrs. Davilow, who, smiling gently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
daughter, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) does not generally strike people as slow to understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a deprecating tone, <div class="bookquote">``I am adorably stupid,
and want everything explained to me--when the meaning is pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are stupid, I admit that stupidity is adorable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>returned
Grandcourt, after the usual pause, and without change of tone. But
clearly he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knew what to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to think that my cavalier has forgotten me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen
observed after a little while. <div class="bookquote">``I see the quadrille is being formed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) deserves to be renounced,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is very pardonable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There must have been some misunderstanding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Clintock was too anxious about the engagement to have forgotten it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div><p/>But now Lady Brackenshaw came up and said, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Harleth, Mr. Clintock
has charged me to express to you his (<font color='blue'><b>Clintock</b></font>) deep regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clintock</b></font>) was obliged to
leave without having the pleasure of dancing with you again. An express
came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clintock</b></font>) father, the archdeacon; something important; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clintock</b></font>) was to
go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clintock</b></font>) was _au désespoir_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clintock</b></font>) was very good to remember the engagement under the
circumstances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Clintock</b></font>) was called away.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was
easy to be politely sorrowful on so felicitous an occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I can profit by Mr. Clintock's misfortune?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt. <div class="bookquote">``May
I hope that you will let me take his (<font color='blue'><b>Clintock</b></font>) place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very happy to dance the next quadrille with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>The appropriateness of the event seemed an augury, and as Gwendolen
stood up for the quadrille with Grandcourt, there was a revival in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
of the exultation--the sense of carrying everything before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had felt earlier in the day. No man could have walked through the
quadrille with more irreproachable ease than Grandcourt; and the
absence of all eagerness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) partner's
taste. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was now convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) meant to distinguish her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), to mark
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in a noticeable way; and it began to appear
probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power to reject him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), whence
there was a pleasure in reckoning up the advantages which would make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rejection splendid, and in giving Mr. Grandcourt his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) utmost value.
It was also agreeable to divine that this exclusive selection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to
dance with, from among all the unmarried ladies present, would attract
observation; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) studiously avoided seeing this, and at the end
of the quadrille walked away on Grandcourt's arm as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been one
of the shortest sighted instead of the longest and widest sighted of
mortals. They encountered Miss Arrowpoint, who was standing with Lady
Brackenshaw and a group of gentlemen. The heiress looked at Gwendolen
invitingly and said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you will vote with us, Miss Harleth, and
Mr. Grandcourt too, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is not an archer.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen and
Grandcourt paused to join the group, and found that the voting turned
on the project of a picnic archery meeting to be held in Cardell Chase,
where the evening entertainment would be more poetic than a ball under
chandeliers--a feast of sunset lights along the glades and through the
branches and over the solemn tree-tops.

<p/>Gwendolen thought the scheme delightful--equal to playing Robin Hood
and Maid Marian: and Mr. Grandcourt, when appealed to a second time,
said it was a thing to be done; whereupon Mr. Lush, who stood behind
Lady Brackenshaw's elbow, drew Gwendolen's notice by saying with a
familiar look and tone to Grandcourt, <div class="bookquote">``Diplow would be a good place for
the meeting, and more convenient: there's a fine bit between the oaks
toward the north gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Impossible to look more unconscious of being addressed than Grandcourt;
but Gwendolen took a new survey of the speaker, deciding, first, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) must be on terms of intimacy with the tenant of Diplow, and,
secondly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would never, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could help it, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) come
within a yard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was subject to physical antipathies, and Mr.
Lush's prominent eyes, fat though not clumsy figure, and strong black
gray-besprinkled hair of frizzy thickness, which, with the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>)
prosperous person, was enviable to many, created one of the strongest
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) antipathies. To be safe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) murmured to
Grandcourt, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to continue walking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) obeyed immediately; but when they were thus away from any audience,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) spoke no word for several minutes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), out of a half-amused,
half-serious inclination for experiment, would not speak first. They
turned into the large conservatory, beautifully lit up with Chinese
lamps. The other couples there were at a distance which would not have
interfered with any dialogue, but still they walked in silence until
they had reached the farther end where there was a flush of pink light,
and the second wide opening into the ball-room. Grandcourt, when they
had half turned round, paused and said languidly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like this kind of thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>If the situation had been described to Gwendolen half an hour before,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have laughed heartily at it, and could only have imagined
herself returning a playful, satirical answer. But for some mysterious
reason--it was a mystery of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a faint wondering
consciousness--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dared not be satirical: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had begun to feel a wand
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) afraid of offending Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, quietly, without considering what <div class="bookquote">``kind of thing''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was
meant--whether the flowers, the scents, the ball in general, or this
episode of walking with Mr. Grandcourt in particular. And they returned
along the conservatory without farther interpretation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) then
proposed to go and sit down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) old place, and they walked among
scattered couples preparing for the waltz to the spot where Mrs.
Davilow had been seated all the evening. As they approached it her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) seat
was vacant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) was coming toward it again, and, to Gwendolen's
shuddering annoyance, with Mr. Lush at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) elbow. There was no avoiding
the confrontation: her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma came close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) before they had reached
the seats, and, after a quiet greeting smile, said innocently,
<div class="bookquote">``Gwendolen, dear, let me present Mr. Lush to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Having just made the
acquaintance of this personage, as an intimate and constant companion
of Mr. Grandcourt's, Mrs. Davilow imagined it altogether desirable that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) daughter also should make the acquaintance.

<p/>It was hardly a bow that Gwendolen gave--rather, it was the slightest
forward sweep of the head away from the physiognomy that inclined
itself toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) immediately moved toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seat, saying,
<div class="bookquote">``I want to put on my burnous.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>No sooner had she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) reached it, than Mr.
Lush was there, and had the burnous in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) hand: to annoy this
supercilious young lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) would incur the offense of forestalling
Grandcourt; and, holding up the garment close to Gwendolen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Pray, permit me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), wheeling away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) had been a
muddy hound, glided on to the ottoman, saying, <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A man who forgave this would have much Christian feeling, supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had intended to be agreeable to the young lady; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seized
the burnous Mr. Lush had ceased to have that intention. Grandcourt
quietly took the drapery from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and Mr. Lush, with a slight bow,
moved away. <div class="bookquote">``You had perhaps better put it on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grandcourt,
looking down on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) without change of expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks; perhaps it would be wise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, rising, and
submitting very gracefully to take the burnous on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/>After that, Mr. Grandcourt exchanged a few polite speeches with Mrs.
Davilow, and, in taking leave, asked permission to call at Offendene
the next day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was evidently not offended by the insult directed
toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) friend. Certainly Gwendolen's refusal of the burnous from
Mr. Lush was open to the interpretation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wished to receive it
from Mr. Grandcourt. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), poor child, had no design in this action,
and was simply following her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) antipathy and inclination, confiding in
them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did in the more reflective judgments into which they
entered as sap into leafage. Gwendolen had no sense that these men were
dark enigmas to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) needed any help in drawing conclusions
about them--Mr. Grandcourt at least. The chief question was, how far
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) character and ways might answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wishes; and unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were
satisfied about that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had said to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would not accept
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) offer.

<p/>Could there be a slenderer, more insignificant thread in human history
than this consciousness of a girl, busy with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) small inferences of
the way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life pleasant?--in a time, too,
when ideas were with fresh vigor making armies of themselves, and the
universal kinship was declaring itself fiercely; when women on the
other side of the world would not mourn for the husbands and sons who
died bravely in a common cause, and men stinted of bread on our side of
the world heard of that willing loss and were patient: a time when the
soul of man was walking to pulses which had for centuries been beating
in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unfelt, until their full sum made a new life of terror or of joy.

<p/>What in the midst of that mighty drama are girls and their blind
visions? They are the Yea or Nay of that good for which men are
enduring and fighting. In these delicate vessels is borne onward
through the ages the treasure of human affections.




<p/>CHAPTER XII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O gentlemen, the time of life is short;
To spend that shortness basely were too long,
If life did ride upon a dial's point,
Still ending at the arrival of an hour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--SHAKESPEARE: _Henry IV_.


<p/>On the second day after the Archery Meeting, Mr. Henleigh Mallinger
Grandcourt was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) breakfast-table with Mr. Lush. Everything around
them was agreeable: the summer air through the open windows, at which
the dogs could walk in from the old green turf on the lawn; the soft,
purplish coloring of the park beyond, stretching toward a mass of
bordering wood; the still life in the room, which seemed the stiller
for its sober antiquated elegance, as if it kept a conscious, well-bred
silence, unlike the restlessness of vulgar furniture.

<p/>Whether the gentlemen were agreeable to each other was less evident.
Mr. Grandcourt had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) chair aside so as to face the lawn, and
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) left leg over another chair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) right elbow on the table,
was smoking a large cigar, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) companion was still eating. The
dogs--half-a-dozen of various kinds were moving lazily in and out,
taking attitudes of brief attention--gave a vacillating preference
first to one gentleman, then to the other; being dogs in such good
circumstances that they could play at hunger, and liked to be served
with delicacies which they declined to put in their mouths; all except
Fetch, the beautiful liver-colored water-spaniel, which sat with its
forepaws firmly planted and its expressive brown face turned upward,
watching Grandcourt with unshaken constancy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lap a tiny
Maltese dog with a tiny silver collar and bell, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had a hand
unused by cigar or coffee-cup, it rested on this small parcel of animal
warmth. I fear that Fetch was jealous, and wounded that her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) master gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) no word or look; at last it seemed that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) could bear this neglect
no longer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) gently put her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) large silky paw on her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) master's leg.
Grandcourt looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) with unchanged face for half a minute, and
then took the trouble to lay down his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cigar while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lifted the
unimpassioned Fluff close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) chin and gave it caressing pats, all
the while gravely watching Fetch, who, poor thing, whimpered
interruptedly, as if trying to repress that sign of discontent, and at
last rested her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) head beside the appealing paw, looking up with piteous
beseeching. So, at least, a lover of dogs must have interpreted Fetch,
and Grandcourt kept so many dogs that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was reputed to love them; at
any rate, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) impulse to act just in that way started from such an
interpretation. But when the amusing anguish burst forth in a howling
bark, Grandcourt pushed Fetch down without speaking, and, depositing
Fluff carelessly on the table -LRB-where his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) black nose predominated over a
salt-cellar-RRB-, began to look to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cigar, and found, with some
annoyance against Fetch as the cause, that the brute of a cigar
required relighting. Fetch, having begun to wail, found, like others of
her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) sex, that it was not easy to leave off; indeed, the second howl was
a louder one, and the third was like unto it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn out that brute, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt to Lush, without
raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) voice or looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) counted on attention to
the smallest sign.

<p/>And Lush immediately rose, lifted Fetch, though she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was rather heavy,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was not fond of stooping, and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) out, disposing of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
in some way that took him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) a couple of minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) returned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
then lit a cigar, placed himself at an angle where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could see
Grandcourt's face without turning, and presently said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you ride or drive to Quetcham to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to Quetcham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not go yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt smoked in silence for half a minute, and then said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you sent my card and inquiries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I went myself at four, and said you were sure to be there shortly.
They would suppose some accident prevented you from fulfilling the
intention. Especially if you go to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a couple</b></font>)</div><p/>Silence for a couple of minutes. Then Grandcourt said, <div class="bookquote">``What men are
invited here with their wives?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Lush drew out a note-book. <div class="bookquote">``The Captain and Mrs. Torrington come next
week. Then there are Mr. Hollis and Lady Flora, and the Cushats and the
Gogoffs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather a ragged lot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>remarked Grandcourt, after a while. <div class="bookquote">``Why did you
ask the Gogoffs? When you write invitations in my name, be good enough
to give me a list, instead of bringing down a giantess on me without my
knowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) spoils the look of the room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You invited the Gogoffs yourself when you met them in Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has my meeting them in Paris to do with it? I told you to give me
a list.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt, like many others, had two remarkably different voices.
Hitherto we have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) speaking in a superficial interrupted drawl
suggestive chiefly of languor and _ennui_. But this last brief speech
was uttered in subdued inward, yet distinct, tones, which Lush had long
been used to recognize as the expression of a peremptory will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are there any other couples you would like to invite?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; think of some decent people, with a daughter or two. And one of
your damned musicians. But not a comic fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if Klesmer would consent to come to us when he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) leaves
Quetcham. Nothing but first-class music will go down with Miss
Arrowpoint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lush spoke carelessly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was really seizing an opportunity and
fixing an observant look on Grandcourt, who now for the first time,
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) eyes toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) companion, but slowly and without speaking
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had given two long luxuriant puffs, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, perhaps in a
lower tone than ever, but with a perceptible edge of contempt--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What in the name of nonsense have I to do with Miss Arrowpoint and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
music?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, something,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Lush, jocosely. <div class="bookquote">``You need not give yourself
much trouble, perhaps. But some forms must be gone through before a man
can marry a million.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely. But I am not going to marry a million.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a pity--to fling away an opportunity of this sort, and knock
down your own plans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Your_ plans, I suppose you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have some debts, you know, and things may turn out inconveniently
after all. The heirship is not _absolutely_ certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt did not answer, and Lush went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It really is a fine opportunity. The father and mother ask for nothing
better, I can see, and the daughter's looks and manners require no
allowances, any more than if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hadn't a sixpence. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is not
beautiful; but equal to carrying any rank. And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is not likely to
refuse such prospects as you can offer her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The father and mother would let you do anything you like with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I should not like to do anything with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Here it was Lush who made a little pause before speaking again, and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said in a deep voice of remonstrance, <div class="bookquote">``Good God, Grandcourt!
after your experience, will you let a whim interfere with your
comfortable settlement in life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Spare your oratory. I know what I am going to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lush put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cigar and thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) side
pockets, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had to face something exasperating, but meant to keep
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) temper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to marry the other girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you fallen in love?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This question carried a strong sneer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) an offer already, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is a young lady with a will of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own, I fancy. Extremely well
fitted to make a rumpus. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would know what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) liked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doesn't like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, with the ghost of a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly true,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Lush, adding again in a markedly sneering tone.
<div class="bookquote">``However, if you and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) are devoted to each other, that will be
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt took no notice of this speech, but sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) coffee, rose,
and strolled out on the lawn, all the dogs following him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/>Lush glanced after him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) a moment, then resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cigar and lit it, but
smoked slowly, consulting his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) beard with inspecting eyes and fingers,
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) finally stroked it with an air of having arrived at some
conclusion, and said in a subdued voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Check, old boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lush, being a man of some ability, had not known Grandcourt for fifteen
years without learning what sort of measures were useless with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>),
though what sort might be useful remained often dubious. In the
beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) career he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) held a fellowship, and was near taking
orders for the sake of a college living, but not being fond of that
prospect accepted instead the office of traveling companion to a
marquess, and afterward to young Grandcourt, who had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) father
early, and who found Lush so convenient that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to
become prime minister in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) more personal affairs. The habit of
fifteen years had made Grandcourt more and more in need of Lush's
handiness, and Lush more and more in need of the lazy luxury to which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) transactions on behalf of Grandcourt made no interruption worth
reckoning. I cannot say that the same lengthened habit had intensified
Grandcourt's want of respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) companion since that want had been
absolute from the beginning, but it had confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
might kick Lush if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) chose--only he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) never did choose to kick any
animal, because the act of kicking is a compromising attitude, and a
gentleman's dogs should be kicked for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) only said things which
might have exposed himself to be kicked if his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) confidant had been a man
of independent spirit. But what son of a vicar who has stinted his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) wife
and daughters of calico in order to send his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) male offspring to Oxford,
can keep an independent spirit when he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) is bent on dining with high
discrimination, riding good horses, living generally in the most
luxuriant honey-blossomed clover--and all without working? Mr. Lush had
passed for a scholar once, and had still a sense of scholarship when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>)
was not trying to remember much of it; but the bachelor's and other
arts which soften manners are a time-honored preparation for sinecures;
and Lush's present comfortable provision was as good a sinecure in not
requiring more than the odor of departed learning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) was not
unconscious of being held kickable, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) preferred counting that
estimate among the peculiarities of Grandcourt's character, which made
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) incalculable moods or judgments as good as another. Since in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own opinion he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had never done a bad action, it did not seem
necessary to consider whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should be likely to commit one if his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
love of ease required it. Lush's love of ease was well-satisfied at
present, and if his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) puddings were rolled toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) in the dust, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
took the inside bits and found them relishing.

<p/>This morning, for example, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had encountered more annoyance
than usual, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) private sitting-room and played a good hour
on the violoncello.




<p/>CHAPTER XIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Philistia, be thou glad of me!''


 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mind to marry Miss Harleth, showed a
power of adapting means to ends. During the next fortnight there was
hardly a day on which by some arrangement or other he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>),
or prove by emphatic attentions that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thoughts. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
cousin, Mrs. Torrington, was now doing the honors of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) house, so that
Mrs. Davilow and Gwendolen could be invited to a large party at Diplow
in which there were many witnesses how the host distinguished the
dowerless beauty, and showed no solicitude about the heiress. The
world--I mean Mr. Gascoigne and all the families worth speaking of
within visiting distance of Pennicote--felt an assurance on the subject
which in the rector's mind converted itself into a resolution to do his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>)
duty by his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) niece and see that the settlements were adequate. Indeed
the wonder to him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) and Mrs. Davilow was that the offer for which so many
suitable occasions presented themselves had not been already made; and
in this wonder Grandcourt himself was not without a share. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had
told his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) resolution to Lush he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had thought that the affair would be
concluded more quickly, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had repeatedly
promised himself in a morning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would to-day give Gwendolen the
opportunity of accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and had found in the evening that the
necessary formality was still unaccomplished. This remarkable fact
served to heighten his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) determination on another day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had never
admitted to himself that Gwendolen might refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), but--heaven help
us all!--we are often unable to act on our certainties; our objection
to a contrary issue -LRB-were it possible-RRB- is so strong that it rises like
a spectral illusion between us and our certainty; we are rationally
sure that the blind worm can not bite us mortally, but it would be so
intolerable to be bitten, and the creature has a biting look--we
decline to handle it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had asked leave to have a beautiful horse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) brought for
Gwendolen to ride. Mrs. Davilow was to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) in the carriage,
and they were to go to Diplow to lunch, Grandcourt conducting them. It
was a fine mid-harvest time, not too warm for a noonday ride of five
miles to be delightful; the poppies glowed on the borders of the
fields, there was enough breeze to move gently like a social spirit
among the ears of uncut corn, and to wing the shadow of a cloud across
the soft gray downs; here the sheaves were standing, there the horses
were straining their muscles under the last load from a wide space of
stubble, but everywhere the green pasture made a broader setting for
the corn-fields, and the cattle took their rest under wide branches.
The road lay through a bit of country where the dairy-farms looked much
as they did in the days of our forefathers--where peace and permanence
seemed to find a home away from the busy change that sent the railway
train flying in the distance.

<p/>But the spirit of peace and permanence did not penetrate poor Mrs.
Davilow's mind so as to overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) habit of uneasy foreboding.
Gwendolen and Grandcourt cantering in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and then slackening
their pace to a conversational walk till the carriage came up with them
again, made a gratifying sight; but it served chiefly to keep up the
conflict of hopes and fears about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) daughter's lot. Here was an
irresistible opportunity for a lover to speak and put an end to all
uncertainties, and Mrs. Davilow could only hope with trembling that
Gwendolen's decision would be favorable. Certainly if Rex's love had
been repugnant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), Mr. Grandcourt had the advantage of being in
complete contrast with Rex; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had produced some quite novel
impression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seemed evident in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) marked abstinence from
satirical observations, nay, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) total silence about his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
characteristics, a silence which Mrs. Davilow did not dare to break.
<div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a man she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would be happy with?'' (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>--was a question that inevitably
arose in the mother's mind. <div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps as happy as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would be
with any one else--or as most other women are'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--was the answer with
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) tried to quiet herself; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) could not imagine Gwendolen
under the influence of any feeling which would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) satisfied in
what we traditionally call <div class="bookquote">``mean circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt's own thought was looking in the same direction: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wanted
to have done with the uncertainty that belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) not having
spoken. As to any further uncertainty--well, it was something without
any reasonable basis, some quality in the air which acted as an
irritant to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wishes.

<p/>Gwendolen enjoyed the riding, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pleasure did not break forth in
girlish unpremeditated chat and laughter as it did on that morning with
Rex. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoke a little, and even laughed, but with a lightness as of a
far-off echo: for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) too there was some peculiar quality in the
air--not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was sure, any subjugation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) will by Mr. Grandcourt,
and the splendid prospects he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) meant to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); for Gwendolen desired
every one, that dignified gentleman himself included, to understand
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was going to do just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) liked, and that they had better
not calculate on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pleasing them. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chose to take this husband,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not going to renounce her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) freedom,
or according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) favorite formula, <div class="bookquote">``not going to do as other women
did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt's speeches this morning were, as usual, all of that brief
sort which never fails to make a conversational figure when the speaker
is held important in his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) circle. Stopping so soon, they give signs of a
suppressed and formidable ability so say more, and have also the
meritorious quality of allowing lengthiness to others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you like Criterion's paces?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) said, after they had entered
the park and were slacking from a canter to a walk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is delightful to ride. I should like to have a leap with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), if it
would not frighten mamma. There was a good wide channel we passed five
minutes ago. I should like to have a gallop back and take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray do. We can take it together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thanks. Mamma is so timid--if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw me it might make her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go and explain. Criterion would take it without fail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--indeed--you are very kind--but it would alarm her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) too much. I dare
take any leap when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is not by; but I do it and don't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) about
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can let the carriage pass and then set off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, pray don't think of it any more: I spoke quite randomly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began to feel a new objection to carrying out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own
proposition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mrs. Davilow knows I shall take care of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) would think of you as having to take care of my broken
neck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a considerable pause before Grandcourt said, looking toward
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I should like to have the right always to take care of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen did not turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>); it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) a long while
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was first blushing, and then turning pale, but to Grandcourt's
rate of judgment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) answered soon enough, with the lightest flute-tone
and a careless movement of the head, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am not sure that I want to
be taken care of: if I chose to risk breaking my neck, I should like to
be at liberty to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) horse as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoke, and turned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saddle, looking
toward the advancing carriage. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes swept across Grandcourt as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
made this movement, but there was no language in them to correct the
carelessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) reply. At that very moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was risking something--not her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck, but the possibility of finally
checking Grandcourt's advances, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not feel contented with the
possibility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>thought Grandcourt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) too checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was not
a wordy thinker, and this explosive phrase stood for mixed impressions
which eloquent interpreters might have expanded into some sentences
full of an irritated sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was being mystified, and a
determination that this girl should not make a fool of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). Did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
want him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to throw himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet and declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was dying for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? It was not by that gate that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could enter on the privileges he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
could give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Or did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) expect him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to write his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) proposals? Equally a
delusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) would not make his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) offer in any way that could place him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
definitely in the position of being rejected. But as to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) accepting
him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had done it already in accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) marked attentions: and
anything which happened to break them off would be understood to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
disadvantage. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was merely coquetting, then?

<p/>However, the carriage came up, and no further _tete-à-tete_ could well
occur before their arrival at the house, where there was abundant
company, to whom Gwendolen, clad in riding-dress, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hat laid
aside, clad also in the repute of being chosen by Mr. Grandcourt, was
naturally a centre of observation; and since the objectionable Mr. Lush
was not there to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), this stimulus of admiring attention
heightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spirits, and dispersed, for the time, the uneasy
consciousness of divided impulses which threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with repentance
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own acts. Whether Grandcourt had been offended or not there was
no judging: his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) manners were unchanged, but Gwendolen's acuteness had
not gone deeper than to discern that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) manners were no clue for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
and because these were unchanged she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not the less afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not been at Diplow before except to dine; and since certain
points of view from the windows and the garden were worth showing, Lady
Flora Hollis proposed after luncheon, when some of the guests had
dispersed, and the sun was sloping toward four o'clock, that the
remaining party should make a little exploration. Here came frequent
opportunities when Grandcourt might have retained Gwendolen apart, and
have spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) unheard. But no! He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) indeed spoke to no one else, but
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said was nothing more eager or intimate than it had been in
their first interview. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) not less than usual; and some
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) defiant spirit having come back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked full at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) in
return, not caring--rather preferring--that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) eyes had no expression
in them.

<p/>But at last it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) entertained some contrivance. After they
had nearly made the tour of the grounds, the whole party stopped by the
pool to be amused with Fetch's accomplishment of bringing a water lily
to the bank like Cowper's spaniel Beau, and having been disappointed in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Beau</b></font>) first attempt insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Beau</b></font>) trying again.

<p/>Here Grandcourt, who stood with Gwendolen outside the group, turned
deliberately, and fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) eyes on a knoll planted with American
shrubs, and having a winding path up it, said languidly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a bore. Shall we go up there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly--since we are exploring,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was rather
pleased, and yet afraid.

<p/>The path was too narrow for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) arm, and they walked up in
silence. When they were on the bit of platform at the summit,
Grandcourt said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing to be seen here: the thing was not worth climbing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>How was it that Gwendolen did not laugh? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was perfectly silent,
holding up the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) robe like a statue, and giving a harder
grasp to the handle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) whip, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had snatched up
automatically with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hat when they had first set off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of a place do you prefer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Different places are agreeable in their way. On the whole, I think, I
prefer places that are open and cheerful. I am not fond of anything
sombre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your place of Offendene is too sombre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, rather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not remain there long, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I think so. Mamma likes to be near her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Silence for a short space.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not to be supposed that _you_ will always live there, though
Mrs. Davilow may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. We women can't go in search of adventures--to find out
the North-West Passage or the source of the Nile, or to hunt tigers in
the East. We must stay where we grow, or where the gardeners like to
transplant us. We are brought up like the flowers, to look as pretty as
we can, and be dull without complaining. That is my notion about the
plants; they are often bored, and that is the reason why some of them
have got poisonous. What do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen had run on rather
nervously, lightly whipping the rhododendron bush in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite agree. Most things are bores,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mind
having been pushed into an easy current, away from its intended track.
But, after a moment's pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) continued in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) broken, refined drawl--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But a woman can be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some women can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, certainly, unless you are obstinately cruel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I am not both cruel and obstinate.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Here Gwendolen
suddenly turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head and looked full at Grandcourt, whose eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had felt to be upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) throughout their conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
wondering what the effect of looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would be on herself rather
than on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) stood perfectly still, half a yard or more away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and it
flashed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind what a sort of lotus-eater's stupor had begun
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) and was taking possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you as uncertain about yourself as you make others about you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite uncertain about myself; I don't know how uncertain others
may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you wish them to understand that you don't care?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt,
with a touch of new hardness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen replied, hesitatingly, and turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
eyes away whipped the rhododendron bush again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were on
horseback that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might set off on a canter. It was impossible to set
off running down the knoll.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do care, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, not more quickly, but with a
softened drawl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! my whip!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a little scream of distress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
let it go--what could be more natural in a slight agitation?--and--but
this seemed less natural in a gold-handled whip which had been left
altogether to itself--it had gone with some force over the immediate
shrubs, and had lodged itself in the branches of an azalea half-way
down the knoll. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could run down now, laughing prettily, and
Grandcourt was obliged to follow; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was beforehand with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) in
rescuing the whip, and continued on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) way to the level ground, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) paused and looked at Grandcourt with an exasperating brightness in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) glance and a heightened color, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had carried a triumph, and
these indications were still noticeable to Mrs. Davilow when Gwendolen
and Grandcourt joined the rest of the party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all coquetting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>thought Grandcourt; <div class="bookquote">``the next time I beckon she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
will come down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) likely that this final beckoning might happen the very
next day, when there was to be a picnic archery meeting in Cardell
Chase, according to the plan projected on the evening of the ball.

<p/>Even in Gwendolen's mind that result was one of two likelihoods that
presented themselves alternately, one of two decisions toward which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was being precipitated, as if they were two sides of a boundary-line,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not know on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should fall. This subjection to a
possible self, a self not to be absolutely predicted about, caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
some astonishment and terror; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) favorite key of life--doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
liked--seemed to fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not foresee what at a given
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might like to do. The prospect of marrying Grandcourt really
seemed more attractive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had believed beforehand that any
marriage could be: the dignities, the luxuries, the power of doing a
great deal of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) liked to do, which had now come close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
and within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) choice to secure or to lose, took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nature as
if it had been the strong odor of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had only imagined and longed
for before. And Grandcourt himself? He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) seemed as little of a flaw in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) fortunes as a lover and husband could possibly be. Gwendolen wished
to mount the chariot and drive the plunging horses herself, with a
spouse by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) side who would fold his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) arms and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) countenance
without looking ridiculous. Certainly, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) perspicacity, and
all the reading which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma dangerously instructive, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
judgment was consciously a little at fault before Grandcourt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was
adorably quiet and free from absurdities--he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would be a husband to suit
with the best appearance a woman could make. But what else was he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
had been everywhere, and seen everything. _That_ was desirable, and
especially gratifying as a preamble to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) supreme preference for
Gwendolen Harleth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not appear to enjoy anything much. That was
not necessary: and the less he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had of particular tastes, or desires,
the more freedom his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wife was likely to have in following hers.
Gwendolen conceived that after marriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would most probably be able
to manage him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thoroughly.

<p/>How was it that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) unusual constraint now?--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
less daring and playful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) than with any other
admirer she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had known? That absence of demonstrativeness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
glad of, acted as a charm in more senses than one, and was slightly
benumbing. Grandcourt after all was formidable--a handsome lizard of a
hitherto unknown species, not of the lively, darting kind. But
Gwendolen knew hardly anything about lizards, and ignorance gives one a
large range of probabilities. This splendid specimen was probably
gentle, suitable as a boudoir pet: what may not a lizard be, if you
know nothing to the contrary? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) acquaintance with Grandcourt was such
that no accomplishment suddenly revealed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would have surprised
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was so little suggestive of drama, that it hardly occurred
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to think with any detail how his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) life of thirty-six years had
been passed: in general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) always cold and dignified,
not likely ever to have committed himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had hunted the tiger--had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) ever been in love or made love? The one experience and the other
seemed alike remote in Gwendolen's fancy from the Mr. Grandcourt who
had come to Diplow in order apparently to make a chief epoch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
destiny--perhaps by introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to that state of marriage which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had resolved to make a state of greater freedom than her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) girlhood. And
on the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wished to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) purpose; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
prevailing, deliberate intention was, to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/>But was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) going to fulfill her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) deliberate intention? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began to be
afraid of herself, and to find out a certain difficulty in doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
liked. Already her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) assertion of independence in evading his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) advances
had been carried farther than was necessary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was thinking with
some anxiety what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might do on the next occasion.

<p/>Seated according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) habit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) back to the horses on their
drive homeward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was completely under the observation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma,
who took the excitement and changefulness in the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) unwonted absence of mind and total silence, as unmistakable
signs that something unprecedented had occurred between her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and
Grandcourt. Mrs. Davilow's uneasiness determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) to risk some
speech on the subject: the Gascoignes were to dine at Offendene, and in
what had occurred this morning there might be some reason for
consulting the rector; not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) expected him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) anymore than herself
to influence Gwendolen, but that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) anxious mind wanted to be
disburdened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something has happened, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began, in a tender tone of question.

<p/>Gwendolen looked round, and seeming to be roused to the consciousness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) physical self, took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gloves and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hat, that the
soft breeze might blow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head. They were in a retired bit of the
road, where the long afternoon shadows from the bordering trees fell
across it and no observers were within sight. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes continued to
meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grandcourt has been saying something?--Tell me, dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The last
words were uttered beseechingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to tell you, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the perverse answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure something has agitated you. You ought to confide in me,
Gwen. You ought not to leave me in doubt and anxiety.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Davilow's
eyes filled with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, dear, please don't be miserable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with pettish
remonstrance. <div class="bookquote">``It only makes me more so. I am in doubt myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Mr. Grandcourt's intentions?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, gathering
determination from her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) alarms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with some curtness, and a pretty
little toss of the head as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hat again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About whether you will accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you given him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) a doubtful answer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) no answer at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) _has_ spoken so that you could not misunderstand him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as I would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to persevere?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Davilow put this question rather
anxiously, and receiving no answer, asked another: <div class="bookquote">``You don't consider
that you have discouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I do, mamma, as liking goes. There is less to dislike about him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
than about most men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is quiet and _distingué_.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen so far
spoke with a pouting sort of gravity; but suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) recovered some
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mischievousness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face broke into a smile as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
added--<div class="bookquote">``Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) has all the qualities that would make a husband
tolerable--battlement, veranda, stable, etc., no grins and no glass in
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do be serious with me for a moment, dear. Am I to understand that you
mean to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, pray, mamma, leave me to myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a pettish
distress in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) voice.

<p/>And Mrs. Davilow said no more.

<p/>When they got home Gwendolen declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would not dine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
tired, and would come down in the evening after she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had taken some
rest. The probability that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle would hear what had passed did not
trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was convinced that whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) might say would be on
the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) accepting Grandcourt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wished to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could. At this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would willingly have had weights hung on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own caprice.

<p/>Mr. Gascoigne did hear--not Gwendolen's answers repeated verbatim, but
a softened generalized account of them. The mother conveyed as vaguely
as the keen rector's questions would let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the impression that
Gwendolen was in some uncertainty about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own mind, but inclined on
the whole to acceptance. The result was that the uncle felt himself
called on to interfere; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) did not conceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) should do his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) duty
in witholding direction from his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) niece in a momentous crisis of this
kind. Mrs. Davilow ventured a hesitating opinion that perhaps it would
be safer to say nothing--Gwendolen was so sensitive -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not like
to say willful-RRB-. But the rector's was a firm mind, grasping its first
judgments tenaciously and acting on them promptly, whence
counter-judgments were no more for him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) than shadows fleeting across the
solid ground to which he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) adjusted himself.

<p/>This match with Grandcourt presented itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) as a sort of public
affair; perhaps there were ways in which it might even strengthen the
establishment. To the rector, whose father -LRB-nobody would have suspected
it, and nobody was told-RRB- had risen to be a provincial corn-dealer,
aristocratic heirship resembled regal heirship in excepting its
possessor from the ordinary standard of moral judgments, Grandcourt,
the almost certain baronet, the probable peer, was to be ranged with
public personages, and was a match to be accepted on broad general
grounds national and ecclesiastical. Such public personages, it is
true, are often in the nature of giants which an ancient community may
have felt pride and safety in possessing, though, regarded privately,
these born eminences must often have been inconvenient and even
noisome. But of the future husband personally Mr. Gascoigne was
disposed to think the best. Gossip is a sort of smoke that comes from
the dirty tobacco-pipes of those who diffuse it: it proves nothing
but the bad taste of the smoker. But if Grandcourt had really made any
deeper or more unfortunate experiments in folly than were common in
young men of high prospects, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was of an age to have finished them.
All accounts can be suitably wound up when a man has not ruined
himself, and the expense may be taken as an insurance against future
error. This was the view of practical wisdom; with reference to higher
views, repentance had a supreme moral and religious value. There was
every reason to believe that a woman of well-regulated mind would be
happy with Grandcourt.

<p/>It was no surprise to Gwendolen on coming down to tea to be told that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in the dining-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) threw aside the
paper as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) entered and greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) usual kindness. As his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
wife had remarked, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) always <div class="bookquote">``made much''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of Gwendolen, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
importance had risen of late. <div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said, in a fatherly way,
moving a chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to you on
a subject which is more momentous than any other with regard to your
welfare. You will guess what I mean. But I shall speak to you with
perfect directness: in such matters I consider myself bound to act as
your father. You have no objection, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, no, uncle. You have always been very kind to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, frankly. This evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was willing, if it were possible,
to be a little fortified against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) troublesome self, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
resistant temper was in abeyance. The rector's mode of speech always
conveyed a thrill of authority, as of a word of command: it seemed to
take for granted that there could be no wavering in the audience, and
that every one was going to be rationally obedient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is naturally a satisfaction to me that the prospect of a marriage
for you--advantageous in the highest degree--has presented itself so
early. I do not know exactly what has passed between you and Mr.
Grandcourt, but I presume there can be little doubt, from the way in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) has distinguished you, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) desires to make you his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen did not speak immediately, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle said with more
emphasis--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any doubt of that yourself, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose that is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) has been thinking of. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) may have
changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mind to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why to-morrow? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) made advances which you have discouraged?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) meant--he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) began to make advances--but I did not encourage
them. I turned the conversation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you confide in me so far as to tell me your reasons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I had any reasons, uncle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen laughed rather
artificially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite capable of reflecting, Gwendolen. You are aware that
this is not a trivial occasion, and it concerns your establishment for
life under circumstances which may not occur again. You have a duty
here both to yourself and your family. I wish to understand whether you
have any ground for hesitating as to your acceptance of Mr. Grandcourt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I hesitate without grounds.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen spoke rather
poutingly, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle grew suspicious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) disagreeable to you personally?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard anything of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) which has affected you disagreeably?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The rector</b></font>)</div>The rector thought it impossible that Gwendolen could have heard the
gossip he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) had heard, but in any case he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) must endeavor to put all things
in the right light for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is a great match,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, with some sauciness; <div class="bookquote">``and that affects me very agreeably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, my dear Gwendolen, I have nothing further to say than this: you
hold your fortune in your own hands--a fortune such as rarely happens
to a girl in your circumstances--a fortune in fact which almost takes
the question out of the range of mere personal feeling, and makes your
acceptance of it a duty. If Providence offers you power and
position--especially when unclogged by any conditions that are
repugnant to you--your course is one of responsibility, into which
caprice must not enter. A man does not like to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attachment
trifled with: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may not be at once repelled--these things are matters
of individual disposition. But the trifling may be carried too far. And
I must point out to you that in case Mr. Grandcourt were repelled
without your having refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)--without your having intended
ultimately to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), your situation would be a humiliating and
painful one. I, for my part, should regard you with severe
disapprobation, as the victim of nothing else than your own coquetry
and folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen became pallid as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) listened to this admonitory speech. The
ideas it raised had the force of sensations. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resistant courage
would not help her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) here, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle was not urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own resolve; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was pressing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) the motives of dread which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) already felt; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was making her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) more conscious of the risks that
lay within herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was silent, and the rector observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) had
produced some strong effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean this in kindness, my dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) tone had softened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am aware of that, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, rising and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
head back, as if to rouse herself out of painful passivity. <div class="bookquote">``I am not
foolish. I know that I must be married some time--before it is too
late. And I don't see how I could do better than marry Mr. Grandcourt.
I mean to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), if possible.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were reinforcing
herself by speaking with this decisiveness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle.

<p/>But the rector was a little startled by so bare a version of his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) own
meaning from those young lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) wished that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) advice
should be taken in an infusion of sentiments proper to a girl, and such
as are presupposed in the advice of a clergyman, although he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) may not
consider them always appropriate to be put forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) wished his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) niece
parks, carriages, a title--everything that would make this world a
pleasant abode; but he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) not to be cynical--to be, on the
contrary, religiously dutiful, and have warm domestic affections.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Gwendolen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) said, rising also, and speaking with benignant
gravity, <div class="bookquote">``I trust that you will find in marriage a new fountain of duty
and affection. Marriage is the only true and satisfactory sphere of a
woman, and if your marriage with Mr. Grandcourt should be happily
decided upon, you will have, probably, an increasing power, both of
rank and wealth, which may be used for the benefit of others. These
considerations are something higher than romance! You are fitted by
natural gifts for a position which, considering your birth and early
prospects, could hardly be looked forward to as in the ordinary course
of things; and I trust that you will grace it, not only by those
personal gifts, but by a good and consistent life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope mamma will be the happier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a more cheerful
way, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands backward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck and moving toward the door.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wanted to waive those higher considerations.

<p/>Mr. Gascoigne felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) had come to a satisfactory understanding
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) niece, and had furthered her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) happy settlement in life by
furthering her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) engagement to Grandcourt. Meanwhile there was another
person to whom the contemplation of that issue had been a motive for
some activity, and who believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), too, on this particular day
had done something toward bringing about a favorable decision in _his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)_
sense--which happened to be the reverse of the rector's.

<p/>Mr. Lush's absence from Diplow during Gwendolen's visit had been due,
not to any fear on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) part of meeting that supercilious young lady, or
of being abashed by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) frank dislike, but to an engagement from which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) expected important consequences. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) was gone, in fact, to the
Wanchester station to meet a lady, accompanied by a maid and two
children, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) put into a fly, and afterward followed to the hotel
of the Golden Keys, in that town. An impressive woman, whom many would
turn to look at again in passing; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) figure was slim and sufficiently
tall, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face rather emaciated, so that its sculpturesque beauty was
the more pronounced, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crisp hair perfectly black, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) large,
anxious eyes what we call black. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress was soberly correct, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
age, perhaps, physically more advanced than the number of years would
imply, but hardly less than seven-and-thirty. An uneasy-looking woman:
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glance seemed to presuppose that the people and things were going
to be unfavorable to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was, nevertheless, ready to meet
them with resolution. The children were lovely--a dark-haired girl of
six or more, a fairer boy of five. When Lush incautiously expressed
some surprise at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) having brought the children, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, with a
sharp-toned intonation--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you suppose I should come wandering about here by myself? Why
should I not bring all four if I liked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lush/Lush</b></font>)</div>said Lush, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) usual fluent _nonchalance_.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) stayed an hour or so in conference with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and rode back to Diplow
in a state of mind that was at once hopeful and busily anxious as to
the execution of the little plan on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) hopefulness was based.
Grandcourt's marriage to Gwendolen Harleth would not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) believed, be
much of a good to either of them, and it would plainly be fraught with
disagreeables to himself. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) felt confident enough to say
inwardly, <div class="bookquote">``I will take, nay, I will lay odds that the marriage will
never happen.''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIV.

<p/>I will not clothe myself in wreck--wear gems
Sawed from cramped finger-bones of women drowned;
Feel chilly vaporous hands of ireful ghosts
Clutching my necklace: trick my maiden breast
With orphans' heritage. Let your dead love
Marry it's dead.


<p/>Gwendolen looked lovely and vigorous as a tall, newly-opened lily the
next morning: there was a reaction of young energy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and
yesterday's self-distrust seemed no more than the transient shiver on
the surface of a full stream. The roving archery match in Cardell Chase
was a delightful prospect for the sport's sake: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt herself
beforehand moving about like a wood-nymph under the beeches -LRB-in
appreciative company-RRB-, and the imagined scene lent a charm to further
advances on the part of Grandcourt--not an impassioned lyrical Daphnis
for the wood-nymph, certainly: but so much the better. To-day Gwendolen
foresaw him (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) making slow conversational approaches to a declaration, and
foresaw herself awaiting and encouraging it according to the rational
conclusion which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had expressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) came down to breakfast -LRB-after every one had left the table
except Mrs. Davilow-RRB- there were letters on her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) plate. One of them she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
read with a gathering smile, and then handed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) mamma, who, on
returning it, smiled also, finding new cheerfulness in the good spirits
her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) daughter had shown ever since waking, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't feel inclined to go a thousand miles away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly so far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a sad omission not to have written again before this. Can't you
write how--before we set out this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not so pressing. To-morrow will do. You see they leave town
to-day. I must write to Dover. They will be there till Monday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I write for you, dear--if it teases you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen did not speak immediately, but after sipping her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) coffee,
answered brusquely, <div class="bookquote">``Oh no, let it be; I will write to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Then,
feeling a touch of compunction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked up and said with playful
tenderness, <div class="bookquote">``Dear, old, beautiful mamma!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old, child, truly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't, mamma! I meant old for darling. You are hardly
twenty-five years older than I am. When you talk in that way my life
shrivels up before me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One can have a great deal of happiness in twenty-five years, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must lose no time in beginning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, merrily. <div class="bookquote">``The
sooner I get my palaces and coaches the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a good husband who adores you, Gwen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow,
encouragingly.

<p/>Gwendolen put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips saucily and said nothing.

<p/>It was a slight drawback on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pleasure in starting that the rector
was detained by magistrate's business, and would probably not be able
to get to Cardell Chase at all that day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cared little that Mrs.
Gascoigne and Anna chose not to go without him (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) uncle's
presence would have seemed to make it a matter of course that the
decision taken would be acted on. For decision in itself began to be
formidable. Having come close to accepting Grandcourt, Gwendolen felt
this lot of unhoped-for fullness rounding itself too definitely. When
we take to wishing a great deal for ourselves, whatever we get soon
turns into mere limitation and exclusion. Still there was the
reassuring thought that marriage would be the gate into a larger
freedom.

<p/>The place of meeting was a grassy spot called Green Arbor, where a bit
of hanging wood made a sheltering amphitheatre. It was here that the
coachful of servants with provisions had to prepare the picnic meal;
and the warden of the Chase was to guide the roving archers so as to
keep them within the due distance from this centre, and hinder them
from wandering beyond the limit which had been fixed on--a curve that
might be drawn through certain well-known points, such as the double
Oak, the Whispering Stones, and the High Cross. The plan was to take
only a preliminary stroll before luncheon, keeping the main roving
expedition for the more exquisite lights of the afternoon. The muster
was rapid enough to save every one from dull moments of waiting, and
when the groups began to scatter themselves through the light and
shadow made here by closely neighboring beeches and there by rarer
oaks, one may suppose that a painter would have been glad to look on.
This roving archery was far prettier than the stationary game, but
success in shooting at variable marks were less favored by practice,
and the hits were distributed among the volunteer archers otherwise
than they would have been in target-shooting. From this cause, perhaps,
as well as from the twofold distraction of being preoccupied and
wishing not to betray her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) preoccupation, Gwendolen did not greatly
distinguish herself in these first experiments, unless it were by the
lively grace with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) comparative failure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was in
white and green as on the day of the former meeting, when it made an
epoch for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was introduced to Grandcourt; he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was continually
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) side now, yet it would have been hard to tell from mere looks
and manners that their relation to each other had at all changed since
their first conversation. Still there were other grounds that made most
persons conclude them to be, if not engaged already, on the eve of
being so. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) believed this herself. As they were all returning
toward Green Arbor in divergent groups, not thinking at all of taking
aim but merely chattering, words passed which seemed really the
beginning of that end--the beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) acceptance. Grandcourt
said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you know how long it is since I first saw you in this dress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The archery meeting was on the 25th, and this is the 13th,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, laughingly. <div class="bookquote">``I am not good at calculating, but I will
venture to say that it must be nearly three weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A little pause, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``That is a great loss of time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That your knowing me has caused you? Pray don't be uncomplimentary; I
don't like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Pause again. <div class="bookquote">``It is because of the gain that I feel the loss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Gwendolen herself let a pause. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was thinking, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is really
very ingenious. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never speaks stupidly.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) silence was so unusual
that it seemed the strongest of favorable answers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The gain of knowing you makes me feel the time I lose in uncertainty.
Do _you_ like uncertainty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I do, rather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, suddenly beaming on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) with a
playful smile. <div class="bookquote">``There is more in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt met her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) laughing eyes with a slow, steady look right into
them, which seemed like vision in the abstract, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you
mean more torment for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something so strange to Gwendolen in this moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
quite shaken out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) usual self-consciousness. Blushing and turning
away her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``No, that would make me sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt would have followed up this answer, which the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
manner made apparently decisive of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) favorable intention; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was
not in any way overcome so as to be unaware that they were now, within
sight of everybody, descending the space into Green Arbor, and
descending it at an ill-chosen point where it began to be
inconveniently steep. This was a reason for offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Arbor</b></font>) hand in the
literal sense to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) took it, and they came down in silence,
much observed by those already on the level--among others by Mrs.
Arrowpoint, who happened to be standing with Mrs. Davilow. That lady
had now made up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind that Grandcourt's merits were not such as
would have induced Catherine to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), Catherine having so high a
standard as to have refused Lord Slogan. Hence she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked at the tenant
of Diplow with dispassionate eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grandcourt is not equal as a man to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) uncle, Sir Hugo
Mallinger--too languid. To be sure, Mr. Grandcourt is a much younger
man, but I shouldn't wonder if Sir Hugo were to outlive him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>),
notwithstanding the difference of years. It is ill calculating on
successions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>concluded Mrs. Arrowpoint, rather too loudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, able to assent with quiet
cheerfulness, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) was so well satisfied with the actual situation
of affairs that her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) habitual melancholy in their general
unsatisfactoriness was altogether in abeyance.

<p/>I am not concerned to tell of the food that was eaten in that green
refectory, or even to dwell on the stories of the forest scenery that
spread themselves out beyond the level front of the hollow; being just
now bound to tell a story of life at a stage when the blissful beauty
of earth and sky entered only by narrow and oblique inlets into the
consciousness, which was busy with a small social drama almost as
little penetrated by a feeling of wider relations as if it had been a
puppet-show. It will be understood that the food and champagne were of
the best--the talk and laughter too, in the sense of belonging to the
best society, where no one makes an invidious display of anything in
particular, and the advantages of the world are taken with that
high-bred depreciation which follows from being accustomed to them.
Some of the gentlemen strolled a little and indulged in a cigar, there
being a sufficient interval before, four o'clock--the time for
beginning to rove again. Among these, strange to say, was Grandcourt;
but not Mr. Lush, who seemed to be taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) pleasure quite generously
to-day by making himself particularly serviceable, ordering everything
for everybody, and by this activity becoming more than ever a blot on
the scene to Gwendolen, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) kept himself amiably aloof from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
and never even looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) obviously. When there was a general move
to prepare for starting, it appeared that the bows had all been put
under the charge of Lord Brackenshaw's valet, and Mr. Lush was
concerned to save ladies the trouble of fetching theirs from the
carriage where they were propped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) did not intend to bring
Gwendolen's, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), fearful lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) should do so, hurried to fetch it
herself. The valet, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) approach, met her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with it, and in giving
it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand gave also a letter addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) asked no
question about it, perceived at a glance that the address was in a
lady's handwriting -LRB-of the delicate kind which used to be esteemed
feminine before the present uncial period-RRB-, and moving away with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
bow in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, saw Mr. Lush coming to fetch other bows. To avoid
meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned aside and walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) back toward the stand
of carriages, opening the letter. It contained these words--

<p/>If Miss Harleth is in doubt whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) should accept Mr. Grandcourt,
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) break from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) party after they have passed the Whispering
Stones and return to that spot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) will then hear something to decide
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) can only hear it by keeping this letter a strict secret
from every one. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) does not act according to this letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) will
repent, as the woman who writes it has repented. The secrecy Miss
Harleth will feel herself bound in honor to guard.

<p/>Gwendolen felt an inward shock, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) immediate thought was, <div class="bookquote">``It is
come in time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>It lay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) youthfulness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was absorbed by the
idea of the revelation to be made, and had not even a momentary
suspicion of contrivance that could justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in showing the letter.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind gathered itself up at once into the resolution, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would
manage to go unobserved to the Whispering Stones; and thrusting the
letter into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pocket she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned back to rejoin the company, with that
sense of having something to conceal which to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nature had a bracing
quality and helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to be mistress of herself.

<p/>It was a surprise to every one that Grandcourt was not, like the other
smokers, on the spot in time to set out roving with the rest. <div class="bookquote">``We shall
alight on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) by-and-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Brackenshaw/Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div>said Lord Brackenshaw; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) can't be gone
far.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Brackenshaw/Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div>At any rate, no man could be waited for. This apparent
forgetfulness might be taken for the distraction of a lover so absorbed
in thinking of the beloved object as to forget an appointment which
would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) actual presence. And the good-natured Earl
gave Gwendolen a distant jocose hint to that effect, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) took
with suitable quietude. But the thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind was <div class="bookquote">``Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) too be
starting away from a decision?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was not exactly a pleasant thought
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); but it was near the truth. <div class="bookquote">``Starting away,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>however, was not
the right expression for the languor of intention that came over
Grandcourt, like a fit of diseased numbness, when an end seemed within
easy reach: to desist then, when all expectation was to the contrary,
became another gratification of mere will, sublimely independent of
definite motive. At that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) had begun a second large cigar in a
vague, hazy obstinacy which, if Lush or any other mortal who might be
insulted with impunity had interrupted by overtaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) with a request
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) return, would have expressed itself by a slow removal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>)
cigar, to say in an undertone, <div class="bookquote">``You'll be kind enough to go to the
devil, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) was not interrupted, and the rovers set off without any visible
depression of spirits, leaving behind only a few of the less vigorous
ladies, including Mrs. Davilow, who preferred a quiet stroll free from
obligation to keep up with others. The enjoyment of the day was soon at
its highest pitch, the archery getting more spirited and the changing
scenes of the forest from roofed grove to open glade growing lovelier
with the lengthening shadows, and the deeply-felt but undefinable
gradations of the mellowing afternoon. It was agreed that they were
playing an extemporized <div class="bookquote">``As you like it;''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>and when a pretty compliment
had been turned to Gwendolen about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) having the part of Rosalind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
felt the more compelled to be surpassing in loveliness. This was not
very difficult to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), for the effect of what had happened to-day was
an excitement which needed a vent--a sense of adventure rather than
alarm, and a straining toward the management of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) retreat, so as not
to be impeded.

<p/>The roving had been lasting nearly an hour before the arrival at the
Whispering Stones, two tall conical blocks that leaned toward each
other like gigantic gray-mantled figures. They were soon surveyed and
passed by with the remark that they would be good ghosts on a starlit
night. But a soft sunlight was on them now, and Gwendolen felt daring.
The stones were near a fine grove of beeches, where the archers found
plenty of marks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How far are we from Green Arbor now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, having got in
front by the side of the warden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not more than half a mile, taking along the avenue we're going to
cross up there: but I shall take round a Couple of miles, by the High
Cross.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was falling back among the rest, when suddenly they seemed all to
be hurrying obliquely forward under the guidance of Mr. Lush, and
lingering a little where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) opportunity of
slipping away. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was out of sight, and without running she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
seemed to herself to fly along the ground and count the moments nothing
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found herself back again at the Whispering Stones. They turned
their blank gray sides to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): what was there on the other side? If
there were nothing after all? That was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) only dread now--to have to
turn back again in mystification; and walking round the right-hand
stone without pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found herself in front of some one whose large
dark eyes met hers at a foot's distance. In spite of expectation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was startled and shrank bank, but in doing so she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could take in the
whole figure of this stranger and perceive that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was unmistakably a
lady, and one who must have been exceedingly handsome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) perceived,
also, that a few yards from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were two children seated on the grass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Harleth?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>All Gwendolen's consciousness was wonder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you accepted Mr. Grandcourt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have promised to tell you something. And you will promise to keep my
secret. However you may decide you will not tell Mr. Grandcourt, or any
one else, that you have seen me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Lydia Glasher. Mr. Grandcourt ought not to marry any one
but me. I left my husband and child for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) nine years ago. Those two
children are his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and we have two others--girls--who are older. My
husband is dead now, and Mr. Grandcourt ought to marry me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) ought to
make that boy his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) heir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked at the boy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoke, and Gwendolen's eyes followed hers.
The handsome little fellow was puffing out his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cheeks in trying to blow
a tiny trumpet which remained dumb. His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hat hung backward by a string,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) brown curls caught the sun-rays. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was a cherub.

<p/>The two women's eyes met again, and Gwendolen said proudly, <div class="bookquote">``I will not
interfere with your wishes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were shivering, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips were pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very attractive, Miss Harleth. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) first knew me, I
too was young. Since then my life has been broken up and embittered. It
is not fair that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should be happy and I miserable, and my boy thrust
out of sight for another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>These words were uttered with a biting accent, but with a determined
abstinence from anything violent in tone or manner. Gwendolen, watching
Mrs. Glasher's face while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoke, felt a sort of terror: it was as
if some ghastly vision had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in a dream and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am a
woman's life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you anything more to say to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) asked in a low tone, but
still proud and coldly. The revulsion within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not tending to
soften her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Everyone seemed hateful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. You know what I wished you to know. You can inquire about me
if you like. My husband was Colonel Glasher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, moving away with a ceremonious
inclination, which was returned with equal grace.

<p/>In a few minutes Gwendolen was in the beech grove again but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) party
had gone out of sight and apparently had not sent in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), for
all was solitude till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had reached the avenue pointed out by the
warden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) determined to take this way back to Green Arbor, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
reached quickly; rapid movements seeming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) just now a means of
suspending the thoughts which might prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from behaving with due
calm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had already made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind what step she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would take.

<p/>Mrs. Davilow was of course astonished to see Gwendolen returning alone,
and was not without some uneasiness which the presence of other ladies
hindered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from showing. In answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) words of surprise Gwendolen
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have been rather silly. I lingered behind to look at the
Whispering Stones, and the rest hurried on after something, so I lost
sight of them. I thought it best to come home by the short way--the
avenue that the warden had told me of. I'm not sorry after all. I had
had enough walking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your party did not meet Mr. Grandcourt, I presume,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Arrowpoint, not without intention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a little flash of defiance, and a light
laugh. <div class="bookquote">``And we didn't see any carvings on the trees, either. Where can
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) be? I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) has fallen into the pool or had an apoplectic
fit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>With all Gwendolen's resolve not to betray any agitation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not
help it that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tone was unusually high and hard, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother felt
sure that something unpropitious had happened.

<p/>Mrs. Arrowpoint thought that the self-confident young lady was much
piqued, and that Mr. Grandcourt was probably seeing reason to change
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have no objection, mamma, I will order the carriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I am tired. And every one will be going soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow assented; but by the time the carriage was announced as,
ready--the horses having to be fetched from the stables on the warden's
premises--the roving party reappeared, and with them Mr. Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Brackenshaw/Brackenshaw</b></font>)</div>said Lord Brackenshaw, going up to Gwendolen, who
was arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's shawl for the drive. <div class="bookquote">``We thought at first you
had alighted on Grandcourt and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had taken you home. Lush said so. But
after that we met Grandcourt. However, we didn't suppose you could be
in any danger. The warden said he (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) had told you a near way back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, coming up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) usual air, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not conceive that there had been any omission on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) part. Lord
Brackenshaw gave place to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) and moved away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we are going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, looking busily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) scarf, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was arranging across her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) shoulders Scotch fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I call at Offendene to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, sweeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) from a distance
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyelashes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) voice was light and sharp as the first touch of
frost.

<p/>Mrs. Davilow accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) arm to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) to the carriage; but while
that was happening, Gwendolen with incredible swiftness had got in
advance of them, and had sprung into the carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got in, mamma, because I wished to be on this side,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said,
apologetically. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had avoided Grandcourt's touch: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) only lifted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hat and walked away--with the not unsatisfactory impression that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meant to show herself offended by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) neglect.

<p/>The mother and daughter drove for five minutes in silence. Then
Gwendolen said, <div class="bookquote">``I intend to join the Langens at Dover, mamma. I shall
pack up immediately on getting home, and set off by the early train. I
shall be at Dover almost as soon as they are; we can let them know by
telegraph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens, child! what can be your reason for saying so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My reason for saying it, mamma, is that I mean to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why do you mean to do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it because you are offended with Mr. Grandcourt's odd behavior in
walking off to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is useless to enter into such questions. I am not going in any case
to marry Mr. Grandcourt. Don't interest yourself further about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I say to your uncle, Gwendolen? Consider the position you
place me in. You led him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to believe only last night that you had made
up your mind in favor of Mr. Grandcourt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry to cause you annoyance, mamma, dear, but I can't help
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with still harder resistance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tone.
<div class="bookquote">``Whatever you or my uncle may think or do, I shall not alter my
resolve, and I shall not tell my reason. I don't care what comes of it.
I don't care if I never marry any one. There is nothing worth caring
for. I believe all men are bad, and I hate them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But need you set off in this way, Gwendolen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow,
miserable and helpless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now mamma, don't interfere with me. If you have ever had any trouble
in your own life, remember it and don't interfere with me. If I am to
be miserable, let it be by my own choice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The mother was reduced to trembling silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began to see that the
difficulty would be lessened if Gwendolen went away.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did go. The packing was all carefully done that evening, and
not long after dawn the next day Mrs. Davilow accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) daughter
to the railway station. The sweet dews of morning, the cows and horses
looking over the hedges without any particular reason, the early
travelers on foot with their bundles, seemed all very melancholy and
purposeless to them both. The dingy torpor of the railway station,
before the ticket could be taken, was still worse. Gwendolen had
certainly hardened in the last twenty-four hours: her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's trouble
evidently counted for little in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) present state of mind, which did
not essentially differ from the mood that makes men take to worse
conduct when their belief in persons or things is upset. Gwendolen's
uncontrolled reading, though consisting chiefly in what are called
pictures of life, had somehow not prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) for this encounter with
reality. Is that surprising? It is to be believed that attendance at
the _opéra bouffe_ in the present day would not leave men's minds
entirely without shock, if the manners observed there with some
applause were suddenly to start up in their own families. Perspective,
as its inventor remarked, is a beautiful thing. What horrors of damp
huts, where human beings languish, may not become picturesque through
aerial distance! What hymning of cancerous vices may we not languish
over as sublimest art in the safe remoteness of a strange language and
artificial phrase! Yet we keep a repugnance to rheumatism and other
painful effects when presented incur personal experience.

<p/>Mrs. Davilow felt Gwendolen's new phase of indifference keenly, and as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) drove back alone, the brightening morning was sadder to her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) than
before.

<p/>Mr. Grandcourt called that day at Offendene, but nobody was at home.




<p/>CHAPTER XV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Festina lente_--celerity should be contempered with
cunctation.'' (<font color='red'><b>CHAPTER XV</b></font>)</div>--SIR THOMAS BROWNE.


<p/>Gwendolen, we have seen, passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) time abroad in the new excitement
of gambling, and in imagining herself an empress of luck, having
brought from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) late experience a vague impression that in this
confused world it signified nothing what any one did, so that they
amused themselves. We have seen, too, that certain persons,
mysteriously symbolized as Grapnell & Co., having also thought of
reigning in the realm of luck, and being also bent on amusing
themselves, no matter how, had brought about a painful change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
family circumstances; whence she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had returned home--carrying with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) inclination, a necklace which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had pawned and some one
else had redeemed.

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was going back to England, Grandcourt was coming to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>);
coming, that is, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own manner--not in haste by express straight
from Diplow to Leubronn, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was understood to be; but so
entirely without hurry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was induced by the presence of some
Russian acquaintances to linger at Baden-Baden and make various
appointments with them, which, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) desire to be at Leubronn
ultimately caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to break. Grandcourt's passions were of the
intermittent, flickering kind: never flaming out strongly. But a great
deal of life goes on without strong passion: myriads of cravats are
carefully tied, dinners attended, even speeches made proposing the
health of august personages without the zest arising from a strong
desire. And a man may make a good appearance in high social
positions--may be supposed to know the classics, to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reserves
on science, a strong though repressed opinion on politics, and all the
sentiments of the English gentleman, at a small expense of vital
energy. Also, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) may be obstinate or persistent at the same low rate,
and may even show sudden impulses which have a false air of daemonic
strength because they seem inexplicable, though perhaps their secret
lies merely in the want of regulated channels for the soul to move
in--good and sufficient ducts of habit without which our nature easily
turns to mere ooze and mud, and at any pressure yields nothing but a
spurt or a puddle.

<p/>Grandcourt had not been altogether displeased by Gwendolen's running
away from the splendid chance he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was holding out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). The act had
some piquancy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) liked to think that it was due to resentment
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) careless behavior in Cardell Chase, which, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) came to
consider it, did appear rather cool. To have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) so near a
tender admission, and then to have walked headlong away from further
opportunities of winning the consent which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) understand
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to be asking for, was enough to provoke a girl of spirit; and to be
worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mastering it was proper that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should have some spirit.
Doubtless she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meant him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and it was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) meant too.
But for a whole week he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) took no measures toward starting, and did not
even inquire where Miss Harleth was gone. Mr. Lush felt a triumph that
was mingled with much distrust; for Grandcourt had said no word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>), and looked as neutral as an alligator; there was no telling
what might turn up in the slowly-churning chances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mind. Still,
to have put off a decision was to have made room for the waste of
Grandcourt's energy.

<p/>The guests at Diplow felt more curiosity than their host. How was it
that nothing more was heard of Miss Harleth? Was it credible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>)
had refused Mr. Grandcourt? Lady Flora Hollis, a lively middle-aged
woman, well endowed with curiosity, felt a sudden interest in making a
round of calls with Mrs. Torrington, including the rectory, Offendene,
and Quetcham, and thus not only got twice over, but also discussed with
the Arrowpoints, the information that Miss Harleth was gone to
Leubronn, with some old friends, the Baron and Baroness von Langen; for
the immediate agitation and disappointment of Mrs. Davilow and the
Gascoignes had resolved itself into a wish that Gwendolen's
disappearance should not be interpreted as anything eccentric or
needful to be kept secret. The rector's mind, indeed, entertained the
possibility that the marriage was only a little deferred, for Mrs.
Davilow had not dared to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) of the bitter determination with
which Gwendolen had spoken. And in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) practical ability, some
of his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) experience had petrified into maxims and quotations. Amaryllis
fleeing desired that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hiding-place should be known; and that love
will find out the way <div class="bookquote">``over the mountain and over the wave''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>may be said
without hyperbole in this age of steam. Gwendolen, he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) conceived, was an
Amaryllis of excellent sense but coquettish daring; the question was
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had dared too much.

<p/>Lady Flora, coming back charged with news about Miss Harleth, saw no
good reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) should not try whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) could electrify Mr.
Grandcourt by mentioning it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) at the table; and in doing so shot a
few hints of a notion having got abroad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was a disappointed
adorer. Grandcourt heard with quietude, but with attention; and the
next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) ordered Lush to bring about a decent reason for breaking up
the party at Diplow by the end of another week, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) meant to go
yachting to the Baltic or somewhere--it being impossible to stay at
Diplow as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) were a prisoner on parole, with a set of people whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
had never wanted. Lush needed no clearer announcement that Grandcourt
was going to Leubronn; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) might go after the manner of a creeping
billiard-ball and stick on the way. What Mr. Lush intended was to make
himself indispensable so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) might go too, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) succeeded;
Gwendolen's repulsion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) being a fact that only amused his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) patron,
and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) none the less willing to have Lush always at hand.

<p/>This was how it happened that Grandcourt arrived at the _Czarina_ on
the fifth day after Gwendolen had left Leubronn, and found there his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
uncle, Sir Hugo Mallinger, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) family, including Deronda. It is
not necessarily a pleasure either to the reigning power or the heir
presumptive when their separate affairs--a--touch of gout, say, in the
one, and a touch of willfulness in the other--happen to bring them to
the same spot. Sir Hugo was an easy-tempered man, tolerant both of
differences and defects; but a point of view different from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) own
concerning the settlement of the family estates fretted him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) rather more
than if it had concerned Church discipline or the ballot, and faults
were the less venial for belonging to a person whose existence was
inconvenient to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>). In no case could Grandcourt have been a nephew
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own heart; but as the presumptive heir to the Mallinger
estates he (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) was the sign and embodiment of a chief grievance in the
baronet's life--the want of a son to inherit the lands, in no portion
of which had he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) himself more than a life-interest. For in the
ill-advised settlement which his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, Sir Francis, had chosen to
make by will, even Diplow with its modicum of land had been left under
the same conditions as the ancient and wide inheritance of the two
Toppings--Diplow, where Sir Hugo had lived and hunted through many a
season in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) younger years, and where his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) wife and daughters ought to
have been able to retire after his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) death.

<p/>This grievance had naturally gathered emphasis as the years advanced,
and Lady Mallinger, after having had three daughters in quick
succession, had remained for eight years till now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) was over
forty without producing so much as another girl; while Sir Hugo, almost
twenty years older, was at a time of life when, notwithstanding the
fashionable retardation of most things from dinners to marriages, a
man's hopefulness is apt to show signs of wear, until restored by
second childhood.

<p/>In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had begun to despair of a son, and this confirmation of
Grandcourt's interest in the estates certainly tended to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) image
and presence the more unwelcome; but, on the other hand, it carried
circumstances which disposed Sir Hugo to take care that the relation
between them should be kept as friendly as possible. It led him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) to
dwell on a plan which had grown up side by side with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) disappointment
of an heir; namely, to try and secure Diplow as a future residence for
Lady Mallinger and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) daughters, and keep this pretty bit of the
family inheritance for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) own offspring in spite of that
disappointment. Such knowledge as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) nephew's disposition
and affairs encouraged the belief that Grandcourt might consent to a
transaction by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would get a good sum of ready money, as an
equivalent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) prospective interest in the domain of Diplow and the
moderate amount of land attached to it. If, after all, the unhoped-for
son should be born, the money would have been thrown away, and
Grandcourt would have been paid for giving up interests that had turned
out good for nothing; but Sir Hugo set down this risk as _nil_, and of
late years he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had husbanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) fortune so well by the working of mines
and the sale of leases that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was prepared for an outlay.

<p/>Here was an object that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) careful to avoid any quarrel with
Grandcourt. Some years before, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was making improvements at the
Abbey, and needed Grandcourt's concurrence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) felling an
obstructive mass of timber on the demesne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had congratulated himself
on finding that there was no active spite against him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) nephew's
peculiar mind; and nothing had since occurred to make them hate each
other more than was compatible with perfect politeness, or with any
accommodation that could be strictly mutual.

<p/>Grandcourt, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) side, thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) uncle a superfluity and a bore,
and felt that the list of things in general would be improved whenever
Sir Hugo came to be expunged. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had been made aware through Lush,
always a useful medium, of the baronet's inclinations concerning
Diplow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was gratified to have the alternative of the money in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) mind: even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had not thought it in the least likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
would choose to accept it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) sense of power would have been flattered
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) being able to refuse what Sir Hugo desired. The hinted
transaction had told for something among the motives which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
ask for a year's tenancy of Diplow, which it had rather annoyed Sir
Hugo to grant, because the excellent hunting in the neighborhood might
decide Grandcourt not to part with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) chance of future possession;--a
man who has two places, in one of which the hunting is less good,
naturally desiring a third where it is better. Also, Lush had thrown
out to Sir Hugo the probability that Grandcourt would woo and win Miss
Arrowpoint, and in that case ready money might be less of a temptation
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). Hence, on this unexpected meeting at Leubronn, the baronet felt
much curiosity to know how things had been going on at Diplow, was bent
on being as civil as possible to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) nephew, and looked forward to some
private chat with Lush.

<p/>Between Deronda and Grandcourt there was a more faintly-marked but
peculiar relation, depending on circumstances which have yet to be made
known. But on no side was there any sign of suppressed chagrin on the
first meeting at the _table d'hôte_, an hour after Grandcourt's
arrival; and when the quartette of gentlemen afterward met on the
terrace, without Lady Mallinger, they moved off together to saunter
through the rooms, Sir Hugo saying as they entered the large _saal_--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you play much at Baden, Grandcourt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I looked on and betted a little with some Russians there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you luck?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I win, Lush?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You brought away about two hundred,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Lush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not here for the sake of the play, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't care about play now. It's a confounded strain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt, whose diamond ring and demeanor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) moved along playing
slightly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) whisker, were being a good deal stared at by rouged
foreigners interested in a new milord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is, somebody should invent a mill to do amusements for you,
my dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, <div class="bookquote">``as the Tartars get their praying done.
But I agree with you; I never cared for play. It's monotonous--knits
the brain up into meshes. And it knocks me up to watch it now. I
suppose one gets poisoned with the bad air. I never stay here more than
ten minutes. But where's your gambling beauty, Deronda? Have you seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) lately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'s gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, curtly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An uncommonly fine girl, a perfect Diana,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, turning to
Grandcourt again. <div class="bookquote">``Really worth a little straining to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>). I
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) winning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) took it as coolly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had known it all
beforehand. The same day Deronda happened to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) losing like
wildfire, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) bore it with immense pluck. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was cleaned
out, or was wise enough to stop in time. How do you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'s gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, by the Visitor-list,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with a scarcely perceptible
shrug. <div class="bookquote">``Vandernoodt told me her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) name was Harleth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was with the
Baron and Baroness von Langen. I saw by the list that Miss Harleth was
no longer there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>This held no further information for Lush than that Gwendolen had been
gambling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had already looked at the list, and ascertained that
Gwendolen had gone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had no intention of thrusting this knowledge
on Grandcourt before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) asked for it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not asked, finding it
enough to believe that the object of search would turn up somewhere or
other.

<p/>But now Grandcourt had heard what was rather piquant, and not a word
about Miss Harleth had been missed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). After a moment's pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
said to Deronda--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know those people--the Langens?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have talked with them a little since Miss Harleth went away. I knew
nothing of them before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) gone--do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) is gone home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, coldly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wished to say no
more. But then, from a fresh impulse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) turned to look markedly at
Grandcourt, and added, <div class="bookquote">``But it is possible you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) home is
not far from Diplow: Offendene, near Winchester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda, turning to look straight at Grandcourt, who was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) left
hand, might have been a subject for those old painters who liked
contrasts of temperament. There was a calm intensity of life and
richness of tint in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face that on a sudden gaze from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was rather
startling, and often made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) seem to have spoken, so that servants and
officials asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) automatically, <div class="bookquote">``What did you say, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had
been quite silent. Grandcourt himself felt an irritation, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did
not show except by a slight movement of the eyelids, at Deronda's
turning round on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not asked to do more than speak. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answered, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) usual drawl, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and paused with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shoulder toward Deronda, to look at the gambling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>), eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Hugo</b></font>)</div>asked Sir Hugo of Lush, as the three moved on a
little way. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) must be a new-comer at Offendene. Old Blenny lived
there after the dowager died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little too much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Lush, in a low, significant tone; not
sorry to let Sir Hugo know the state of affairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? how?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet. They all moved out of the _salon_ into an
airy promenade.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) has been on the brink of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Lush went on. <div class="bookquote">``But I hope
it's off now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>)'s a niece of the clergyman--Gascoigne--at Pennicote.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) mother is a widow with a brood of daughters. This girl will have
nothing, and is as dangerous as gunpowder. It would be a foolish
marriage. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has taken a freak against him (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ran off here
without notice, when he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) had agreed to call the next day. The fact is,
he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>)'s here after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) was in no great hurry, and between his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>)
caprice and hers they are likely enough not to get together again. But
of course he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) chance with the heiress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt joining them said, <div class="bookquote">``What a beastly den this is!--a worse
hole than Baden. I shall go back to the hotel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>When Sir Hugo and Deronda were alone, the baronet began--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather a pretty story. That girl has something in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be
worth running after--has _de l'imprévu_. I think her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) appearance on the
scene has bettered my chance of getting Diplow, whether the marriage
comes off or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hope a marriage like that would not come off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
in a tone of disgust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! are you a little touched with the sublime lash?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo,
putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) glasses to help his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) short sight in looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
companion. <div class="bookquote">``Are you inclined to run after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``I should rather be inclined to run
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you would easily cut out Grandcourt. A girl with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spirit would
think you the finer match of the two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, who often tried
Deronda's patience by finding a joke in impossible advice. -LRB-A
difference of taste in jokes is a great strain on the affections.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose pedigree and land belong to a fine match,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The best horse will win in spite of pedigree, my boy. You remember
Napoleon's _mot--Je suis un ancêtre_''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, who habitually
undervalued birth, as men after dining well often agree that the good
of life is distributed with wonderful equality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I want to be an ancestor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``It
doesn't seem to me the rarest sort of origination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't run after the pretty gambler, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, putting
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) glasses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This answer was perfectly truthful; nevertheless it had passed through
Deronda's mind that under other circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should have given way
to the interest this girl had raised in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and tried to know more of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). But his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) history had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) a stronger bias in another
direction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt himself in no sense free.




<p/>CHAPTER XVI.

<p/>Men, like planets, have both a visible and an invisible history. The
astronomer threads the darkness with strict deduction, accounting so
for every visible arc in the wanderer's orbit; and the narrator of
human actions, if he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) work with the same completeness, would
have to thread the hidden pathways of feeling and thought which lead
up to every moment of action, and to those moments of intense
suffering which take the quality of action--like the cry of
Prometheus, whose chained anguish seems a greater energy than the sea
and sky he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) invokes and the deity he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) defies.


<p/>Deronda's circumstances, indeed, had been exceptional. One moment had
been burned into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life as its chief epoch--a moment full of July
sunshine and large pink roses shedding their last petals on a grassy
court enclosed on three sides by a gothic cloister. Imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in such
a scene: a boy of thirteen, stretched prone on the grass where it was
in shadow, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) curly head propped on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms over a book, while his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
tutor, also reading, sat on a camp-stool under shelter. Deronda's book
was Sismondi's <div class="bookquote">``History of the Italian Republics'' (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>;--the lad had a
passion for history, eager to know how time had been filled up since
the flood, and how things were carried on in the dull periods. Suddenly
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) let down his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) left arm and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) tutor, saying in purest
boyish tones--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fraser, how was it that the popes and cardinals always had so many
nephews?''

 (<font color='red'><b>tutor</b></font>)</div><p/>The tutor, an able young Scotchman, who acted as Sir Hugo Mallinger's
secretary, roused rather unwillingly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) political economy,
answered with the clear-cut emphatic chant which makes a truth doubly
telling in Scotch utterance--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Their own children were called nephews.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Scotch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was just for the propriety of the thing; because, as you know very
well, priests don't marry, and the children were illegitimate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fraser/Fraser</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Fraser, thrusting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) lower lip and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) chant of the
last word the more emphatic for a little impatience at being
interrupted, had already turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) book again, while
Deronda, as if something had stung him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), started up in a sitting
attitude with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) back to the tutor.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had always called Sir Hugo Mallinger his (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) uncle, and when it once
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) to ask about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) father and mother, the baronet had
answered, <div class="bookquote">``You lost your father and mother when you were quite a little
one; that is why I take care of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>Daniel then straining to discern
something in that early twilight, had a dim sense of having been kissed
very much, and surrounded by thin, cloudy, scented drapery, till his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>)
fingers caught in something hard, which hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) began to cry.
Every other memory he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had was of the little world in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) still
lived. And at that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) did not mind about learning more, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was
too fond of Sir Hugo to be sorry for the loss of unknown parents. Life
was very delightful to the lad, with an uncle who was always indulgent
and cheerful--a fine man in the bright noon of life, whom Daniel
thought absolutely perfect, and whose place was one of the finest in
England, at once historical; romantic, and home-like: a picturesque
architectural outgrowth from an abbey, which had still remnants of the
old monastic trunk. Diplow lay in another county, and was a
comparatively landless place which had come into the family from a rich
lawyer on the female side who wore the perruque of the restoration;
whereas the Mallingers had the grant of Monk's Topping under Henry the
Eighth, and ages before had held the neighboring lands of King's
Topping, tracing indeed their origin to a certain Hugues le Malingre,
who came in with the Conqueror--and also apparently with a sickly
complexion which had been happily corrected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Conqueror</b></font>) descendants. Two
rows of these descendants, direct and collateral, females of the male
line, and males of the female, looked down in the gallery over the
cloisters on the nephew Daniel as he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) walked there: men in armor with
pointed beards and arched eyebrows, pinched ladies in hoops and ruffs
with no face to speak of; grave-looking men in black velvet and stuffed
hips, and fair, frightened women holding little boys by the hand;
smiling politicians in magnificent perruques, and ladies of the
prize-animal kind, with rosebud mouths and full eyelids, according to
Lely; then a generation whose faces were revised and embellished in the
taste of Kneller; and so on through refined editions of the family
types in the time of Reynolds and Romney, till the line ended with Sir
Hugo and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) younger brother Henleigh. This last had married Miss
Grandcourt, and taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) name along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) estates, thus making a
junction between two equally old families, impaling the three Saracens'
heads proper and three bezants of the one with the tower and falcons
_argent_ of the other, and, as it happened, uniting their highest
advantages in the prospects of that Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt who
is at present more of an acquaintance to us than either Sir Hugo or his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
nephew Daniel Deronda.

<p/>In Sir Hugo's youthful portrait with rolled collar and high cravat, Sir
Thomas Lawrence had done justice to the agreeable alacrity of
expression and sanguine temperament still to be seen in the original,
but had done something more than justice in slightly lengthening the
nose, which was in reality shorter than might have been expected in a
Mallinger. Happily the appropriate nose of the family reappeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>)
younger brother, and was to be seen in all its refined regularity in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) nephew Mallinger Grandcourt. But in the nephew Daniel Deronda the
family faces of various types, seen on the walls of the gallery; found
no reflex. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was handsomer than any of them, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
thirteen might have served as model for any painter who wanted to image
the most memorable of boys: you could hardly have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face
thoroughly meeting yours without believing that human creatures had
done nobly in times past, and might do more nobly in time to come. The
finest childlike faces have this consecrating power, and make us
shudder anew at all the grossness and basely-wrought griefs of the
world, lest they should enter here and defile.

<p/>But at this moment on the grass among the rose-petals, Daniel Deronda
was making a first acquaintance with those griefs. A new idea had
entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind, and was beginning to change the aspect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
habitual feelings as happy careless voyagers are changed with the sky
suddenly threatened and the thought of danger arises. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sat perfectly
still with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) back to the tutor, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face expressed rapid inward
transition. The deep blush, which had come when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) first started up,
gradually subsided; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) features kept that indescribable look of
subdued activity which often accompanies a new mental survey of
familiar facts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not lived with other boys, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind showed
the same blending of child's ignorance with surprising knowledge which
is oftener seen in bright girls. Having read Shakespeare as well as a
great deal of history, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) could have talked with the wisdom of a
bookish child about men who were born out of wedlock and were held
unfortunate in consequence, being under disadvantages which required
them to be a sort of heroes if they were to work themselves up to an
equal standing with their legally born brothers. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) had never
brought such knowledge into any association with his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) own lot, which had
been too easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) ever to think about it--until this moment when
there had darted into his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) mind with the magic of quick comparison, the
possibility that here was the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) own birth, and that the man
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) called uncle was really his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) father. Some children, even younger
than Daniel, have known the first arrival of care, like an ominous
irremovable guest in their tender lives, on the discovery that their
parents, whom they had imagined able to buy everything, were poor and
in hard money troubles. Daniel felt the presence of a new guest who
seemed to come with an enigmatic veiled face, and to carry
dimly-conjectured, dreaded revelations. The ardor which he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had given to
the imaginary world in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) books suddenly rushed toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) own history
and spent its pictorial energy there, explaining what he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) knew,
representing the unknown. The uncle whom he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) loved very dearly took the
aspect of a father who held secrets about him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)--who had done him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) a
wrong--yes, a wrong: and what had become of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mother, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
must have been taken away?--Secrets about which he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), Daniel, could never
inquire; for to speak or to be spoken to about these new thoughts
seemed like falling flakes of fire to his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) imagination. Those who have
known an impassioned childhood will understand this dread of utterance
about any shame connected with their parents. The impetuous advent of
new images took possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) with the force of fact for the first
time told, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) no immediate power for the reflection that he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>)
might be trembling at a fiction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) own. The terrible sense of
collision between a strong rush of feeling and the dread of its
betrayal, found relief at length in big slow tears, which fell without
restraint until the voice of Mr. Fraser was heard saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Daniel, do you see that you are sitting on the bent pages of your
book?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fraser/Fraser</b></font>)</div><p/>Daniel immediately moved the book without turning round, and after
holding it before him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) for an instant, rose with it and walked away into
the open grounds, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) could dry his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) tears unobserved. The first
shock of suggestion past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) could remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had no certainty
how things really had been, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had been making conjectures
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) own history, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had often made stories about Pericles or
Columbus, just to fill up the blanks before they became famous. Only
there came back certain facts which had an obstinate reality,--almost
like the fragments of a bridge, telling you unmistakably how the arches
lay. And again there came a mood in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) conjectures seemed like a
doubt of religion, to be banished as an offense, and a mean prying
after what he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was not meant to know; for there was hardly a delicacy of
feeling this lad was not capable of. But the summing-up of all his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
fluctuating experience at this epoch was, that a secret impression had
come to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) which had given him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) something like a new sense in relation
to all the elements of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) life. And the idea that others probably knew
things concerning which they did not choose to mention, set up in him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) a
premature reserve which helped to intensify his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) inward experience. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
ears open now to words which before that July day would have passed by
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) unnoted; and round every trivial incident which imagination could
connect with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) suspicions, a newly-roused set of feelings were ready
to cluster themselves.

<p/>One such incident a month later wrought itself deeply into his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) life.
Daniel had not only one of those thrilling boy voices which seem to
bring an idyllic heaven and earth before our eyes, but a fine musical
instinct, and had early made out accompaniments for himself on the
piano, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) sang from memory. Since then he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had had some teaching,
and Sir Hugo, who delighted in the boy, used to ask for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) music in
the presence of guests. One morning after he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had been singing <div class="bookquote">``Sweet
Echo''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>before a small party of gentlemen whom the rain had kept in the
house, the baronet, passing from a smiling remark to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) next neighbor
said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here, Dan!''

 (<font color='red'><b>neighbor</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy came forward with unusual reluctance. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wore an embroidered
holland blouse which set off the rich coloring of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head and throat,
and the resistant gravity about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth and eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was being
smiled upon, made their beauty the more impressive. Every one was
admiring him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say to being a great singer? Should you like to be adored
by the world and take the house by storm; like Mario and Tamberlik?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Daniel reddened instantaneously, but there was a just perceptible
interval before he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) answered with angry decision--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I should hate it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, with surprised kindliness intended
to be soothing. But Daniel turned away quickly, left the room, and
going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) own chamber threw himself on the broad window-sill, which
was a favorite retreat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had nothing particular to do.
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) could see the rain gradually subsiding with gleams through the
parting clouds which lit up a great reach of the park, where the old
oaks stood apart from each other, and the bordering wood was pierced
with a green glade which met the eastern sky. This was a scene which
had always been part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) home--part of the dignified ease which had
been a matter of course in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) life. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) ardent clinging nature had
appropriated it all with affection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) knew a great deal of what it was
to be a gentleman by inheritance, and without thinking much about
himself--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was a boy of active perceptions and easily forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>)
own existence in that of Robert Bruce--he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had never supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>)
could be shut out from such a lot, or have a very different part in the
world from that of the uncle who petted him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). It is possible -LRB-though not
greatly believed in at present-RRB- to be fond of poverty and take it for a
bride, to prefer scoured deal, red quarries and whitewash for one's
private surroundings, to delight in no splendor but what has open doors
for the whole nation, and to glory in having no privileges except such
as nature insists on; and noblemen have been known to run away from
elaborate ease and the option of idleness, that they might bind
themselves for small pay to hard-handed labor. But Daniel's tastes were
altogether in keeping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) nurture: his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) disposition was one in
which everyday scenes and habits beget not _ennui_ or rebellion, but
delight, affection, aptitudes; and now the lad had been stung to the
quick by the idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) uncle--perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father--thought of a
career for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) which was totally unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) knew very
well was not thought of among possible destinations for the sons of
English gentlemen. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had often stayed in London with Sir Hugo, who to
indulge the boy's ear had carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) to the opera to hear the great
tenors, so that the image of a singer taking the house by storm was
very vivid to him (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>); but now, spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) musical gift, he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) set himself
bitterly against the notion of being dressed up to sing before all
those fine people, who would not care about him (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) except as a wonderful
toy. That Sir Hugo should have thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) in that position for a
moment, seemed to Daniel an unmistakable proof that there was something
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) birth which threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) out from the class of gentlemen to
which the baronet belonged. Would it ever be mentioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>)? Would
the time come when his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) uncle would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) everything? He (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) shrank from
the prospect: in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) imagination he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) preferred ignorance. If his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) father
had been wicked--Daniel inwardly used strong words, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was feeling
the injury done him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) as a maimed boy feels the crushed limb which for
others is merely reckoned in an average of accidents--if his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father had
done any wrong, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wished it might never be spoken of to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>): it was
already a cutting thought that such knowledge might be in other minds.
Was it in Mr. Fraser's? probably not, else he (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) would not have spoken in
that way about the pope's nephews. Daniel fancied, as older people do,
that every one else's consciousness was as active as his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) own on a
matter which was vital to him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>). Did Turvey the valet know?--and old Mrs.
French the housekeeper?--and Banks the bailiff, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) had ridden
about the farms on his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) pony?--And now there came back the recollection
of a day some years before when he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) was drinking Mrs. Banks's whey, and
Banks said to his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) wife with a wink and a cunning laugh, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mario</b></font>) features
the mother, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>At that time little Daniel had merely thought that
Banks made a silly face, as the common farming men often did, laughing
at what was not laughable; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) rather resented being winked at and
talked of as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) did not understand everything. But now that small
incident became information: it was to be reasoned on. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) be
like his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) mother and not like his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) father? His (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) mother must have been a
Mallinger, if Sir Hugo were his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) uncle. But no! His (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) father might have
been Sir Hugo's brother and have changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) name, as Mr. Henleigh
Mallinger did when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) married Miss Grandcourt. But then, why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
never heard Sir Hugo speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) brother Deronda, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
brother Grandcourt? Daniel had never before cared about the family
tree--only about that ancestor who had killed three Saracens in one
encounter. But now his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) mind turned to a cabinet of estate-maps in the
library, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had once seen an illuminated parchment hanging out,
that Sir Hugo said was the family tree. The phrase was new and odd to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was a little fellow then--hardly more than half his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) present
age--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) gave it no precise meaning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) knew more now and wished
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) could examine that parchment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) imagined that the cabinet was
always locked, and longed to try it. But here he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) checked himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
might be seen: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) would never bring himself near even a silent
admission of the sore that had opened in him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>).

<p/>It is in such experiences of a boy or girlhood, while elders are
debating whether most education lies in science or literature, that the
main lines of character are often laid down. If Daniel had been of a
less ardently affectionate nature, the reserve about himself and the
supposition that others had something to his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) disadvantage in their
minds, might have turned into a hard, proud antagonism. But inborn
lovingness was strong enough to keep itself level with resentment.
There was hardly any creature in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) habitual world that he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was not
fond of; teasing them occasionally, of course--all except his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) uncle, or
<div class="bookquote">``Nunc,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle Nunc</b></font>)</div>as Sir Hugo had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) to say; for the baronet was the
reverse of a strait-laced man, and left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dignity to take care of
itself. Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Daniel loved in that deep-rooted filial way which makes
children always the happier for being in the same room with father or
mother, though their occupations may be quite apart. Sir Hugo's
watch-chain and seals, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) handwriting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) mode of smoking and of
talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) dogs and horses, had all a rightness and charm about
them to the boy which went along with the happiness of morning and
breakfast time. That Sir Hugo had always been a Whig, made Tories and
Radicals equally opponents of the truest and best; and the books he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had
written were all seen under the same consecration of loving belief
which differenced what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) from what was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>), in spite of
general resemblance. Those writings were various, from volumes of
travel in the brilliant style, to articles on things in general, and
pamphlets on political crises; but to Daniel they were alike in having
an unquestionable rightness by which other people's information could
be tested.

<p/>Who cannot imagine the bitterness of a first suspicion that something
in this object of complete love was _not_ quite right? Children demand
that their heroes should be fleckless, and easily believe them so:
perhaps a first discovery to the contrary is hardly a less
revolutionary shock to a passionate child than the threatened downfall
of habitual beliefs which makes the world seem to totter for us in
maturer life.

<p/>But some time after this renewal of Daniel's agitation it appeared that
Sir Hugo must have been making a merely playful experiment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
question about the singing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) sent for Daniel into the library, and
looking up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) writing as the boy entered threw himself sideways
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) armchair. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Dan!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) said kindly, drawing one of the old
embroidered stools close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come and sit down here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Daniel obeyed, and Sir Hugo put a gentle hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) shoulder, looking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) affectionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, my boy? Have you heard anything that has put you out of
spirits lately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Daniel was determined not to let the tears come, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) could not speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All changes are painful when people have been happy, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Sir Hugo, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) hand from the boy's shoulder to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) dark curls
and rubbing them gently. <div class="bookquote">``You can't be educated exactly as I wish you
to be without our parting. And I think you will find a great deal to
like at school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>This was not what Daniel expected, and was so far a relief, which gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) spirit to answer--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to go to school?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I mean you to go to Eton. I wish you to have the education of an
English gentleman; and for that it is necessary that you should go to a
public school in preparation for the university: Cambridge I mean you
to go to; it was my own university.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Daniel's color came and went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say, sirrah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to be a gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Daniel, with firm distinctness,
<div class="bookquote">``and go to school, if that is what a gentleman's son must do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Hugo watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) silently for a few moments, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) understood
now why the lad had seemed angry at the notion of becoming a singer.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) said tenderly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you won't mind about leaving your old Nunc?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Daniel, clasping Sir Hugo's caressing arm with
both his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``But shan't I come home and be with you in the
holidays?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, generally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo. <div class="bookquote">``But now I mean you to go at once
to a new tutor, to break the change for you before you go to Eton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>After this interview Daniel's spirit rose again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was meant to be a
gentleman, and in some unaccountable way it might be that his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>)
conjectures were all wrong. The very keenness of the lad taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) to
find comfort in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) ignorance. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was busying his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) mind in the
construction of possibilities, it became plain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) that there must
be possibilities of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) knew nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) left off brooding, young
joy and the spirit of adventure not being easily quenched within him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>),
and in the interval before his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) going away he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) sang about the house,
danced among the old servants, making them parting gifts, and insisted
many times to the groom on the care that was to be taken of the black
pony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I shall know much less than the other boys, Mr. Fraser?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Daniel. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) bent to think that every stranger would be
surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) ignorance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are dunces to be found everywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fraser/Fraser</b></font>)</div>said the judicious Fraser.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll not be the biggest; but you've not the makings of a Porson in
you, or a Leibnitz either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to be a Porson or a Leibnitz,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Daniel. <div class="bookquote">``I would
rather be a greater leader, like Pericles or Washington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay; you've a notion they did with little parsing, and less
algebra,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fraser/Fraser</b></font>)</div>said Fraser. But in reality he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) pupil a remarkable
lad, to whom one thing was as easy as another, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) had only a mind to
it.

<p/>Things went on very well with Daniel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) new world, except that a
boy with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was at once inclined to strike up a close friendship
talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) a great deal about his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) home and parents, and seemed to
expect a like expansiveness in return. Daniel immediately shrank into
reserve, and this experience remained a check on his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) naturally strong
bent toward the formation of intimate friendship. Every one, his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) tutor
included, set him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) down as a reserved boy, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was so good-humored
and unassuming, as well as quick, both at study and sport, that nobody
called his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) reserve disagreeable. Certainly his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) face had a great deal to
do with that favorable interpretation; but in this instance the beauty
of the closed lips told no falsehood.

<p/>A surprise that came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) before his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) first vacation strengthened the
silent consciousness of a grief within, which might be compared in some
ways with Byron's susceptibility about his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) deformed foot. Sir Hugo
wrote word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was married to Miss Raymond, a sweet lady, whom
Daniel must remember having seen. The event would make no difference
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) spending the vacation at the Abbey; he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) would find Lady
Mallinger a new friend whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would be sure to love--and much more to
the usual effect when a man, having done something agreeable to
himself, is disposed to congratulate others on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own good fortune,
and the deducible satisfactoriness of events in general.

<p/>Let Sir Hugo be partly excused until the grounds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) action can be
more fully known. The mistakes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) behavior to Deronda were due to
that dullness toward what may be going on in other minds, especially
the minds of children, which is among the commonest deficiencies, even
in good-natured men like him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>), when life has been generally easy to
themselves, and their energies have been quietly spent in feeling
gratified. No one was better aware than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) that Daniel was generally
suspected to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) own son. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was pleased with that suspicion;
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) imagination had never once been troubled with the way in which
the boy himself might be affected, either then or in the future, by the
enigmatic aspect of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) circumstances. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was as fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as could
be, and meant the best by him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). And, considering the lightness with
which the preparation of young lives seem to lie on respectable
consciences, Sir Hugo Mallinger can hardly be held open to exceptional
reproach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) had been a bachelor till he (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) was five-and-forty, had always
been regarded as a fascinating man of elegant tastes; what could be
more natural, even according to the index of language, than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>)
should have a beautiful boy like the little Deronda to take care of?
The mother might even, perhaps, be in the great world--met with in Sir
Hugo's residence abroad. The only person to feel any objection was the
boy himself, who could not have been consulted. And the boy's
objections had never been dreamed of by anybody but himself.

<p/>By the time Deronda was ready to go to Cambridge, Lady Mallinger had
already three daughters--charming babies, all three, but whose sex was
announced as a melancholy alternative, the offspring desired being a
son; if Sir Hugo had no son the succession must go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) nephew,
Mallinger Grandcourt. Daniel no longer held a wavering opinion about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) own birth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) fuller knowledge had tended to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) that Sir
Hugo was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) conceived that the baronet, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) never
approached a communication on the subject, wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) to have a tacit
understanding of the fact, and to accept in silence what would be
generally considered more than the due love and nurture. Sir Hugo's
marriage might certainly have been felt as a new ground of resentment
by some youths in Deronda's position, and the timid Lady Mallinger with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) fast-coming little ones might have been images to scowl at, as
likely to divert much that was disposable in the feelings and
possessions of the baronet from one who felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own claim to be prior.
But hatred of innocent human obstacles was a form of moral stupidity
not in Deronda's grain; even the indignation which had long mingled
itself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) affection for Sir Hugo took the quality of pain rather
than of temper; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) mind ripened to the idea of tolerance toward
error, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) habitually liked the idea with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) own silent grievances.

<p/>The sense of an entailed disadvantage--the deformed foot doubtfully
hidden by the shoe, makes a restlessly active spiritual yeast, and
easily turns a self-centered, unloving nature into an Ishmaelite. But
in the rarer sort, who presently see their own frustrated claim as one
among a myriad, the inexorable sorrow takes the form of fellowship and
makes the imagination tender. Deronda's early-weakened susceptibility,
charged at first with ready indignation and resistant pride, had raised
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) a premature reflection on certain questions of life; it had
given a bias to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) conscience, a sympathy with certain ills, and a
tension of resolve in certain directions, who marked him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) off from other
youths much more than any talents he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) possessed.

<p/>One day near the end of the long vacation, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been making a
tour in the Rhineland with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) Eton tutor, and was come for a farewell
stay at the Abbey before going to Cambridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said to Sir Hugo--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you intend me to be, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>They were in the library, and it
was the fresh morning. Sir Hugo had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) in to read a letter from
a Cambridge Don who was to be interested in him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>); and since the baronet
wore an air at once business-like and leisurely, the moment seemed
propitious for entering on a grave subject which had never yet been
thoroughly discussed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever your inclination leads you to, my boy. I thought it right to
give you the option of the army, but you shut the door on that, and I
was glad. I don't expect you to choose just yet--by-and-by, when you
have looked about you a little more and tried your mettle among older
men. The university has a good wide opening into the forum. There are
prizes to be won, and a bit of good fortune often gives the turn to a
man's taste. From what I see and hear, I should think you can take up
anything you like. You are in the deeper water with your classics than
I ever got into, and if you are rather sick of that swimming, Cambridge
is the place where you can go into mathematics with a will, and disport
yourself on the dry sand as much as you like. I floundered along like a
carp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose money will make some difference, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Daniel blushing.
<div class="bookquote">``I shall have to keep myself by-and-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly. I recommend you not to be extravagant--yes, yes, I
know--you are not inclined to that;--but you need not take up anything
against the grain. You will have a bachelor's income--enough for you to
look about with. Perhaps I had better tell you that you may consider
yourself secure of seven hundred a year. You might make yourself a
barrister--be a writer--take up politics. I confess that is what would
please me best. I should like to have you at my elbow and pulling with
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda looked embarrassed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ought to make some sign of
gratitude, but other feelings clogged his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tongue. A moment was passing
by in which a question about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) birth was throbbing within him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and
yet it seemed more impossible than ever that the question should find
vent--more impossible than ever that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could hear certain things from
Sir Hugo's lips. The liberal way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was dealt with was the
more striking because the baronet had of late cared particularly for
money, and for making the utmost of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) life-interest in the estate by
way of providing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) daughters; and as all this flashed through
Daniel's mind it was momentarily within his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) imagination that the
provision for him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) might come in some way from his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) mother. But such
vaporous conjecture passed away as quickly as it came.

<p/>Sir Hugo appeared not to notice anything peculiar in Daniel's manner,
and presently went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) usual chatty liveliness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you have done some good reading outside your classics, and
have got a grip of French and German. The truth is, unless a man can
get the prestige and income of a Don and write donnish books, it's
hardly worth while for him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) to make a Greek and Latin machine of himself
and be able to spin you out pages of the Greek dramatists at any verse
you'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) as a cue. That's all very fine, but in practical life
nobody does give you the cue for pages of Greek. In fact, it's a nicety
of conversation which I would have you attend to--much quotation of any
sort, even in English is bad. It tends to choke ordinary remark. One
couldn't carry on life comfortably without a little blindness to the
fact that everything had been said better than we can put it ourselves.
But talking of Dons, I have seen Dons make a capital figure in society;
and occasionally he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) can shoot you down a cart-load of learning in the
right place, which will tell in politics. Such men are wanted; and if
you have any turn for being a Don, I say nothing against it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think there's not much chance of that. Quicksett and Puller are both
stronger than I am. I hope you will not be much disappointed if I don't
come out with high honors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. I should like you to do yourself credit, but for God's sake
don't come out as a superior expensive kind of idiot, like young
Brecon, who got a Double First, and has been learning to knit braces
ever since. What I wish you to get is a passport in life. I don't go
against our university system: we want a little disinterested culture
to make head against cotton and capital, especially in the House. My
Greek has all evaporated; if I had to construe a verse on a sudden, I
should get an apoplectic fit. But it formed my taste. I dare say my
English is the better for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>On this point Daniel kept a respectful silence. The enthusiastic belief
in Sir Hugo's writings as a standard, and in the Whigs as the chosen
race among politicians, had gradually vanished along with the seraphic
boy's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not been the hardest of workers at Eton. Though some
kinds of study and reading came as easily as boating to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was not
of the material that usually makes the first-rate Eton scholar. There
had sprung up in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a meditative yearning after wide knowledge which
is likely always to abate ardor in the fight for prize acquirement in
narrow tracks. Happily he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was modest, and took any second-rateness in
himself simply as a fact, not as a marvel necessarily to be accounted
for by a superiority. Still Mr. Fraser's high opinion of the lad had
not been altogether belied by the youth: Daniel had the stamp of rarity
in a subdued fervor of sympathy, an activity of imagination on behalf
of others which did not show itself effusively, but was continually
seen in acts of considerateness that struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) companions as moral
eccentricity. <div class="bookquote">``Deronda would have been first-rate if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had had more
ambition,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was a frequent remark about him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>). But how could a fellow push
his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) way properly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) objected to swop for his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) own advantage,
knocked under by choice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) was within an inch of victory, and,
unlike the great Clive, would rather be the calf than the butcher? It
was a mistake, however, to suppose that Deronda had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) share of
ambition. We know he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had suffered keenly from the belief that there was
a tinge of dishonor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) lot; but there are some cases, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
one of them, in which the sense of injury breeds--not the will to
inflict injuries and climb over them as a ladder, but a hatred of all
injury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) flashes of fierceness and could hit out upon
occasion, but the occasions were not always what might have been
expected. For in what related to himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) resentful impulses had
been early checked by a mastering affectionateness. Love has a habit of
saying <div class="bookquote">``Never mind''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>to angry self, who, sitting down for the nonce in
the lower place, by-and-by gets used to it. So it was that as Deronda
approached manhood his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) feeling for Sir Hugo, while it was getting more
and more mixed with criticism, was gaining in that sort of allowance
which reconciles criticism with tenderness. The dear old beautiful home
and everything within it, Lady Mallinger and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) little ones included,
were consecrated for the youth as they had been for the boy--only with
a certain difference of light on the objects. The altarpiece was no
longer miraculously perfect, painted under infallible guidance, but the
human hand discerned in the work was appealing to a reverent tenderness
safer from the gusts of discovery. Certainly Deronda's ambition, even
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) spring-time, lay exceptionally aloof from conspicuous, vulgar
triumph, and from other ugly forms of boyish energy; perhaps because he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
was early impassioned by ideas, and burned his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) fire on those heights.
One may spend a good deal of energy in disliking and resisting what
others pursue, and a boy who is fond of somebody else's pencil-case may
not be more energetic than another who is fond of giving his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own
pencil-case away. Still it was not Deronda's disposition to escape from
ugly scenes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was more inclined to sit through them and take care of
the fellow least able to take care of himself. It had helped to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) popular that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was sometimes a little compromised by this apparent
comradeship. For a meditative interest in learning how human miseries
are wrought--as precocious in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as another sort of genius in the poet
who writes a Queen Mab at nineteen--was so infused with kindliness that
it easily passed for comradeship. Enough. In many of our neighbors'
lives there is much not only of error and lapse, but of a certain
exquisite goodness which can never be written or even spoken--only
divined by each of us, according to the inward instruction of our own
privacy.

<p/>The impression he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) made at Cambridge corresponded to his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) position at
Eton. Every one interested in him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) might have taken a
high place if his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) motives had been of a more pushing sort, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>)
had not, instead of regarding studies as instruments of success,
hampered himself with the notion that they were to feed motive and
opinion--a notion which set him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) criticising methods and arguing against
his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) freight and harness when he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) should have been using all his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) might to
pull. In the beginning his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) work at the university had a new zest for
him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>): indifferent to the continuation of Eton classical drill, he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>)
applied himself vigorously to mathematics, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) had shown an
early aptitude under Mr. Fraser, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) had the delight of feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>)
strength in a comparatively fresh exercise of thought. That delight,
and the favorable opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) tutor, determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) to try for a
mathematical scholarship in the Easter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) second year: he (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) wished to
gratify Sir Hugo by some achievement, and the study of the higher
mathematics, having the growing fascination inherent in all thinking
which demands intensity, was making him (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) a more exclusive worker than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>)
had been before.

<p/>But here came the old check which had been growing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) growth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>)
found the inward bent toward comprehension and thoroughness diverging
more and more from the track marked out by the standards of
examination: he (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) felt a heightening discontent with the wearing futility
and enfeebling strain of a demand for excessive retention and dexterity
without any insight into the principles which form the vital
connections of knowledge. -LRB-Deronda's undergraduateship occurred fifteen
years ago, when the perfection of our university methods was not yet
indisputable.-RRB- In hours when his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) dissatisfaction was strong upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
reproached himself for having been attracted by the conventional
advantage of belonging to an English university, and was tempted toward
the project of asking Sir Hugo to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) quit Cambridge and pursue a
more independent line of study abroad. The germs of this inclination
had been already stirring in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) boyish love of universal history,
which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) want to be at home in foreign countries, and follow in
imagination the traveling students of the middle ages. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) longed now to
have the sort of apprenticeship to life which would not shape him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) too
definitely, and rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) of the choice that might come from a free
growth. One sees that Deronda's demerits were likely to be on the side
of reflective hesitation, and this tendency was encouraged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
position; there was no need for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to get an immediate income, or to
fit himself in haste for a profession; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sensibility to the
half-known facts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) parentage made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) an excuse for lingering
longer than others in a state of social neutrality. Other men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
inwardly said, had a more definite place and duties. But the project
which flattered his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) inclination might not have gone beyond the stage of
ineffective brooding, if certain circumstances had not quickened it
into action.

<p/>The circumstances arose out of an enthusiastic friendship which
extended into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) after-life. Of the same year with himself, and
occupying small rooms close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), was a youth who had come as an
exhibitioner from Christ's Hospital, and had eccentricities enough for
a Charles Lamb. Only to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) pinched features and blonde hair
hanging over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) collar reminded one of pale quaint heads by early
German painters; and when this faint coloring was lit up by a joke,
there came sudden creases about the mouth and eyes which might have
been moulded by the soul of an aged humorist. His (<font color='blue'><b>humorist</b></font>) father, an engraver
of some distinction, had been dead eleven years, and his (<font color='blue'><b>humorist</b></font>) mother had
three girls to educate and maintain on a meagre annuity. Hans
Meyrick--he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had been daringly christened after Holbein--felt himself
the pillar, or rather the knotted and twisted trunk, round which these
feeble climbing plants must cling. There was no want of ability or of
honest well-meaning affection to make the prop trustworthy: the ease
and quickness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) studied might serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) to win prizes at
Cambridge, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had done among the Blue Coats, in spite of
irregularities. The only danger was, that the incalculable tendencies
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) might be fatally timed, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) good intentions might be
frustrated by some act which was not due to habit but to capricious,
scattered impulses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) could not be said to have any one bad habit; yet
at longer or shorter intervals he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had fits of impish recklessness, and
did things that would have made the worst habits.

<p/>Hans in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) right mind, however, was a lovable creature, and in Deronda
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had happened to find a friend who was likely to stand by him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) with
the more constancy, from compassion for these brief aberrations that
might bring a long repentance. Hans, indeed, shared Deronda's rooms
nearly as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) used his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) own: to Deronda he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) poured himself out on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) studies, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) affairs, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hopes; the poverty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) home, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
love for the creatures there; the itching of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) fingers to draw, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) determination to fight it away for the sake of getting some sort of
a plum that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might divide with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother and the girls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wanted no
confidence in return, but seemed to take Deronda as an Olympian who
needed nothing--an egotism in friendship which is common enough with
mercurial, expansive natures. Deronda was content, and gave Meyrick all
the interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) claimed, getting at last a brotherly anxiety about him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>),
looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) erratic moments, and contriving by adroitly
delicate devices not only to make up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) friend's lack of pence,
but to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) from threatening chances. Such friendship easily
becomes tender: the one spreads strong sheltering wings that delight in
spreading, the other gets the warm protection which is also a delight.
Meyrick was going in for a classical scholarship, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) success, in
various ways momentous, was the more probable from the steadying
influence of Deronda's friendship.

<p/>But an imprudence of Meyrick's, committed at the beginning of the
autumn term, threatened to disappoint his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hopes. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) usual
alternation between unnecessary expense and self-privation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had
given too much money for an old engraving which fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), and to
make up for it, had come from London in a third-class carriage with his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
eyes exposed to a bitter wind and any irritating particles the wind
might drive before it. The consequence was a severe inflammation of the
eyes, which for some time hung over him (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) the threat of a lasting injury.
This crushing trouble called out all Deronda's readiness to devote
himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) made every other occupation secondary to that of being
companion and eyes to Hans, working with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) and for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
classics, that if possible his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) chance of the classical scholarship
might be saved. Hans, to keep the knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) suffering from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
mother and sisters, alleged his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) work as a reason for passing the
Christmas at Cambridge, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) friend stayed up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>).

<p/>Meanwhile Deronda relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mathematics, and Hans,
reflecting on this, at length said: <div class="bookquote">``Old fellow, while you are hoisting
me you are risking yourself. With your mathematical cram one may be
like Moses or Mahomet or somebody of that sort who had to cram, and
forgot in one day what it had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) forty to learn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda would not admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) cared about the risk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had really
been beguiled into a little indifference by double sympathy: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
very anxious that Hans should not miss the much-needed scholarship, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) felt a revival of interest in the old studies. Still, when Hans,
rather late in the day, got able to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) own eyes, Deronda had
tenacity enough to try hard and recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) lost ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) failed,
however; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had the satisfaction of seeing Meyrick win.

<p/>Success, as a sort of beginning that urged completion, might have
reconciled Deronda to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) university course; but the emptiness of all
things, from politics to pastimes, is never so striking to us as when
we fail in them. The loss of the personal triumph had no severity for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), but the sense of having spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) time ineffectively in a mode of
working which had been against the grain, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) a distaste for any
renewal of the process, which turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagined project of quitting
Cambridge into a serious intention. In speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) intention to
Meyrick he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) made it appear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was glad of the turn events had
taken--glad to have the balance dip decidedly, and feel freed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
hesitations; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) must of course submit to any
strong objection on the part of Sir Hugo.

<p/>Meyrick's joy and gratitude were disturbed by much uneasiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
believed in Deronda's alleged preference, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt keenly that in
serving him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) Daniel had placed himself at a disadvantage in Sir Hugo's
opinion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) said mournfully, <div class="bookquote">``If you had got the scholarship, Sir
Hugo would have thought that you asked to leave us with a better grace.
You have spoiled your luck for my sake, and I can do nothing to amend
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you can; you are to be a first-rate fellow. I call that a
first-rate investment of my luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, confound it! You save an ugly mongrel from drowning, and expect
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to cut a fine figure. The poets have made tragedies enough about
signing one's self over to wickedness for the sake of getting something
plummy; I shall write a tragedy of a fellow who signed himself over to
be good, and was uncomfortable ever after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>But Hans lost no time in secretly writing the history of the affair to
Sir Hugo, making it plain that but for Deronda's generous devotion he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
could hardly have failed to win the prize he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been working for.

<p/>The two friends went up to town together: Meyrick to rejoice with his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
mother and the girls in their little home at Chelsea; Deronda to carry
out the less easy task of opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind to Sir Hugo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) relied a
little on the baronet's general tolerance of eccentricities, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
expected more opposition than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) met with. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was received with even
warmer kindness than usual, the failure was passed over lightly, and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) detailed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) reasons for wishing to quit the university and go
to study abroad. Sir Hugo sat for some time in a silence which was
rather meditative than surprised. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) said, looking at Daniel
with examination, <div class="bookquote">``So you don't want to be an Englishman to the
backbone after all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to be an Englishman, but I want to understand other points of
view. And I want to get rid of a merely English attitude in studies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see; you don't want to be turned out in the same mould as every
other youngster. And I have nothing to say against your doffing some of
our national prejudices. I feel the better myself for having spent a
good deal of my time abroad. But, for God's sake, keep an English cut,
and don't become indifferent to bad tobacco! And, my dear boy, it is
good to be unselfish and generous; but don't carry that too far. It
will not do to give yourself to be melted down for the benefit of the
tallow-trade; you must know where to find yourself. However, I shall
put no vote on your going. Wait until I can get off Committee, and I'll
run over with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>So Deronda went according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) will. But not before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had spent some
hours with Hans Meyrick, and been introduced to the mother and sisters
in the Chelsea home. The shy girls watched and registered every look of
their brother's friend, declared by Hans to have been the salvation of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>), a fellow like nobody else, and, in fine, a brick. They so
thoroughly accepted Deronda as an ideal, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was gone the
youngest set to work, under the criticism of the two elder girls, to
paint him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as Prince Camaralzaman.




<p/>CHAPTER XVII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is truth the poet sings,
That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--TENNYSON: _Locksley Hall_.


<p/>On a fine evening near the end of July, Deronda was rowing himself on
the Thames. It was already a year or more since he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had come back to
England, with the understanding that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) education was finished, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was somehow to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) place in English society; but though,
in deference to Sir Hugo's wish, and to fence off idleness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had
began to read law, this apparent decision had been without other result
than to deepen the roots of indecision. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) old love of boating had
revived with the more force now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was in town with the
Mallingers, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) could nowhere else get the same still seclusion
which the river gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had a boat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) own at Putney, and
whenever Sir Hugo did not want him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>), it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) chief holiday to row
till past sunset and come in again with the stars. Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was in a
sentimental stage; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was in another sort of contemplative mood
perhaps more common in the young men of our day--that of questioning
whether it were worth while to take part in the battle of the world: I
mean, of course, the young men in whom the unproductive labor of
questioning is sustained by three or five per cent, on capital which
somebody else has battled for. It puzzled Sir Hugo that one who made a
splendid contrast with all that was sickly and puling should be
hampered with ideas which, since they left an accomplished Whig like
himself unobstructed, could be no better than spectral illusions;
especially as Deronda set himself against authorship--a vocation which
is understood to turn foolish thinking into funds.

<p/>Rowing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) dark-blue shirt and skull-cap, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) curls closely clipped,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mouth beset with abundant soft waves of beard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) bore only
disguised traces of the seraphic boy <div class="bookquote">``trailing clouds of glory.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>Still,
even one who had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) since his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) boyhood might have looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with slow recognition, due perhaps to the peculiarity of the gaze
which Gwendolen chose to call <div class="bookquote">``dreadful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>though it had really a very
mild sort of scrutiny. The voice, sometimes audible in subdued snatches
of song, had turned out merely a high baritone; indeed, only to look at
his (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) lithe, powerful frame and the firm gravity of his (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) face would have
been enough for an experienced guess that he (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) had no rare and ravishing
tenor such as nature reluctantly makes at some sacrifice. Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>)
hands: they are not small and dimpled, with tapering fingers that seem
to have only a deprecating touch: they are long, flexible,
firmly-grasping hands, such as Titian has painted in a picture where he (<font color='blue'><b>Titian</b></font>)
wanted to show the combination of refinement with force. And there is
something of a likeness, too, between the faces belonging to the
hands--in both the uniform pale-brown skin, the perpendicular brow, the
calmly penetrating eyes. Not seraphic any longer: thoroughly
terrestrial and manly; but still of a kind to raise belief in a human
dignity which can afford to recognize poor relations.

<p/>Such types meet us here and there among average conditions; in a
workman, for example, whistling over a bit of measurement and lifting
his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) eyes to answer our question about the road. And often the grand
meanings of faces as well as of written words may lie chiefly in the
impressions that happen just now to be of importance in relation to
Deronda, rowing on the Thames in a very ordinary equipment for a young
Englishman at leisure, and passing under Kew Bridge with no thought of
an adventure in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) appearance was likely to play any part. In
fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) objected very strongly to the notion, which others had not
allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) to escape, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) appearance was of a kind to draw
attention; and hints of this, intended to be complimentary, found an
angry resonance in him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), coming from mingled experiences, to which a
clue has already been given. His (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) own face in the glass had during many
years associated for him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) with thoughts of some one whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) must be
like--one about whose character and lot he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) continually wondered, and
never dared to ask.

<p/>In the neighborhood of Kew Bridge, between six and seven o'clock, the
river was no solitude. Several persons were sauntering on the
towing-path, and here and there a boat was plying. Deronda had been
rowing fast to get over this spot, when, becoming aware of a great
barge advancing toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) guided his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) boat aside, and rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
oar within a couple of yards of the river-brink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was all the while
unconsciously continuing the low-toned chant which had haunted his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
throat all the way up the river--the gondolier's song in the <div class="bookquote">``Otello,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gondolier</b></font>)</div>where Rossini has worthily set to music the immortal words of Dante--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nessun maggior dolore
Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
Nella miseria'' (<font color='red'><b>Dante/DANTE</b></font>)</div>:
-LSB-Footnote: Dante's words are best rendered by our own poet in the lines
at the head of the chapter.-RSB-

<p/>and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) oar, the pianissimo fall of the melodic wail
<div class="bookquote">``nella miseria''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was distinctly audible on the brink of the water. Three
or four persons had paused at various spots to watch the barge passing
the bridge, and doubtless included in their notice the young gentleman
in the boat; but probably it was only to one ear that the low vocal
sounds came with more significance than if they had been an
insect-murmur amidst the sum of current noises. Deronda, awaiting the
barge, now turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) head to the river-side, and saw at a few yards'
distant from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) a figure which might have been an impersonation of the
misery he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was unconsciously giving voice to: a girl hardly more than
eighteen, of low slim figure, with most delicate little face, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dark
curls pushed behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ears under a large black hat, a long woolen
cloak over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulders. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands were hanging down clasped before
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes were fixed on the river with a look of immovable,
statue-like despair. This strong arrest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) attention made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) cease
singing: apparently his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) voice had entered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) inner world without her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
taking any note of whence it came, for when it suddenly ceased she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
changed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attitude slightly, and, looking round with a frightened
glance, met Deronda's face. It was but a couple of moments, but that
seemed a long while for two people to look straight at each other. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
look was something like that of a fawn or other gentle animal before it
turns to run away: no blush, no special alarm, but only some timidity
which yet could not hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from a long look before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned. In
fact, it seemed to Deronda that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was only half conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
surroundings: was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hungry, or was there some other cause of
bewilderment? He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt an outleap of interest and compassion toward her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>);
but the next instant she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had turned and walked away to a neighboring
bench under a tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had no right to linger and watch her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>):
poorly-dressed, melancholy women are common sights; it was only the
delicate beauty, picturesque lines and color of the image that was
exceptional, and these conditions made it more markedly impossible that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should obtrude his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) interest upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) began to row away and was
soon far up the river; but no other thoughts were busy enough quite to
expel that pale image of unhappy girlhood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) fell again and again to
speculating on the probable romance that lay behind that loneliness and
look of desolation; then to smile at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own share in the prejudice
that interesting faces must have interesting adventures; then to
justify himself for feeling that sorrow was the more tragic when it
befell delicate, childlike beauty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have forgotten the look of misery if she (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) had been ugly
and vulgar,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said to himself. But there was no denying that the
attractiveness of the image made it likelier to last. It was clear to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as an onyx cameo; the brown-black drapery, the white face with
small, small features and dark, long-lashed eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind glanced over
the girl-tragedies that are going on in the world, hidden, unheeded, as
if they were but tragedies of the copse or hedgerow, where the helpless
drag wounded wings forsakenly, and streak the shadowed moss with the
red moment-hand of their own death. Deronda of late, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) solitary
excursions, had been occupied chiefly with uncertainties about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own
course; but those uncertainties, being much at their leisure, were wont
to have such wide-sweeping connections with all life and history that
the new image of helpless sorrow easily blent itself with what seemed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) the strong array of reasons why he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should shrink from getting
into that routine of the world which makes men apologize for all its
wrong-doing, and take opinions as mere professional equipment--why he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
should not draw strongly at any thread in the hopelessly-entangled
scheme of things.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) used his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) oars little, satisfied to go with the tide and be taken
back by it. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) habit to indulge himself in that solemn
passivity which easily comes with the lengthening shadows and mellow
light, when thinking and desiring melt together imperceptibly, and what
in other hours may have seemed argument takes the quality of passionate
vision. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had come back again with the tide past Richmond
Bridge the sun was near setting: and the approach of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) favorite
hour--with its deepening stillness and darkening masses of tree and
building between the double glow of the sky and the river--disposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
to linger as if they had been an unfinished strain of music. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked
out for a perfectly solitary spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could lodge his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) boat against
the bank, and, throwing himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) head propped on
the cushions, could watch out the light of sunset and the opening of
that bead-roll which some oriental poet describes as God's call to the
little stars, who each answer, <div class="bookquote">``Here am I.''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) chose a spot in the bend
of the river just opposite Kew Gardens, where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had a great breadth of
water before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) reflecting the glory of the sky, while he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) himself was
in shadow. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lay with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head, propped on a level
with the boat's edge, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could see all round him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but could not
be seen by any one at a few yards' distance; and for a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
never turned his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes from the view right in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was
forgetting everything else in a half-speculative, half-involuntary
identification of himself with the objects he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was looking at, thinking
how far it might be possible habitually to shift his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) centre till his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
own personality would be no less outside him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) than the landscape--when
the sense of something moving on the bank opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) where it was
bordered by a line of willow bushes, made him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) turn his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) glance
thitherward. In the first moment he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had a darting presentiment about
the moving figure; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could see the small face with the strange
dying sunlight upon it. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feared to frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) by a sudden movement,
and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with motionless attention. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looked round, but seemed
only to gather security from the apparent solitude, hid her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hat among
the willows, and immediately took off her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) woolen cloak. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
seated herself and deliberately dipped the cloak in the water, holding
it there a little while, then taking it out with effort, rising from
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seat as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did so. By this time Deronda felt sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) meant
to wrap the wet cloak round her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) as a drowning shroud; there was no
longer time to hesitate about frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rose and seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
oar to ply across; happily her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) position lay a little below him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). The
poor thing, overcome with terror at this sign of discovery from the
opposite bank, sank down on the brink again, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cloak half out
of the water. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) crouched and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) face as if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) kept a faint
hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had not been seen, and that the boatman was accidentally
coming toward her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). But soon he (<font color='blue'><b>boatman</b></font>) was within brief space of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), steadying
his (<font color='blue'><b>boatman</b></font>) boat against the bank, and speaking, but very gently--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid. You are unhappy. Pray, trust me. Tell me what I can
do to help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head and looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>boatman</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>boatman</b></font>) face now was toward the
light, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knew it again. But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did not speak for a few moments
which were a renewal of their former gaze at each other. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
said in a low sweet voice, with an accent so distinct that it suggested
foreignness and yet was not foreign, <div class="bookquote">``I saw you before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and then added
dreamily, after a like pause, <div class="bookquote">``nella miseria.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda, not understanding the connection of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thoughts, supposed
that her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mind was weakened by distress and hunger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was you, singing?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went on, hesitatingly--<div class="bookquote">``Nessun maggior
dolore.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The mere words themselves uttered in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sweet undertones
seemed to give the melody to Deronda's ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, understanding now, <div class="bookquote">``I am often singing them. But I
fear you will injure yourself staying here. Pray let me take you in my
boat to some place of safety. And that wet cloak--let me take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would not attempt to take it without her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) leave, dreading lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
should scare her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). Even at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shrank and
clutched the cloak more tenaciously. But her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
with a question in them as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You look good. Perhaps it is
God's command.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do trust me. Let me help you. I will die before I will let any harm
come to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sitting posture, first dragging the saturated cloak
and then letting it fall on the ground--it was too heavy for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tired
arms. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) little woman's figure as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) delicate chilled hands
together one over the other against her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) waist, and went a step backward
while she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head forward as if not to lose sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face,
was unspeakably touching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>the words escaped Deronda in a tone so low and solemn that
they seemed like a prayer become unconsciously vocal. The agitating
impression this forsaken girl was making on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) stirred a fibre that
lay close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) deepest interest in the fates of women--<div class="bookquote">``perhaps my
mother was like this one.''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>The old thought had come now with a new
impetus of mingled feeling, and urged that exclamation in which both
East and West have for ages concentrated their awe in the presence of
inexorable calamity.

<p/>The low-toned words seemed to have some reassurance in them for the
hearer: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stepped forward close to the boat's side, and Deronda put
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand, hoping now that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
already put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tiny hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) which closed around it, when some
new thought struck her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and drawing back she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nowhere to go--nobody belonging to me in all this land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will take you to a lady who has daughters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
immediately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt a sort of relief in gathering that the wretched
home and cruel friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be fleeing from were not in
the near background. Still she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hesitated, and said more timidly than
ever--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you belong to the theatre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I have nothing to do with the theatre,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, in a decided
tone. Then beseechingly, <div class="bookquote">``I will put you in perfect safety at once;
with a lady, a good woman; I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will be kind. Let us lose no
time: you will make yourself ill. Life may still become sweet to you.
There are good people--there are good women who will take care of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drew backward no more, but stepped in easily, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were used
to such action, and sat down on the cushions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had a covering for your head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My hat?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``It is quite hidden in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will find it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand deprecatingly as
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attempted to rise. <div class="bookquote">``The boat is fixed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) jumped out, found the hat, and lifted up the saturated cloak,
wringing it and throwing it into the bottom of the boat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must carry the cloak away, to prevent any one who may have noticed
you from thinking you have been drowned,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, cheerfully, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
got in again and presented the old hat to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had any other
garment than my coat to offer you. But shall you mind throwing it over
your shoulders while we are on the water? It is quite an ordinary thing
to do, when people return late and are not enough provided with wraps.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) held out the coat toward her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with a smile, and there came a faint
melancholy smile in answer, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took it and put it on very cleverly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have some biscuits--should you like them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I cannot eat. I had still some money left to buy bread.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) began to ply his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) oar without further remark, and they went along
swiftly for many minutes without speaking. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), but
was watching the oar, leaning forward in an attitude of repose, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were beginning to feel the comfort of returning warmth and the
prospect of life instead of death. The twilight was deepening; the red
flush was all gone and the little stars were giving their answer one
after another. The moon was rising, but was still entangled among the
trees and buildings. The light was not such that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could distinctly
discern the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) features or her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) glance, but they were
distinctly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) nevertheless--features and a glance which seemed
to have given a fuller meaning for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to the human face. Among his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
anxieties one was dominant: his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) first impression about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
mind might be disordered, had not been quite dissipated: the project of
suicide was unmistakable, and given a deeper color to every other
suspicious sign. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) longed to begin a conversation, but abstained,
wishing to encourage the confidence that might induce her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to speak
first. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to listen to the oar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had not come, I should have been dead now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot bear you to speak of that. I hope you will never be sorry
that I came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot see how I shall be glad to live. The _maggior dolore_ and the
_miseria_ have lasted longer than the _tempo felice_.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) paused and
then went on dreamily,--<div class="bookquote">''_Dolore--miseria_--I think those words are
alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda was mute: to question her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed an unwarrantable freedom; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
shrank from appearing to claim the authority of a benefactor, or to
treat her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with the less reverence because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was in distress. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went
on musingly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it was not wicked. Death and life are one before the
Eternal. I know our fathers slew their children and then slew
themselves, to keep their souls pure. I meant it so. But now I am
commanded to live. I cannot see how I shall live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will find friends. I will find them for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head and said mournfully, <div class="bookquote">``Not my mother and brother. I
cannot find them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are English? You must be--speaking English so perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not answer immediately, but looked at Deronda again, straining
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in the double light. Until now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been watching the
oar. It seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were half roused, and wondered which part of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) impression was dreaming and which waking. Sorrowful isolation had
benumbed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sense of reality, and the power of distinguishing outward
and inward was continually slipping away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) look was full of
wondering timidity such as the forsaken one in the desert might have
lifted to the angelic vision before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) message was in
anger or in pity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to know if I am English?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said at last, while Deronda was
reddening nervously under a gaze which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt more fully than he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to know nothing except what you like to tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said,
still uneasy in the fear that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind was wandering. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it is
not good for you to talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will tell you. I am English-born. But I am a Jewess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda was silent, inwardly wondering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not said this to
himself before, though any one who had seen delicate-faced Spanish
girls might simply have guessed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be Spanish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you despise me for it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said presently in low tones, which had
a sadness that pierced like a cry from a small dumb creature in fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``I am not so foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know many Jews are bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So are many Christians. But I should not think it fair for you to
despise me because of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother and brother were good. But I shall never find them. I am
come a long way--from abroad. I ran away; but I cannot tell you--I
cannot speak of it. I thought I might find my mother again--God would
guide me. But then I despaired. This morning when the light came, I
felt as if one word kept sounding within me--Never! never! But now--I
begin--to think--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) words were broken by rising sobs--<div class="bookquote">``I am
commanded to live--perhaps we are going to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With an outburst of weeping she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) buried her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hoped
that this passionate weeping might relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) excitement. Meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
was inwardly picturing in much embarrassment how he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should present
himself with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in Park Lane--the course which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had at first
unreflectingly determined on. No one kinder and more gentle than Lady
Mallinger; but it was hardly probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) would be at home; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
had a shuddering sense of a lackey staring at this delicate, sorrowful
image of womanhood--of glaring lights and fine staircases, and perhaps
chilling suspicious manners from lady's maid and housekeeper, that
might scare the mind already in a state of dangerous susceptibility.
But to take her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) to any other shelter than a home already known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
was not to be contemplated: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was full of fears about the issue of the
adventure which had brought on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) a responsibility all the heavier for
the strong and agitating impression this childlike creature had made on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). But another resource came to mind: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could venture to take her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) to
Mrs. Meyrick's--to the small house at Chelsea--where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been often
enough since his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) return from abroad to feel sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could appeal
there to generous hearts, which had a romantic readiness to believe in
innocent need and to help it. Hans Meyrick was safe away in Italy, and
Deronda felt the comfort of presenting himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) charge at a
house where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would be met by a motherly figure of quakerish neatness,
and three girls who hardly knew of any evil closer to them than what
lay in history-books, and dramas, and would at once associate a lovely
Jewess with Rebecca in <div class="bookquote">``Ivanhoe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rebecca</b></font>)</div>besides thinking that everything they
did at Deronda's request would be done for their idol, Hans. The vision
of the Chelsea home once raised, Deronda no longer hesitated.

<p/>The rumbling thither in the cab after the stillness of the water seemed
long. Happily his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) charge had been quiet since her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) fit of weeping, and
submitted like a tired child. When they were in the cab, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) laid down
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) hat and tried to rest her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) head, but the jolting movement would not
let it rest. Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) dozed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) sweet head hung helpless, first
on one side, then on the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are too good to have any fear about taking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>thought
Deronda. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) person, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) exquisite utterance, were one
strong appeal to belief and tenderness. Yet what had been the history
which had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) to this desolation? He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was going on a strange
errand--to ask shelter for this waif. Then there occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) the
beautiful story Plutarch somewhere tells of the Delphic women: how when
the Maenads, outworn with their torch-lit wanderings, lay down to sleep
in the market-place, the matrons came and stood silently round them to
keep guard over their slumbers; then, when they waked, ministered to
them tenderly and saw them safely to their own borders. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) could trust
the women he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was going to for having hearts as good.

<p/>Deronda felt himself growing older this evening and entering on a new
phase in finding a life to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own had come--perhaps as a rescue;
but how to make sure that snatching from death was rescue? The moment
of finding a fellow-creature is often as full of mingled doubt and
exultation as the moment of finding an idea.




<p/>CHAPTER XVIII.

<p/>Life is a various mother: now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dons
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) plumes and brilliants, climbs the marble stairs
With head aloft, nor ever turns her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes
On lackeys who attend her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dwells
Grim-clad, up darksome allyes, breathes hot gin,
And screams in pauper riot.

<p/>But to these
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came a frugal matron, neat and deft,
With cheerful morning thoughts and quick device
To find the much in little.


<p/>Mrs. Meyrick's house was not noisy: the front parlor looked on the
river, and the back on gardens, so that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was reading aloud to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) daughters, the window could be left open to freshen the air of the
small double room where a lamp and two candles were burning. The
candles were on a table apart for Kate, who was drawing illustrations
for a publisher; the lamp was not only for the reader but for Amy and
Mab, who were embroidering satin cushions for <div class="bookquote">``the great world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div><p/>Outside, the house looked very narrow and shabby, the bright light
through the holland blind showing the heavy old-fashioned window-frame;
but it is pleasant to know that many such grim-walled slices of space
in our foggy London have been and still are the homes of a culture the
more spotlessly free from vulgarity, because poverty has rendered
everything like display an impersonal question, and all the grand shows
of the world simply a spectacle which rouses petty rivalry or vain
effort after possession.

<p/>The Meyricks' was a home of that kind: and they all clung to this
particular house in a row because its interior was filled with objects
always in the same places, which, for the mother held memories of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
marriage time, and for the young ones seemed as necessary and
uncriticised a part of their world as the stars of the Great Bear seen
from the back windows. Mrs. Meyrick had borne much stint of other
matters that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) might be able to keep some engravings specially
cherished by her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) husband; and the narrow spaces of wall held a world
history in scenes and heads which the children had early learned by
heart. The chairs and tables were also old friends preferred to new.
But in these two little parlors with no furniture that a broker would
have cared to cheapen except the prints and piano, there was space and
apparatus for a wide-glancing, nicely-select life, opened to the
highest things in music, painting and poetry. I am not sure that in the
times of greatest scarcity, before Kate could get paid-work, these
ladies had always had a servant to light their fires and sweep their
rooms; yet they were fastidious in some points, and could not believe
that the manners of ladies in the fashionable world were so full of
coarse selfishness, petty quarreling, and slang as they are represented
to be in what are called literary photographs. The Meyricks had their
little oddities, streaks of eccentricity from the mother's blood as
well as the father's, their minds being like mediæval houses with
unexpected recesses and openings from this into that, flights of steps
and sudden outlooks.

<p/>But mother and daughters were all united by a triple bond--family love;
admiration for the finest work, the best action; and habitual industry.
Hans' desire to spend some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) money in making their lives more
luxurious had been resisted by all of them, and both they and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had
been thus saved from regrets at the threatened triumphs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) yearning
for art over the attractions of secured income--a triumph that would
by-and-by oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) fellowship. They could all afford
to laugh at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) Gavarni-caricatures and to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) blameless in
following a natural bent which their unselfishness and independence had
left without obstacle. It was enough for them to go on in their old
way, only having a grand treat of opera-going -LRB-to the gallery-RRB- when
Hans came home on a visit.

<p/>Seeing the group they made this evening, one could hardly wish them to
change their way of life. They were all alike small, and so in due
proportion to their miniature rooms. Mrs. Meyrick was reading aloud
from a French book; she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was a lively little woman, half French, half
Scotch, with a pretty articulateness of speech that seemed to make
daylight in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hearer's understanding. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was not yet fifty,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) rippling hair, covered by a quakerish net cap, was chiefly gray,
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) eyebrows were brown as the bright eyes below them; her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) black
dress, almost like a priest's cassock with its rows of buttons, suited
a neat figure hardly five feet high. The daughters were to match the
mother, except that Mab had Hans' light hair and complexion, with a
bossy, irregular brow, and other quaintnesses that reminded one of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>).
Everything about them was compact, from the firm coils of their hair,
fastened back _à la Chinoise_, to their gray skirts in Puritan
nonconformity with the fashion, which at that time would have demanded
that four feminine circumferences should fill all the free space in the
front parlor. All four, if they had been wax-work, might have been
packed easily in a fashionable lady's traveling trunk. Their faces
seemed full of speech, as if their minds had been shelled, after the
manner of horse-chestnuts, and become brightly visible. The only large
thing of its kind in the room was Hafiz, the Persian cat, comfortably
poised on the brown leather back of a chair, and opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Hafiz</b></font>) large eyes
now and then to see that the lower animals were not in any mischief.

<p/>The book Mrs. Meyrick had before her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was Erckmann-Chatrian's _Historie
d'un Conscrit_. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had just finished reading it aloud, and Mab, who
had let her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) work fall on the ground while she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) stretched her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) head
forward and fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) eyes on the reader, exclaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that is the finest story in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, Mab!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy, <div class="bookquote">``it is the last you have heard. Everything
that pleases you is the best in its turn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hardly to be called a story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``It is a bit of history
brought near us with a strong telescope. We can see the soldiers'
faces: no, it is more than that--we can hear everything--we can almost
hear their hearts beat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care what you call it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, flirting away her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thimble.
<div class="bookquote">``Call it a chapter in Revelations. It makes me want to do something
good, something grand. It makes me so sorry for everybody. It makes me
like Schiller--I want to take the world in my arms and kiss it. I must
kiss you instead, little mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mother's
neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever you are in that mood, Mab, down goes your work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy.
<div class="bookquote">``It would be doing something good to finish your cushion without
soiling it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--oh--oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>groaned Mab, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stooped to pick up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) work and
thimble. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had three wounded conscripts to take care of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would spill their beef-tea while you were talking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mab! don't be hard on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother. <div class="bookquote">``Give me the
embroidery now, child. You go on with your enthusiasm, and I will go on
with the pink and white poppy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, ma, I think you are more caustic than Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) head back to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) drawing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--oh--oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>cried Mab again, rising and stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">``I wish
something wonderful would happen. I feel like the deluge. The waters of
the great deep are broken up, and the windows of heaven are opened. I
must sit down and play the scales.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div><p/>Mab was opening the piano while the others were laughing at this
climax, when a cab stopped before the house, and there forthwith came a
quick rap of the knocker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, starting up, <div class="bookquote">``it is after ten, and Phoebe
is gone to bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hastened out, leaving the parlor door open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Deronda!''  (<font color='red'><b>The girls</b></font>)</div>The girls could hear this exclamation from their mamma.
Mab clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hands, saying in a loud whisper, <div class="bookquote">``There now! something
_is_ going to happen.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>Kate and Amy gave up their work in amazement.
But Deronda's tone in reply was so low that they could not hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
words, and Mrs. Meyrick immediately closed the parlor door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I am trusting to your goodness in a most extraordinary way,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda went on, after giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) brief narrative; <div class="bookquote">``but you can imagine
how helpless I feel with a young creature like this on my hands. I
could not go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) among strangers, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) nervous state I
should dread taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) into a house full of servants. I have trusted
to your mercy. I hope you will not think my act unwarrantable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary. You have honored me by trusting me. I see your
difficulty. Pray bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) in. I will go and prepare the girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>While Deronda went back to the cab, Mrs. Meyrick turned into the parlor
again and said: <div class="bookquote">``Here is somebody to take care of instead of your
wounded conscripts, Mab: a poor girl who was going to drown herself in
despair. Mr. Deronda found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only just in time to save her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) along in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) boat, and did not know what else it would be
safe to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), so he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) has trusted us and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here. It
seems she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is a Jewess, but quite refined, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) says--knowing Italian and
music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>The three girls, wondering and expectant, came forward and stood near
each other in mute confidence that they were all feeling alike under
this appeal to their compassion. Mab looked rather awe-stricken, as if
this answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) wish were something preternatural.

<p/>Meanwhile Deronda going to the door of the cab where the pale face was
now gazing out with roused observation, said, <div class="bookquote">``I have brought you to
some of the kindest people in the world: there are daughters like you.
It is a happy home. Will you let me take you to them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) stepped out obediently, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
hat; and when Deronda led her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) into the full light of the parlor where
the four little women stood awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) made a picture that would
have stirred much duller sensibilities than theirs. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was a
little dazed by the sudden light, and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had concentrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
glance he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hand into the mother's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was inwardly rejoicing
that the Meyricks were so small: the dark-curled head was the highest
among them. The poor wanderer could not be afraid of these gentle faces
so near hers: and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was looking at each of them in turn while the
mother said, <div class="bookquote">``You must be weary, poor child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will take care of you--we will comfort you--we will love you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>cried Mab, no longer able to restrain herself, and taking the small
right hand caressingly between both her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own. This gentle welcoming
warmth was penetrating the bewildered one: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hung back just enough to
see better the four faces in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), whose good will was being
reflected in hers, not in any smile, but in that undefinable change
which tells us that anxiety is passing in contentment. For an instant
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked up at Deronda, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were referring all this mercy to
him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>), and then again turning to Mrs. Meyrick, said with more
collectedness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) sweet tones than he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had heard before--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a stranger. I am a Jewess. You might have thought I was wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we are sure you are good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>burst out Mab.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We think no evil of you, poor child. You shall be safe with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Meyrick. <div class="bookquote">``Come now and sit down. You must have some food, and then
you must go to rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>The stranger looked up again at Deronda, who said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will have no more fears with these friends? You will rest
to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I should not fear. I should rest. I think these are the
ministering angels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Meyrick wanted to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) to seat, but again hanging back gently,
the poor weary thing spoke as if with a scruple at being received
without a further account of herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Mirah Lapidoth. I am come a long way, all the way from
Prague by myself. I made my escape. I ran away from dreadful things. I
came to find my mother and brother in London. I had been taken from my
mother when I was little, but I thought I could find her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again. I had
trouble--the houses were all gone--I could not find her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). It has been a
long while, and I had not much money. That is why I am in distress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our mother will be good to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>cried Mab. <div class="bookquote">``See what a nice little
mother she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do sit down now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, moving a chair forward, while Amy ran to
get some tea.

<p/>Mirah resisted no longer, but seated herself with perfect grace,
crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little feet, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands one over the other on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
lap, and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) friends with placid reverence; whereupon Hafiz,
who had been watching the scene restlessly came forward with tail erect
and rubbed himself against her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ankles. Deronda felt it time to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you allow me to come again and inquire--perhaps at five
to-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said to Mrs. Meyrick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, pray; we shall have had time to make acquaintance then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, looking down at Mirah, and putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) took it, and the moment brought back to them both
strongly the other moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had first taken that outstretched
hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and said with reverential fervor, <div class="bookquote">``The
God of our fathers bless you and deliver you from all evil as you have
delivered me. I did not believe there was any man so good. None before
have thought me worthy of the best. You found me poor and miserable,
yet you have given me the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda could not speak, but with silent adieux to the Meyricks,
hurried away.




<p/>BOOK III--MAIDENS CHOOSING.


<p/>CHAPTER XIX.

<p/>``I pity the man who can travel from Dan to Beersheba, and say, <div class="bookquote">``Tis
all barren': and so it is: and so is all the world to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) who will not
cultivate the fruits it offers.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--STERNE: _Sentimental Journey_.


<p/>To say that Deronda was romantic would be to misrepresent him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>); but
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) calm and somewhat self-repressed exterior there was a fervor
which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) easily find poetry and romance among the events of
every-day life. And perhaps poetry and romance are as plentiful as ever
in the world except for those phlegmatic natures who I suspect would in
any age have regarded them as a dull form of erroneous thinking. They
exist very easily in the same room with the microscope and even in
railway carriages: what banishes them in the vacuum in gentlemen and
lady passengers. How should all the apparatus of heaven and earth, from
the farthest firmament to the tender bosom of the mother who nourished
us, make poetry for a mind that had no movements of awe and tenderness,
no sense of fellowship which thrills from the near to the distant, and
back again from the distant to the near?

<p/>To Deronda this event of finding Mirah was as heart-stirring as
anything that befell Orestes or Rinaldo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sat up half the night,
living again through the moments since he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had first discerned Mirah on
the river-brink, with the fresh and fresh vividness which belongs to
emotive memory. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) took up a book to try and dull this urgency of
inward vision, the printed words were no more than a network through
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw and heard everything as clearly as before--saw not only
the actual events of two hours, but possibilities of what had been and
what might be which those events were enough to feed with the warm
blood of passionate hope and fear. Something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own experience
caused Mirah's search after her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) mother to lay hold with peculiar force
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagination. The first prompting of sympathy was to aid her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) search: if given persons were extant in London there were ways of
finding them, as subtle as scientific experiment, the right machinery
being set at work. But here the mixed feelings which belonged to
Deronda's kindred experience naturally transfused themselves into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
anxiety on behalf of Mirah.

<p/>The desire to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own mother, or to know about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), was constantly
haunted with dread; and in imagining what might befall Mirah it quickly
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) that finding the mother and brother from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
been parted when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a little one might turn out to be a calamity.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in the boat she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother and brother were
good; but the goodness might have been chiefly in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own ignorant
innocence and yearning memory, and the ten or twelve years since the
parting had been time enough for much worsening. Spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) strong
tendency to side with the objects of prejudice, and in general with
those who got the worst of it, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) interest had never been practically
drawn toward existing Jews, and the facts he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew about them, whether
they walked conspicuous in fine apparel or lurked in by-streets, were
chiefly of a sort most repugnant to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Of learned and accomplished
Jews he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took it for granted that they had dropped their religion, and
wished to be merged in the people of their native lands. Scorn flung at
a Jew as such would have roused all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) sympathy in griefs of
inheritance; but the indiscriminate scorn of a race will often strike a
specimen who has well earned it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) own account, and might fairly be
gibbeted as a rascally son of Adam. It appears that the Caribs, who
know little of theology, regard thieving as a practice peculiarly
connected with Christian tenets, and probably they could allege
experimental grounds for this opinion. Deronda could not escape -LRB-who
can?-RRB- knowing ugly stories of Jewish characteristics and occupations;
and though one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) favorite protests was against the severance of
past and present history, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was like others who shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) protest, in
never having cared to reach any more special conclusions about actual
Jews than that they retained the virtues and vices of a long-oppressed
race. But now that Mirah's longing roused his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind to a closer survey
of details, very disagreeable images urged themselves of what it might
be to find out this middle-aged Jewess and her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) son. To be sure, there
was the exquisite refinement and charm of the creature herself to make
a presumption in favor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) immediate kindred, but--he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) must wait to
know more: perhaps through Mrs. Meyrick he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might gather some guiding
hints from Mirah's own lips. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) accent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) looks--all the
sweet purity that clothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) as with a consecrating garment made him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
shrink the more from giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), either ideally or practically, an
association with what was hateful or contaminating. But these fine
words with which we fumigate and becloud unpleasant facts are not the
language in which we think. Deronda's thinking went on in rapid images
of what might be: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw himself guided by some official scout into a
dingy street; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) entered through a dim doorway, and saw a hawk-eyed
woman, rough-headed, and unwashed, cheapening a hungry girl's last bit
of finery; or in some quarter only the more hideous for being smarter,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) found himself under the breath of a young Jew talkative and
familiar, willing to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) acquaintance with gentlemen's tastes, and
not fastidious in any transactions with which they would favor him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)--and
so on through the brief chapter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) experience in this kind. Excuse
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>): his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind was not apt to run spontaneously into insulting ideas, or
to practice a form of wit which identifies Moses with the advertisement
sheet; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was just now governed by dread, and if Mirah's parents
had been Christian, the chief difference would have been that his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
forebodings would have been fed with wider knowledge. It was the habit
of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) mind to connect dread with unknown parentage, and in this case
as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) own there was enough to make the connection reasonable.

<p/>But what was to be done with Mirah? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) needed shelter and protection
in the fullest sense, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) chivalrous sentiment roused itself to
insist that the sooner and the more fully he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) could engage for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) the
interest of others besides himself, the better he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) should fulfill her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>)
claims on him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had no right to provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) entirely, though he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
might be able to do so; the very depth of the impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) had
produced made him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) desire that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) should understand herself to be
entirely independent of him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>); and vague visions of the future which he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
tried to dispel as fantastic left their influence in an anxiety
stronger than any motive he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) could give for it, that those who saw his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
actions closely should be acquainted from the first with the history of
his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) relation to Mirah. He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had learned to hate secrecy about the grand
ties and obligations of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) life--to hate it the more because a strong
spell of interwoven sensibilities hindered him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) from breaking such
secrecy. Deronda had made a vow to himself that--since the truths which
disgrace mortals are not all of their own making--the truth should
never be made a disgrace to another by his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) act. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not without
terror lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should break this vow, and fall into the apologetic
philosophy which explains the world into containing nothing better than
one's own conduct.

<p/>At one moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) resolved to tell the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) adventure to Sir
Hugo and Lady Mallinger the next morning at breakfast, but the
possibility that something quite new might reveal itself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) next
visit to Mrs. Meyrick's checked this impulse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) finally went to
sleep on the conclusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would wait until that visit had been
made.




<p/>CHAPTER XX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will hardly be denied that even in this frail and corrupted world,
we sometimes meet persons who, in their very mien and aspect, as well
as in the whole habit of life, manifest such a signature and stamp of
virtue, as to make our judgment of them a matter of intuition rather
than the result of continued examination.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--ALEXANDER KNOX: quoted in
Southey's Life of Wesley.


<p/>Mirah said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had slept well that night; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) came down
in Mab's black dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) dark hair curling in fresh fibrils as it
gradually dried from its plenteous bath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) looked like one who was
beginning to take comfort after the long sorrow and watching which had
paled her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) cheek and made blue semicircles under her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) eyes. It was Mab
who carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) breakfast and ushered her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) down--with some pride in the
effect produced by a pair of tiny felt slippers which she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had rushed
out to buy because there were no shoes in the house small enough for
Mirah, whose borrowed dress ceased about her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) ankles and displayed the
cheap clothing that, moulding itself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) feet, seemed an adornment
as choice as the sheaths of buds. The farthing buckles were bijoux.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you please, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>cried Mab, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hands and stooping
toward Mirah's feet, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) entered the parlor; <div class="bookquote">``look at the slippers,
how beautiful they fit! I declare she (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) is like the Queen Budoor--' two
delicate feet, the work of the protecting and all-recompensing Creator,
support her (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>); and I wonder how they can sustain what is above them.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) own feet in a childlike way and then smiled at
Mrs. Meyrick, who was saying inwardly, <div class="bookquote">``One could hardly imagine this
creature having an evil thought. But wise people would tell me to be
cautious.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) returned Mirah's smile and said, <div class="bookquote">``I fear the feet have
had to sustain their burden a little too often lately. But to-day she (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>)
will rest and be my companion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) will tell you so many things and I shall not hear them,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>grumbled Mab, who felt herself in the first volume of a delightful
romance and obliged to miss some chapters because she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had to go to
pupils.

<p/>Kate was already gone to make sketches along the river, and Amy was
away on business errands. It was what the mother wished, to be alone
with this stranger, whose story must be a sorrowful one, yet was
needful to be told.

<p/>The small front parlor was as good as a temple that morning. The
sunlight was on the river and soft air came in through the open window;
the walls showed a glorious silent cloud of witnesses--the Virgin
soaring amid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cherubic escort; grand Melancholia with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) solemn
universe; the Prophets and Sibyls; the School of Athens; the Last
Supper; mystic groups where far-off ages made one moment; grave Holbein
and Rembrandt heads; the Tragic Muse; last-century children at their
musings or their play; Italian poets--all were there through the medium
of a little black and white. The neat mother who had weathered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
troubles, and come out of them with a face still cheerful, was sorting
colored wools for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) embroidery. Hafiz purred on the window-ledge, the
clock on the mantle-piece ticked without hurry, and the occasional
sound of wheels seemed to lie outside the more massive central quiet.
Mrs. Meyrick thought that this quiet might be the best invitation to
speech on the part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) companion, and chose not to disturb it by
remark. Mirah sat opposite in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) former attitude, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hands clasped on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) lap, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) ankles crossed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) eyes at first traveling slowly over
the objects around her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), but finally resting with a sort of placid
reverence on Mrs. Meyrick. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) began to speak softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember my mother's face better than anything; yet I was not seven
when I was taken away, and I am nineteen now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can understand that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick. <div class="bookquote">``There are some earliest
things that last the longest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, it was the earliest. I think my life began with waking up and
loving my mother's face: it was so near to me, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms were round
me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sang to me. One hymn she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sang so often, so often: and then
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) taught me to sing it with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>): it was the first I ever sang. They
were always Hebrew hymns she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sang; and because I never knew the meaning
of the words they seemed full of nothing but our love and happiness.
When I lay in my little bed and it was all white above me, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to
bend over me, between me and the white, and sing in a sweet, low voice.
I can dream myself back into that time when I am awake, and it often
comes back to me in my sleep--my hand is very little, I put it up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kisses it. Sometimes in my dreams I begin to tremble
and think that we are both dead; but then I wake up and my hand lies
like this, and for a moment I hardly know myself. But if I could see my
mother again I should know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must expect some change after twelve years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick,
gently. <div class="bookquote">``See my grey hair: ten years ago it was bright brown. The days
and months pace over us like restless little birds, and leave the marks
of their feet backward and forward; especially when they are like birds
with heavy hearts-then they tread heavily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I am sure her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart has been heavy for want of me. But to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
joy if we could meet again, and I could make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) know I love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and
give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) deep comfort after all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mourning! If that could be, I
should mind nothing; I should be glad that I have lived through my
trouble. I did despair. The world seemed miserable and wicked; none
helped me so that I could bear their looks and words; I felt that my
mother was dead, and death was the only way to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). But then in the
last moment--yesterday, when I longed for the water to close over
me--and I thought that death was the best image of mercy--then goodness
came to me living, and I felt trust in the living. And--it is
strange--but I began to hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was living too. And now I with
you--here--this morning, peace and hope have come into me like a flood.
I want nothing; I can wait; because I hope and believe and am
grateful--oh, so grateful! You have not thought evil of me--you have
not despised me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah spoke with low-toned fervor, and sat as still as a picture all
the while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Many others would have felt as we do, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick,
feeling a mist come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I did not meet them--they did not come to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How was it that you were taken from your mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I am a long while coming to that. It is dreadful to speak of, yet
I must tell you--I must tell you everything. My father--it was he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that
took me away. I thought we were only going on a little journey; and I
was pleased. There was a box with all my little things in. But we went
on board a ship, and got farther and farther away from the land. Then I
was ill; and I thought it would never end--it was the first misery, and
it seemed endless. But at last we landed. I knew nothing then, and
believed what my father said. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comforted me, and told me I should go
back to my mother. But it was America we had reached, and it was long
years before we came back to Europe. At first I often asked my father
when we were going back; and I tried to learn writing fast, because I
wanted to write to my mother; but one day when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found me trying to
write a letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took me on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knee and told me that my mother and
brother were dead; that was why we did not go back. I remember my
brother a little; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) carried me once; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was not always at home. I
believed my father when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said that they were dead. I saw them under
the earth when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said they were there, with their eyes forever closed.
I never thought of its not being true; and I used to cry every night in
my bed for a long while. Then when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came so often to me, in my
sleep, I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must be living about me though I could not always
see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and that comforted me. I was never afraid in the dark, because
of that; and very often in the day I used to shut my eyes and bury my
face and try to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) singing. I came to do that at
last without shutting my eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah paused with a sweet content in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) face, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) were having
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) happy vision, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) looked out toward the river.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still your father was not unkind to you, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick,
after a minute, anxious to recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>).

<p/>``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) petted me, and took pains to teach me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was an actor; and I
found out, after, that the ``Coburg' I used to hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) going to at
home was a theatre. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had more to do with the theatre than acting.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not always been an actor; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been a teacher, and knew many
languages. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) acting was not very good; I think, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) managed the
stage, and wrote and translated plays. An Italian lady, a singer, lived
with us a long time. They both taught me, and I had a master besides,
who made me learn by heart and recite. I worked quite hard, though I
was so little; and I was not nine when I first went on the stage. I
could easily learn things, and I was not afraid. But then and ever
since I hated our way of life. My father had money, and we had finery
about us in a disorderly way; always there were men and women coming
and going; there was loud laughing and disputing, strutting, snapping
of fingers, jeering, faces I did not like to look at--though many
petted and caressed me. But then I remembered my mother. Even at first
when I understood nothing, I shrank away from all those things outside
me into companionship with thoughts that were not like them; and I
gathered thoughts very fast, because I read many things--plays and
poetry, Shakespeare and Schiller, and learned evil and good. My father
began to believe that I might be a great singer: my voice was
considered wonderful for a child; and he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) had the best teaching for me.
But it was painful that he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) boasted of me, and set me to sing for show
at any minute, as if I had been a musical box. Once when I was nine
years old, I played the part of a little girl who had been forsaken and
did not know it, and sat singing to herself while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) played with
flowers. I did it without any trouble; but the clapping and all the
sounds of the theatre were hateful to me; and I never liked the praise
I had, because it all seemed very hard and unloving: I missed the love
and trust I had been born into. I made a life in my own thoughts quite
different from everything about me: I chose what seemed to me beautiful
out of the plays and everything, and made my world out of it; and it
was like a sharp knife always grazing me that we had two sorts of life
which jarred so with each other--women looking good and gentle on the
stage, and saying good things as if they felt them, and directly after
I saw them with coarse, ugly manners. My father sometimes noticed my
shrinking ways; and Signora said one day, when I had been rehearsing,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will never be an artist: she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has no notion of being anybody but
herself. That does very well now, but by-and-by you will see--she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will
have no more face and action than a singing-bird.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My father was angry,
and they quarreled. I sat alone and cried, because what she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had said
was like a long unhappy future unrolled before me. I did not want to be
an artist; but this was what my father expected of me. After a while
Signora left us, and a governess used to come and give me lessons in
different things, because my father began to be afraid of my singing
too much; but I still acted from time to time. Rebellious feelings grew
stronger in me, and I wished to get away from this life; but I could
not tell where to go, and I dreaded the world. Besides, I felt it would
be wrong to leave my father: I dreaded doing wrong, for I thought I
might get wicked and hateful to myself, in the same way that many
others seemed hateful to me. For so long, so long I had never felt my
outside world happy; and if I got wicked I should lose my world of
happy thoughts where my mother lived with me. That was my childish
notion all through those years. Oh how long they were!''

<p/>Mirah fell to musing again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you no teaching about what was your duty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
did not like to say <div class="bookquote">``religion'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--finding herself on inspection rather
dim as to what the Hebrew religion might have turned into at this date.

<p/>``No--only that I ought to do what my father wished. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not follow
our religion at New York, and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wanted me not to know much
about it. But because my mother used to take me to the synagogue, and I
remembered sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knee and looking through the railing and
hearing the chanting and singing, I longed to go. One day when I was
quite small I slipped out and tried to find the synagogue, but I lost
myself a long while till a peddler questioned me and took me home. My
father, missing me, had been much in fear, and was very angry. I too
had been so frightened at losing myself that it was long before I
thought of venturing out again. But after Signora left us we went to
rooms where our landlady was a Jewess and observed her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) religion. I
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to take me with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to the synagogue; and I read in her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
prayer-books and Bible, and when I had money enough I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to buy
me books of my own, for these books seemed a closer companionship with
my mother: I knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must have looked at the very words and said
them. In that way I have come to know a little of our religion, and the
history of our people, besides piecing together what I read in plays
and other books about Jews and Jewesses; because I was sure my mother
obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) religion. I had left off asking my father about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). It is
very dreadful to say it, but I began to disbelieve him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I had found
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not always tell the truth, and made promises without
meaning to keep them; and that raised my suspicion that my mother and
brother were still alive though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had told me they were dead. For in
going over the past again as I got older and knew more, I felt sure
that my mother had been deceived, and had expected to see us back again
after a very little while; and my father taking me on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knee and
telling me that my mother and brother were both dead seemed to me now
but a bit of acting, to set my mind at rest. The cruelty of that
falsehood sank into me, and I hated all untruth because of it. I wrote
to my mother secretly: I knew the street, Colman Street, where we
lived, and that it was not Blackfriars Bridge and the Coburg, and that
our name was Cohen then, though my father called us Lapidoth, because,
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, it was a name of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) forefathers in Poland. I sent my letter
secretly; but no answer came, and I thought there was no hope for me.
Our life in America did not last much longer. My father suddenly told
me we were to pack up and go to Hamburg, and I was rather glad. I hoped
we might get among a different sort of people, and I knew German quite
well--some German plays almost all by heart. My father spoke it better
than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke English. I was thirteen then, and I seemed to myself
quite old--I knew so much, and yet so little. I think other children
cannot feel as I did. I had often wished that I had been drowned when I
was going away from my mother. But I set myself to obey and suffer:
what else could I do? One day when we were on our voyage, a new thought
came into my mind. I was not very ill that time, and I kept on deck a
good deal. My father acted and sang and joked to amuse people on board,
and I used often to hear remarks about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). One day, when I was looking
at the sea and nobody took notice of me, I overheard a gentleman say,
``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is one of those clever Jews--a rascal, I shouldn't wonder.
There's no race like them for cunning in the men and beauty in the
women. I wonder what market he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) means that daughter for.<div class="bookquote">'' When I heard
this it darted into my mind that the unhappiness in my life came from
my being a Jewess, and that always to the end the world would think
slightly of me and that I must bear it, for I should be judged by that
name; and it comforted me to believe that my suffering was part of the
affliction of my people, my part in the long song of mourning that has
been going on through ages and ages. For if many of our race were
wicked and made merry in their wickedness--what was that but part of
the affliction borne by the just among them, who were despised for the
sins of their brethren?--But you have not rejected me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) tone in this last sentence, having suddenly
reflected that at this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had reason not for complaint but for
gratitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And we will try to save you from being judged unjustly by others, my
poor child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, who had now given up all attempt at
going on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) work, and sat listening with folded hands and a face
hardly less eager than Mab's would have been. <div class="bookquote">``Go on, go on: tell me
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``After that we lived in different towns--Hamburg and Vienna, the
longest. I began to study singing again: and my father always got money
about the theatres. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brought a good deal of money from
America, I never knew why we left. For some time he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in great
spirits about my singing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made me rehearse parts and act
continually. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked forward to my coming out in the opera. But
by-and-by it seemed that my voice would never be strong enough--it did
not fulfill its promise. My master at Vienna said, ``Don't strain it
further: it will never do for the public:--it is gold, but a thread of
gold dust.'' My father was bitterly disappointed: we were not so well
off at that time. I think I have not quite told you what I felt about
my father. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was fond of me and meant to indulge me, and that
made me afraid of hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always mistook what would please
me and give me happiness. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nature to take everything lightly;
and I soon left off asking him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) any questions about things that I cared
for much, because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always turned them off with a joke. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would even
ridicule our own people; and once when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been imitating their
movements and their tones in praying, only to make others laugh, I
could not restrain myself--for I always had an anger in my heart about
my mother--and when we were alone, I said, ``Father, you ought not to
mimic our own people before Christians who mock them: would it not be
bad if I mimicked you, that they might mock you?'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only shrugged
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shoulders and laughed and pinched my chin, and said, ``You couldn't
do it, my dear.'' It was this way of turning off everything, that made a
great wall between me and my father, and whatever I felt most I took
the most care to hide from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). For there were some things--when they
were laughed at I could not bear it: the world seemed like a hell to
me. Is this world and all the life upon it only like a farce or a
vaudeville, where you find no great meanings? Why then are there
tragedies and grand operas, where men do difficult things and choose to
suffer? I think it is silly to speak of all things as a joke. And I saw
that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wishing me to sing the greatest music, and parts in grand
operas, was only wishing for what would fetch the greatest price. That
hemmed in my gratitude for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) affectionateness, and the tenderest
feeling I had toward him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was pity. Yes, I did sometimes pity him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had aged and changed. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was no longer so lively. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
seemed worse--less good to others than to me. Every now and then in the
latter years his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gaiety went away suddenly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would sit at home
silent and gloomy; or he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would come in and fling himself down and sob,
just as I have done myself when I have been in trouble. If I put my
hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knee and say, <div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would make
no answer, but would draw my arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) neck and put his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm round
me and go on crying. There never came any confidence between us; but
oh, I was sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). At those moments I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must feel his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life
bitter, and I pressed my cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head and prayed. Those
moments were what most bound me to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and I used to think how much my
mother once loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), else she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not have married him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>``But soon there came the dreadful time. We had been at Pesth and we
came back to Vienna. In spite of what my master Leo had said, my father
got me an engagement, not at the opera, but to take singing parts at a
suburb theatre in Vienna. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had nothing to do with the theatre then; I
did not understand what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did, but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was continually at a
gambling house, though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was careful always about taking me to the
theatre. I was very miserable. The plays I acted in were detestable to
me. Men came about us and wanted to talk to me: women and men seemed to
look at me with a sneering smile; it was no better than a fiery
furnace. Perhaps I make it worse than it was--you don't know that life:
but the glare and the faces, and my having to go on and act and sing
what I hated, and then see people who came to stare at me behind the
scenes--it was all so much worse than when I was a little girl. I went
through with it; I did it; I had set my mind to obey my father and
work, for I saw nothing better that I could do. But I felt that my
voice was getting weaker, and I knew that my acting was not good except
when it was not really acting, but the part was one that I could be
myself in, and some feeling within me carried me along. That was seldom.

<p/>``Then, in the midst of all this, the news came to me one morning that
my father had been taken to prison, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had sent for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not
tell me the reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ordered me to go to an
address he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave me, to see a Count who would be able to get him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
released. The address was to some public rooms where I was to ask for
the Count, and beg him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to come to my father. I found him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and
recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as a gentleman whom I had seen the other night for the
first time behind the scenes. That agitated me, for I remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
way of looking at me and kissing my hand--I thought it was in mockery.
But I delivered my errand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) promised to go immediately to my
father, who came home again that very evening, bringing the Count with
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I now began to feel a horrible dread of this man, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worried
me with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attentions, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were always on me: I felt sure that
whatever else there might be in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind toward me, below it all there
was scorn for the Jewess and the actress. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to me the
next day in the theatre and would put my shawl around me, a terror took
hold of me; I saw that my father wanted me to look pleased. The Count
was neither very young nor very old; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hair and eyes were pale; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
was tall and walked heavily, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face was heavy and grave except
when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked at me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) smiled at me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) smile went through me
with horror: I could not tell why he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so much worse to me than other
men. Some feelings are like our hearing: they come as sounds do, before
we know their reason. My father talked to me about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) when we were
alone, and praised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--said what a good friend he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been. I said
nothing, because I supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had got my father out of prison. When
the Count came again, my father left the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked me if I liked
being on the stage. I said No, I only acted in obedience to my father.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always spoke French, and called me `petite ange' and such things,
which I felt insulting. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meant to make love to me, and I had
it firmly in my mind that a nobleman and one who was not a Jew could
have no love for me that was not half contempt. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) told me
that I need not act any longer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) wished me to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
beautiful place, where I might be queen of everything. It was difficult
to me to speak, I felt so shaken with anger: I could only say, ``I would
rather stay on the stage forever,'' and I left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) there. Hurrying out
of the room I saw my father sauntering in the passage. My heart was
crushed. I went past him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and locked myself up. It had sunk into me that
my father was in a conspiracy with that man against me. But the next
day he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) persuaded me to come out: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said that I had mistaken
everything, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would explain: if I did not come out and act and
fulfill my engagement, we should be ruined and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must starve. So I
went on acting, and for a week or more the Count never came near me. My
father changed our lodgings, and kept at home except when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went to
the theatre with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began one day to speak discouragingly of my
acting, and say, I could never go on singing in public--I should lose
my voice--I ought to think of my future, and not put my nonsensical
feelings between me and my fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, ``What will you do? You
will be brought down to sing and beg at people's doors. You have had a
splendid offer and ought to accept it.'' I could not speak: a horror
took possession of me when I thought of my mother and of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I felt
for the first time that I should not do wrong to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). But the
next day he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had put an end to my engagement at the
theatre, and that we were to go to Prague. I was getting suspicious of
everything, and my will was hardening to act against him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). It took us
two days to pack and get ready; and I had it in my mind that I might be
obliged to run away from my father, and then I would come to London and
try if it were possible to find my mother. I had a little money, and I
sold some things to get more. I packed a few clothes in a little bag
that I could carry with me, and I kept my mind on the watch. My
father's silence--his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) letting drop that subject of the Count's
offer--made me feel sure that there was a plan against me. I felt as if
it had been a plan to take me to a madhouse. I once saw a picture of a
madhouse, that I could never forget; it seemed to me very much like
some of the life I had seen--the people strutting, quarreling,
leering--the faces with cunning and malice in them. It was my will to
keep myself from wickedness; and I prayed for help. I had seen what
despised women were: and my heart turned against my father, for I saw
always behind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that man who made me shudder. You will think I had
not enough reason for my suspicions, and perhaps I had not, outside my
own feeling; but it seemed to me that my mind had been lit up, and all
that might be stood out clear and sharp. If I slept, it was only to see
the same sort of things, and I could hardly sleep at all. Through our
journey I was everywhere on the watch. I don't know why, but it came
before me like a real event, that my father would suddenly leave me and
I should find myself with the Count where I could not get away from
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I thought God was warning me: my mother's voice was in my soul. It
was dark when we reached Prague, and though the strange bunches of
lamps were lit it was difficult to distinguish faces as we drove along
the street. My father chose to sit outside--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was always smoking
now--and I watched everything in spite of the darkness. I do believe I
could see better then than I ever did before: the strange clearness
within seemed to have got outside me. It was not my habit to notice
faces and figures much in the street; but this night I saw every one;
and when we passed before a great hotel I caught sight only of a back
that was passing in--the light of the great bunch of lamps a good way
off fell on it. I knew it--before the face was turned, as it fell into
shadow, I knew who it was. Help came to me. I feel sure help came. I
did not sleep that night. I put on my plainest things--the cloak and
hat I have worn ever since; and I sat watching for the light and the
sound of the doors being unbarred. Some one rose early--at four
o'clock, to go to the railway. That gave me courage. I slipped out,
with my little bag under my cloak, and none noticed me. I had been a
long while attending to the railway guide that I might learn the way to
England; and before the sun had risen I was in the train for Dresden.
Then I cried for joy. I did not know whether my money would last out,
but I trusted. I could sell the things in my bag, and the little rings
in my ears, and I could live on bread only. My only terror was lest my
father should follow me. But I never paused. I came on, and on, and on,
only eating bread now and then. When I got to Brussels I saw that I
should not have enough money, and I sold all that I could sell; but
here a strange thing happened. Putting my hand into the pocket of my
cloak, I found a half-napoleon. Wondering and wondering how it came
there, I remembered that on the way from Cologne there was a young
workman sitting against me. I was frightened at every one, and did not
like to be spoken to. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) tried to talk, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) saw that I
did not like it, he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) left off. It was a long journey; I ate nothing but
a bit of bread, and he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) once offered me some of the food he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) brought in,
but I refused it. I do believe it was he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) who put that bit of gold in my
pocket. Without it I could hardly have got to Dover, and I did walk a
good deal of the way from Dover to London. I knew I should look like a
miserable beggar-girl. I wanted not to look very miserable, because if
I found my mother it would grieve her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to see me so. But oh, how vain my
hope was that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be there to see me come! As soon as I set foot
in London, I began to ask for Lambeth and Blackfriars Bridge, but they
were a long way off, and I went wrong. At last I got to Blackfriars
Bridge and asked for Colman Street. People shook their heads. None knew
it. I saw it in my mind--our doorsteps, and the white tiles hung in the
windows, and the large brick building opposite with wide doors. But
there was nothing like it. At last when I asked a tradesman where the
Coburg Theatre and Colman Street were, he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) said, ``Oh, my little woman,
that's all done away with. The old streets have been pulled down;
everything is new.'' I turned away and felt as if death had laid a hand
on me. He (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) said: ``Stop, stop! young woman; what is it you're wanting
with Colman Street, eh?'' meaning well, perhaps. But his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) tone was what I
could not bear; and how could I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) what I wanted? I felt blinded
and bewildered with a sudden shock. I suddenly felt that I was very
weak and weary, and yet where could I go? for I looked so poor and
dusty, and had nothing with me--I looked like a street-beggar. And I
was afraid of all places where I could enter. I lost my trust. I
thought I was forsaken. It seemed that I had been in a fever of
hope--delirious--all the way from Prague: I thought that I was helped,
and I did nothing but strain my mind forward and think of finding my
mother; and now--there I stood in a strange world. All who saw me would
think ill of me, and I must herd with beggars. I stood on the bridge
and looked along the river. People were going on to a steamboat. Many
of them seemed poor, and I felt as if it would be a refuge to get away
from the streets; perhaps the boat would take me where I could soon get
into a solitude. I had still some pence left, and I bought a loaf when
I went on the boat. I wanted to have a little time and strength to
think of life and death. How could I live? And now again it seemed that
if ever I were to find my mother again, death was the way to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I
ate, that I might have strength to think. The boat set me down at a
place along the river--I don't know where--and it was late in the
evening. I found some large trees apart from the road, and I sat down
under them that I might rest through the night. Sleep must have soon
come to me, and when I awoke it was morning. The birds were singing,
and the dew was white about me, I felt chill and oh, so lonely! I got
up and walked and followed the river a long way and then turned back
again. There was no reason why I should go anywhere. The world about me
seemed like a vision that was hurrying by while I stood still with my
pain. My thoughts were stronger than I was; they rushed in and forced
me to see all my life from the beginning; ever since I was carried away
from my mother I had felt myself a lost child taken up and used by
strangers, who did not care what my life was to me, but only what I
could do for them. It seemed all a weary wandering and
heart-loneliness--as if I had been forced to go to merrymakings without
the expectation of joy. And now it was worse. I was lost again, and I
dreaded lest any stranger should notice me and speak to me. I had a
terror of the world. None knew me; all would mistake me. I had seen so
many in my life who made themselves glad with scorning, and laughed at
another's shame. What could I do? This life seemed to be closing in
upon me with a wall of fire--everywhere there was scorching that made
me shrink. The high sunlight made me shrink. And I began to think that
my despair was the voice of God telling me to die. But it would take me
long to die of hunger. Then I thought of my people, how they had been
driven from land to land and been afflicted, and multitudes had died of
misery in their wandering--was I the first? And in the wars and
troubles when Christians were cruelest, our fathers had sometimes slain
their children and afterward themselves: it was to save them from being
false apostates. That seemed to make it right for me to put an end to
my life; for calamity had closed me in too, and I saw no pathway but to
evil. But my mind got into war with itself, for there were contrary
things in it. I knew that some had held it wrong to hasten their own
death, though they were in the midst of flames; and while I had some
strength left it was a longing to bear if I ought to bear--else where
was the good of all my life? It had not been happy since the first
years: when the light came every morning I used to think, ``I will bear
it.<div class="bookquote">'' But always before I had some hope; now it was gone. With these
thoughts I wandered and wandered, inwardly crying to the Most High,
from whom I should not flee in death more than in life--though I had no
strong faith that He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cared for me. The strength seemed departing from
my soul; deep below all my cries was the feeling that I was alone and
forsaken. The more I thought the wearier I got, till it seemed I was
not thinking at all, but only the sky and the river and the Eternal God
were in my soul. And what was it whether I died or lived? If I lay down
to die in the river, was it more than lying down to sleep?--for there
too I committed my soul--I gave myself up. I could not bear memories
any more; I could only feel what was present in me--it was all one
longing to cease from my weary life, which seemed only a pain outside
the great peace that I might enter into. That was how it was. When the
evening came and the sun was gone, it seemed as if that was all I had
to wait for. And a new strength came into me to will what I would do.
You know what I did. I was going to die. You know what happened--did he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
not tell you? Faith came to me again; I was not forsaken. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) told you
how he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) found me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Meyrick gave no audible answer, but pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) lips against
Mirah's forehead.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s just a pearl; the mud has only washed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>was the fervid
little woman's closing commentary when, _tete-à-tete_ with Deronda in
the back parlor that evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had conveyed Mirah's story to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
with much vividness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your feeling about a search for this mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you no fears? I have, I confess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I believe the mother's good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, with rapid
decisiveness; <div class="bookquote">``or _was_ good. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may be dead--that's my fear. A good
woman, you may depend: you may know it by the scoundrel the father is.
Where did the child get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goodness from? Wheaten flour has to be
accounted for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda was rather disappointed at this answer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had wanted a
confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own judgment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) began to put in demurrers. The
argument about the mother would not apply to the brother; and Mrs.
Meyrick admitted that the brother might be an ugly likeness of the
father. Then, as to advertising, if the name was Cohen, you might as
well advertise for two undescribed terriers; and here Mrs. Meyrick
helped him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), for the idea of an advertisement, already mentioned to
Mirah, had roused the poor child's terror; she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was convinced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
father would see it--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw everything in the papers. Certainly there
were safer means than advertising; men might be set to work whose
business it was to find missing persons; but Deronda wished Mrs.
Meyrick to feel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) that it would be wiser to wait, before seeking
a dubious--perhaps a deplorable result; especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was engaged to
go abroad the next week for a couple of months. If a search were made,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would like to be at hand, so that Mrs. Meyrick might not be unaided
in meeting any consequences--supposing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) would generously
continue to watch over Mirah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We should be very jealous of any one who took the task from us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Meyrick. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will stay under my roof; there is Hans's old room
for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be content to wait?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No trouble there. It is not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nature to run into planning and
devising: only to submit. See how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) submitted to that father! It was
a wonder to herself how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found the will and contrivance to run away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). About finding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only notion now is to trust;
since you were sent to save her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and we are good to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) trusts that
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother will be found in the same unsought way. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is
talking I catch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feeling like a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Meyrick hoped that the sum Deronda put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hands as a
provision for Mirah's wants was more than would be needed; after a
little while Mirah would perhaps like to occupy herself as the other
girls did, and make herself independent. Deronda pleaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) must
need a long rest. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; we will hurry nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rely upon it, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shall be taken tender care of. If you like to give
me your address abroad, I will write to let you know how we get on. It
is not fair that we should have all the pleasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) salvation to
ourselves. And besides, I want to make believe that I am doing
something for you as well as for Mirah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is no make-believe. What should I have done without you last
night? Everything would have gone wrong. I shall tell Hans that the
best of having him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) for a friend is, knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>After that they joined the girls in the other room, where Mirah was
seated placidly, while the others were telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) what they knew about
Mr. Deronda--his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) goodness to Hans, and all the virtues that Hans had
reported of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kate burns a pastille before his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) portrait every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab. <div class="bookquote">``And I
carry his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) signature in a little black-silk bag round my neck to keep
off the cramp. And Amy says the multiplication-table in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) name. We
must all do something extra in honor of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), now he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has brought you to
us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is too great a person to want anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah,
smiling at Mab, and appealing to the graver Amy. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is perhaps very
high in the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is very much above us in rank,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is related to grand
people. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) leans on some of the satin cushions we prick our
fingers over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is of high rank,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) usual quietness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, why are you glad of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy, rather suspicious of this
sentiment, and on the watch for Jewish peculiarities which had not
appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I have always disliked men of high rank before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Deronda is not so very high,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) need not hinder
us from thinking ill of the whole peerage and baronetage if we like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) entered, Mirah rose with the same look of grateful reverence
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had lifted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) the evening before: impossible to see a
creature freer at once from embarrassment and boldness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) theatrical
training had left no recognizable trace; probably her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) manners had not
much changed since she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) played the forsaken child at nine years of age;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had grown up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) simplicity and truthfulness like a little
flower-seed that absorbs the chance confusion of its surrounding into
its own definite mould of beauty. Deronda felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was making
acquaintance with something quite new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in the form of womanhood.
For Mirah was not childlike from ignorance: her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) experience of evil and
trouble was deeper and stranger than his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) felt inclined to watch
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) and listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had come from a far off shore inhabited
by a race different from our own.

<p/>But for that very reason he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) visit brief with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) usual
activity of imagination as to how his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) conduct might affect others, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
shrank from what might seem like curiosity or the assumption of a right
to know as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pleased of one to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had done a service. For
example, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would have liked to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would have felt
the expression of such a wish to be rudeness in him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)--since she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could
not refuse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would all the while have a sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was being
treated like one whose accomplishments were to be ready on demand. And
whatever reverence could be shown to woman, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was bent on showing to
this girl. Why? He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) gave himself several good reasons; but whatever one
does with a strong unhesitating outflow of will has a store of motive
that it would be hard to put into words. Some deeds seem little more
than interjections which give vent to the long passion of a life.

<p/>So Deronda soon took his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) farewell for the two months during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
expected to be absent from London, and in a few days he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) way
with Sir Hugo and Lady Mallinger to Leubronn.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had fulfilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) intention of telling them about Mirah. The baronet
was decidedly of opinion that the search for the mother and brother had
better be let alone. Lady Mallinger was much interested in the poor
girl, observing that there was a society for the conversion of the
Jews, and that it was to be hoped Mirah would embrace Christianity; but
perceiving that Sir Hugo looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) with amusement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) concluded
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) had said something foolish. Lady Mallinger felt apologetically
about herself as a woman who had produced nothing but daughters in a
case where sons were required, and hence regarded the apparent
contradictions of the world as probably due to the weakness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) own
understanding. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) was much puzzled, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) habit to say
to herself, <div class="bookquote">``I will ask Daniel.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Deronda was altogether a convenience
in the family; and Sir Hugo too, after intending to do the best for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>), had begun to feel that the pleasantest result would be to have
this substitute for a son always ready at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) elbow.

<p/>This was the history of Deronda, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) knew it, up to the time
of that visit to Leubronn in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw Gwendolen Harleth at the
gaming-table.




<p/>CHAPTER XXI.

<p/>It is a common sentence that Knowledge is power; but who hath duly
Considered or set forth the power of Ignorance? Knowledge slowly
builds up what Ignorance in an hour pulls down. Knowledge, through
patient and frugal centuries, enlarges discovery and makes record of
it; Ignorance, wanting its day's dinner, lights a fire with the
record, and gives a flavor to its one roast with the burned souls of
many generations. Knowledge, instructing the sense, refining and
multiplying needs, transforms itself into skill and makes life various
with a new six days' work; comes Ignorance drunk on the seventh, with
a firkin of oil and a match and an easy <div class="bookquote">``Let there not be,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the
many-colored creation is shriveled up in blackness. Of a truth,
Knowledge is power, but it is a power reined by scruple, having a
conscience of what must be and what may be; whereas Ignorance is a
blind giant who, let him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) but wax unbound, would make it a sport to
seize the pillars that hold up the long-wrought fabric of human good,
and turn all the places of joy dark as a buried Babylon. And looking
at life parcel-wise, in the growth of a single lot, who having a
practiced vision may not see that ignorance of the true bond between
events, and false conceit of means whereby sequences may be compelled
--like that falsity of eyesight which overlooks the gradations of
distance, seeing that which is afar off as if it were within a step or
a grasp--precipitates the mistaken soul on destruction?


<p/>It was half-past ten in the morning when Gwendolen Harleth, after her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
gloomy journey from Leubronn, arrived at the station from which she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
must drive to Offendene. No carriage or friend was awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), for in
the telegram she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had sent from Dover she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had mentioned a later train,
and in her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) impatience of lingering at a London station she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had set off
without picturing what it would be to arrive unannounced at half an
hour's drive from home--at one of those stations which have been fixed
on not as near anywhere, but as equidistant from everywhere. Deposited
as a _femme sole_ with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) large trunks, and having to wait while a
vehicle was being got from the large-sized lantern called the Railway
Inn, Gwendolen felt that the dirty paint in the waiting-room, the dusty
decanter of flat water, and the texts in large letters calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
to repent and be converted, were part of the dreary prospect opened by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) family troubles; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hurried away to the outer door looking
toward the lane and fields. But here the very gleams of sunshine seemed
melancholy, for the autumnal leaves and grass were shivering, and the
wind was turning up the feathers of a cock and two croaking hens which
had doubtless parted with their grown-up offspring and did not know
what to do with themselves. The railway official also seemed without
resources, and his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) innocent demeanor in observing Gwendolen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
trunks was rendered intolerable by the cast in his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) eye; especially
since, being a new man, he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and must conclude that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was not very high in the world. The vehicle--a dirty old barouche--was
within sight, and was being slowly prepared by an elderly laborer.
Contemptible details these, to make part of a history; yet the turn of
most lives is hardly to be accounted for without them. They are
continually entering with cumulative force into a mood until it gets
the mass and momentum of a theory or a motive. Even philosophy is not
quite free from such determining influences; and to be dropped solitary
at an ugly, irrelevant-looking spot, with a sense of no income on the
mind, might well prompt a man to discouraging speculation on the origin
of things and the reason of a world where a subtle thinker found
himself so badly off. How much more might such trifles tell on a young
lady equipped for society with a fastidious taste, an Indian shawl over
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arm, some twenty cubic feet of trunks by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) side, and a mortal
dislike to the new consciousness of poverty which was stimulating her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
imagination of disagreeables? At any rate they told heavily on poor
Gwendolen, and helped to quell her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resistant spirit. What was the good
of living in the midst of hardships, ugliness, and humiliation? This
was the beginning of being at home again, and it was a sample of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had to expect.

<p/>Here was the theme on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) discontent rung its sad changes during
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) slow drive in the uneasy barouche, with one great trunk squeezing
the meek driver, and the other fastened with a rope on the seat in
front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ruling vision all the way from Leubronn had been that
the family would go abroad again; for of course there must be some
little income left--her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma did not mean that they would have
literally nothing. To go to a dull place abroad and live poorly, was
the dismal future that threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had seen plenty of poor
English people abroad and imagined herself plunged in the despised
dullness of their ill-plenished lives, with Alice, Bertha, Fanny and
Isabel all growing up in tediousness around her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) advanced
toward thirty and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mamma got more and more melancholy. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did
not mean to submit, and let misfortune do what it would with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had not yet quite believed in the misfortune; but weariness and disgust
with this wretched arrival had begun to affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) like an
uncomfortable waking, worse than the uneasy dreams which had gone
before. The self-delight with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) image in the
glass had faded before the sense of futility in being anything
whatever--charming, clever, resolute--what was the good of it all?
Events might turn out anyhow, and men were hateful. Yes, men were
hateful. But in these last hours, a certain change had come over their
meaning. It is one thing to hate stolen goods, and another thing to
hate them the more because their being stolen hinders us from making
use of them. Gwendolen had begun to be angry with Grandcourt for being
what had hindered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) as the cause of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) present dreary lot.

<p/>But the slow drive was nearly at an end, and the lumbering vehicle
coming up the avenue was within sight of the windows. A figure
appearing under the portico brought a rush of new and less selfish
feeling in Gwendolen, and when springing from the carriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw the
dear beautiful face with fresh lines of sadness in it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's neck, and for the moment felt all sorrows only
in relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's feeling about them.

<p/>Behind, of course, were the sad faces of the four superfluous girls,
each, poor thing--like those other many thousand sisters of us
all--having her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) peculiar world which was of no importance to any one
else, but all of them feeling Gwendolen's presence to be somehow a
relenting of misfortune: where Gwendolen was, something interesting
would happen; even her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hurried submission to their kisses, and <div class="bookquote">``Now go
away, girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>carried the sort of comfort which all weakness finds in
decision and authoritativeness. Good Miss Merry, whose air of meek
depression, hitherto held unaccountable in a governess affectionately
attached to the family, was now at the general level of circumstances,
did not expect any greeting, but busied herself with the trunks and the
coachman's pay; while Mrs. Davilow and Gwendolen hastened up-stairs and
shut themselves in the black and yellow bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, mamma dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, tenderly pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
handkerchief against the tears that were rolling down Mrs. Davilow's
cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind. I don't mind. I will do something. I will be
something. Things will come right. It seemed worse because I was away.
Come now! you must be glad because I am here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen felt every word of that speech. A rush of compassionate
tenderness stirred all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) capability of generous resolution; and the
self-confident projects which had vaguely glanced before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) during her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
journey sprang instantaneously into new definiteness. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
seemed to perceive how she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could be <div class="bookquote">``something.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) best
moments, and the fond mother, forgetting everything below that tide
mark, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with a sort of adoration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, my good, good darling! I can be happy, if you can!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>But later in the day there was an ebb; the old slippery rocks, the old
weedy places reappeared. Naturally, there was a shrinking of courage as
misfortune ceased to be a mere announcement, and began to disclose
itself as a grievous tyrannical inmate. At first--that ugly drive at an
end--it was still Offendene that Gwendolen had come home to, and all
surroundings of immediate consequence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were still there to secure
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) personal ease; the roomy stillness of the large solid house while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rested; all the luxuries of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) toilet cared for without trouble to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and a little tray with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) favorite food brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in
private. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``Keep them all away from us to-day, mamma.
Let you and me be alone together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When Gwendolen came down into the drawing-room, fresh as a newly-dipped
swan, and sat leaning against the cushions of the settee beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mamma, their misfortune had not yet turned its face and breath upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt prepared to hear everything, and began in a tone of
deliberate intention--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you thought of doing, exactly, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, the next thing to be done is to move away from this
house. Mr. Haynes most fortunately is as glad to have it now as he (<font color='blue'><b>Haynes</b></font>)
would have been when we took it. Lord Brackenshaw's agent is to arrange
everything with him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) to the best advantage for us: Bazley, you know; not
at all an ill-natured man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot help thinking that Lord Brackenshaw would let you stay here
rent-free, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, whose talents had not been applied
to business so much as to discernment of the admiration excited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
charms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, Lord Brackenshaw is in Scotland, and knows nothing
about us. Neither your uncle nor I would choose to apply to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).
Besides, what could we do in this house without servants, and without
money to warm it? The sooner we are out the better. We have nothing to
carry but our clothes, you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you mean to go abroad, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. After all,
this is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had familiarized her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind with.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, dear, no. How could we travel? You never did learn anything
about income and expenses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, trying to smile, and
putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) hand on Gwendolen's as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) added, mournfully, <div class="bookquote">``that makes
it so much harder for you, my pet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But where are we to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a trace of sharpness in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt a new current of fear passing through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all decided. A little furniture is to be got in from the
rectory--all that can be spared.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Davilow hesitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) dreaded
the reality for herself less than the shock she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) must give to Gwendolen,
who looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with tense expectancy, but was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Sawyer's Cottage we are to go to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>At first, Gwendolen remained silent, paling with anger--justifiable
anger, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) opinion. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said with haughtiness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is impossible. Something else than that ought to have been
thought of. My uncle ought not to allow that. I will not submit to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sweet child, what else could have been thought of? Your uncle, I am
sure, is as kind as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) can be: but he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is suffering himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
family to bring up. And do you quite understand? You must remember--we
have nothing. We shall have absolutely nothing except what he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) and my
sister give us. They have been as wise and active a possible, and we
must try to earn something. I and the girls are going to work a
table-cloth border for the Ladies' Charity at Winchester, and a
communion cloth that the parishioners are to present to Pennicote
Church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow went into these details timidly: but how else was she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) to
bring the fact of their position home to this poor child who, alas!
must submit at present, whatever might be in the background for her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)?
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) herself had a superstition that there must be something better
in the background.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely somewhere else than Sawyer's Cottage might have been
found,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen persisted--taken hold of -LRB-as if in a nightmare-RRB- by
the image of this house where an exciseman had lived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, dear. You know houses are scarce, and we may be thankful
to get anything so private. It is not so very bad. There are two little
parlors and four bedrooms. You shall sit alone whenever you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/>The ebb of sympathetic care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma had gone so low just now,
that Gwendolen took no notice of these deprecatory words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot conceive that all your property is gone at once, mamma. How
can you be sure in so short a time? It is not a week since you wrote to
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The first news came much earlier, dear. But I would not spoil your
pleasure till it was quite necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how vexatious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, coloring with fresh anger. <div class="bookquote">``If I
had known, I could have brought home the money I had won: and for want
of knowing, I stayed and lost it. I had nearly two hundred pounds, and
it would have done for us to live on a little while, till I could carry
out some plan.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) paused an instant and then added more impetuously,
<div class="bookquote">``Everything has gone against me. People have come near me only to
blight me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Among the <div class="bookquote">``people''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was including Deronda. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not interfered
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have gone to the gaming-table again with a few
napoleons, and might have won back her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) losses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must resign ourselves to the will of Providence, my child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said
poor Mrs. Davilow, startled by this revelation of the gambling, but not
daring to say more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) felt sure that <div class="bookquote">``people''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>meant Grandcourt, about
whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) lips were sealed. And Gwendolen answered immediately--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't resign myself. I shall do what I can against it. What is
the good of calling the people's wickedness Providence? You said in
your letter it was Mr. Lassman's fault we had lost our money. Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Lassman</b></font>)
run away with it all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, you don't understand. There were great speculations: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lassman</b></font>)
meant to gain. It was all about mines and things of that sort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lassman</b></font>)
risked too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't call that Providence: it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lassman</b></font>) improvidence with our money,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lassman</b></font>) ought to be punished. Can't we go to law and recover our
fortune? My uncle ought to take measures, and not sit down by such
wrongs. We ought to go to law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, law can never bring back money lost in that way. Your
uncle says it is milk spilled upon the ground. Besides, one must have a
fortune to get any law: there is no law for people who are ruined. And
our money has only gone along with other's people's. We are not the
only sufferers: others have to resign themselves besides us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't resign myself to live at Sawyer's Cottage and see you
working for sixpences and shillings because of that. I shall not do it.
I shall do what is more befitting our rank and education.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure your uncle and all of us will approve of that, dear, and
admire you the more for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, glad of an unexpected
opening for speaking on a difficult subject. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean that you
should resign yourself to worse when anything better offered itself.
Both your uncle and aunt have felt that your abilities and education
were a fortune for you, and they have already heard of something within
your reach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>some of Gwendolen's anger gave way to interest,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not without romantic conjectures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two situations that offer themselves. One is in a bishop's
family, where there are three daughters, and the other is in quite a
high class of school; and in both, your French, and music, and
dancing--and then your manners and habits as a lady, are exactly what
is wanted. Each is a hundred a year--and--just for the present,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>--Mrs.
Davilow had become frightened and hesitating,--<div class="bookquote">``to save you from the
petty, common way of living that we must go to--you would perhaps
accept one of the two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! be like Miss Graves at Madame Meunier's? No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, myself, that Dr. Monpert's would be more suitable. There
could be no hardship in a bishop's family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, mamma. There are hardships everywhere for a governess. And
I don't see that it would be pleasanter to be looked down on in a
bishop's family than in any other. Besides, you know very well I hate
teaching. Fancy me shut up with three awkward girls something like
Alice! I would rather emigrate than be a governess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>What it precisely was to emigrate, Gwendolen was not called on to
explain. Mrs. Davilow was mute, seeing no outlet, and thinking with
dread of the collision that might happen when Gwendolen had to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
uncle and aunt. There was an air of reticence in Gwendolen's haughty,
resistant speeches which implied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a definite plan in
reserve; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) practical ignorance continually exhibited, could not
nullify the mother's belief in the effectiveness of that forcible will
and daring which had held mastery over herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have some ornaments, mamma, and I could sell them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.
<div class="bookquote">``They would make a sum: I want a little sum--just to go on with. I dare
say Marshall, at Wanchester, would take them: I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshall</b></font>) showed me some
bracelets once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshall</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshall</b></font>) had bought from a lady. Jocosa might go
and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshall</b></font>). Jocosa is going to leave us, of course. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might do
that first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would do anything she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could, poor, dear soul. I have not told you
yet--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wanted me to take all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) savings--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) three hundred pounds. I
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to set up a little school. It will be hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to go into
a new family now she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has been so long with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for the bishop's daughter's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a
sudden gleam of laughter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will do better
than I should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do take care not to say such things to your uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will be hurt at your despising what he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has exerted himself about.
But I dare say you have something else in your mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) might not
disapprove, if you consulted him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is some one else I want to consult first. Are the Arrowpoint's
at Quetcham still, and is Herr Klesmer there? But I daresay you know
nothing about it, poor, dear mamma. Can Jeffries go on horseback with a
note?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, Jefferies is not here, and the dealer has taken the
horses. But some one could go for us from Leek's farm. The Arrowpoints
are at Quetcham, I know. Miss Arrowpoint left her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) card the other day: I
could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>). But I don't know about Herr Klesmer. Do you want to
send before to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, as soon as possible. I will write a note,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, rising.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can you be thinking of, Gwen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, relieved in the
midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) wonderment by signs of alacrity and better humor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind what, there's a dear, good mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
reseating herself a moment to give atoning caresses. <div class="bookquote">``I mean to do
something. Never mind what until it is all settled. And then you shall
be comforted. The dear face!--it is ten years older in these three
weeks. Now, now, now! don't cry'' (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>--Gwendolen, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's head
with both hands, kissed the trembling eyelids. <div class="bookquote">``But mind you don't
contradict me or put hindrances in my way. I must decide for myself. I
cannot be dictated to by my uncle or any one else. My life is my own
affair. And I think'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--here her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tone took an edge of scorn--<div class="bookquote">``I think I
can do better for you than let you live in Sawyer's Cottage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>In uttering this last sentence Gwendolen again rose, and went to a desk
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wrote the following note to Klesmer:--

<p/>Miss Harleth presents her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) compliments to Herr Klesmer, and ventures
to request of him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) the very great favor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) will call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>), if
possible, to-morrow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) reason for presuming so far on his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) kindness
is of a very serious nature. Unfortunate family circumstances have
obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) to take a course in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) can only turn for advice to
the great knowledge and judgment of Herr Klesmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray get this sent to Quetcham at once, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
addressed the letter. <div class="bookquote">``The man must be told to wait for an answer. Let
no time be lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For the moment, the absorbing purpose was to get the letter dispatched;
but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been assured on this point, another anxiety arose and
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in a state of uneasy excitement. If Klesmer happened not to be
at Quetcham, what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) do next? Gwendolen's belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) star, so
to speak, had had some bruises. Things had gone against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). A splendid
marriage which presented itself within reach had shown a hideous flaw.
The chances of roulette had not adjusted themselves to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) claims; and
a man of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew nothing had thrust himself between her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
intentions. The conduct of those uninteresting people who managed the
business of the world had been culpable just in the points most
injurious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in particular. Gwendolen Harleth, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) beauty
and conscious force, felt the close threats of humiliation: for the
first time the conditions of this world seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) like a hurrying
roaring crowd in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had got astray, no more cared for and
protected than a myriad of other girls, in spite of its being a
peculiar hardship to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). If Klesmer were not at Quetcham--that would
be all of a piece with the rest: the unwelcome negative urged itself as
a probability, and set her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brain working at desperate alternatives
which might deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from Sawyer's Cottage or the ultimate necessity
of <div class="bookquote">``taking a situation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sawyer</b></font>)</div>a phrase that summed up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) the
disagreeables most wounding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pride, most irksome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tastes;
at least so far as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) experience enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to imagine disagreeables.

<p/>Still Klesmer might be there, and Gwendolen thought of the result in
that case with a hopefulness which even cast a satisfactory light over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) peculiar troubles, as what might well enter into the biography of
celebrities and remarkable persons. And if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) immediate
acquaintances cross-examined as to whether they thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) remarkable,
the first who said <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>acquaintances</b></font>)</div>would have surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XXII.

<p/>We please our fancy with ideal webs
Of innovation, but our life meanwhile
Is in the loom, where busy passion plies
The shuttle to and fro, and gives our deeds
The accustomed pattern.


<p/>Gwendolen's note, coming <div class="bookquote">``pat betwixt too early and too late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>was put
into Klesmer's hands just when he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) was leaving Quetcham, and in order to
meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) kindness he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>), with some inconvenience to himself
spent the night at Wanchester. There were reasons why he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) would not
remain at Quetcham.

<p/>That magnificent mansion, fitted with regard to the greatest expense,
had in fact became too hot for him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>), its owners having, like some great
politicians, been astonished at an insurrection against the established
order of things, which we plain people after the event can perceive to
have been prepared under their very noses.

<p/>There were as usual many guests in the house, and among them one in
whom Miss Arrowpoint foresaw a new pretender to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) hand: a political
man of good family who confidently expected a peerage, and felt on
public grounds that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) required a larger fortune to support the title
properly. Heiresses vary, and persons interested in one of them
beforehand are prepared to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) is too yellow or too red, tall
and toppling or short and square, violent and capricious or moony and
insipid; but in every case it is taken for granted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) will
consider herself an appendage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) fortune, and marry where others
think her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) fortunes ought to go. Nature, however, not only accommodates
herself ill to our favorite practices by making <div class="bookquote">``only children''
 (<font color='red'><b>daughters</b></font>)</div>daughters, but also now and then endows the misplaced daughter with a
clear head and a strong will. The Arrowpoints had already felt some
anxiety owing to these endowments of their Catherine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would not
accept the view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) social duty which required her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to marry a needy
nobleman or a commoner on the ladder toward nobility; and they were not
without uneasiness concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) persistence in declining suitable
offers. As to the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being in love with Klesmer they
were not at all uneasy--a very common sort of blindness. For in general
mortals have a great power of being astonished at the presence of an
effect toward which they have done everything, and at the absence of an
effect toward which they had done nothing but desire it. Parents are
astonished at the ignorance of their sons, though they have used the
most time-honored and expensive means of securing it; husbands and
wives are mutually astonished at the loss of affection which they have
taken no pains to keep; and all of us in our turn are apt to be
astonished that our neighbors do not admire us. In this way it happens
that the truth seems highly improbable. The truth is something
different from the habitual lazy combinations begotten by our wishes.
The Arrowpoints' hour of astonishment was come.

<p/>When there is a passion between an heiress and a proud
independent-spirited man, it is difficult for them to come to an
understanding; but the difficulties are likely to be overcome unless
the proud man secures himself by a constant _alibi_. Brief meetings
after studied absence are potent in disclosure: but more potent still
is frequent companionship, with full sympathy in taste and admirable
qualities on both sides; especially where the one is in the position of
teacher and the other is delightedly conscious of receptive ability
which also gives the teacher delight. The situation is famous in
history, and has no less charm now than it had in the days of Abelard.

<p/>But this kind of comparison had not occurred to the Arrowpoints when
they first engaged Klesmer to come down to Quetcham. To have a
first-rate musician in your house is a privilege of wealth; Catherine's
musical talent demanded every advantage; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) particularly desired
to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) quieter time in the country for more thorough study. Klesmer
was not yet a Liszt, understood to be adored by ladies of all European
countries with the exception of Lapland: and even with that
understanding it did not follow that he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) would make proposals to an
heiress. No musician of honor would do so. Still less was it
conceivable that Catherine would give him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) the slightest pretext for
such daring. The large check that Mr. Arrowpoint was to draw in
Klesmer's name seemed to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) as safe an inmate as a footman. Where
marriage is inconceivable, a girl's sentiments are safe.

<p/>Klesmer was eminently a man of honor, but marriages rarely begin with
formal proposals, and moreover, Catherine's limit of the conceivable
did not exactly correspond with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother's.

<p/>Outsiders might have been more apt to think that Klesmer's position was
dangerous for himself if Miss Arrowpoint had been an acknowledged
beauty; not taking into account that the most powerful of all beauty is
that which reveals itself after sympathy and not before it. There is a
charm of eye and lip which comes with every little phrase that
certifies delicate perception or fine judgment, with every
unostentatious word or smile that shows a heart awake to others; and no
sweep of garment or turn of figure is more satisfying than that which
enters as a restoration of confidence that one person is present on
whom no intention will be lost. What dignity of meaning goes on
gathering in frowns and laughs which are never observed in the wrong
place; what suffused adorableness in a human frame where there is a
mind that can flash out comprehension and hands that can execute
finely! The more obvious beauty, also adorable sometimes--one may say
it without blasphemy--begins by being an apology for folly, and ends
like other apologies in becoming tiresome by iteration; and that
Klesmer, though very susceptible to it, should have a passionate
attachment to Miss Arrowpoint, was no more a paradox than any other
triumph of a manifold sympathy over a monotonous attraction. We object
less to be taxed with the enslaving excess of our passions than with
our deficiency in wider passion; but if the truth were known, our
reputed intensity is often the dullness of not knowing what else to do
with ourselves. Tannhäuser, one suspects, was a knight of ill-furnished
imagination, hardly of larger discourse than a heavy Guardsman; Merlin
had certainly seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) best days, and was merely repeating himself,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) fell into that hopeless captivity; and we know that Ulysses
felt so manifest an _ennui_ under similar circumstances that Calypso
herself furthered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) departure. There is indeed a report that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>)
afterward left Penelope; but since she (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) was habitually absorbed in
worsted work, and it was probably from her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) that Telemachus got his (<font color='blue'><b>Telemachus</b></font>)
mean, pettifogging disposition, always anxious about the property and
the daily consumption of meat, no inference can be drawn from this
already dubious scandal as to the relation between companionship and
constancy.

<p/>Klesmer was as versatile and fascinating as a young Ulysses on a
sufficient acquaintance--one whom nature seemed to have first made
generously and then to have added music as a dominant power using all
the abundant rest, and, as in Mendelssohn, finding expression for
itself not only in the highest finish of execution, but in that fervor
of creative work and theoretic belief which pierces devoted purpose.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) foibles of arrogance and vanity did not exceed such as may be found
in the best English families; and Catherine Arrowpoint had no
corresponding restlessness to clash with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>): notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
native kindliness she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was perhaps too coolly firm and self-sustained.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was one of those satisfactory creatures whose intercourse has
the charm of discovery; whose integrity of faculty and expression
begets a wish to know what they will say on all subjects or how they
will perform whatever they undertake; so that they end by raising not
only a continual expectation but a continual sense of fulfillment--the
systole and diastole of blissful companionship. In such cases the
outward presentment easily becomes what the image is to the worshipper.
It was not long before the two became aware that each was interesting
to the other; but the <div class="bookquote">``how far''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>remained a matter of doubt. Klesmer did
not conceive that Miss Arrowpoint was likely to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) as a
possible lover, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) was not accustomed to think of herself as
likely to stir more than a friendly regard, or to fear the expression
of more from any man who was not enamored of her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) fortune. Each was
content to suffer some unshared sense of denial for the sake of loving
the other's society a little too well; and under these conditions no
need had been felt to restrict Klesmer's visits for the last year
either in country or in town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) knew very well that if Miss Arrowpoint
had been poor he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) would have made ardent love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) instead of sending
a storm through the piano, or folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) arms and pouring out a
hyperbolical tirade about something as impersonal as the north pole;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) was not less aware that if it had been possible for Klesmer to
wish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) would have found overmastering reasons for giving
it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>). Here was the safety of full cups, which are as secure from
overflow as the half-empty, always supposing no disturbance. Naturally,
silent feeling had not remained at the same point any more than the
stealthly dial-hand, and in the present visit to Quetcham, Klesmer had
begun to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) would not come again; while Catherine was more
sensitive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) frequent _brusquerie_, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rather resented as a
needless effort to assert his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) footing of superior in every sense except
the conventional.

<p/>Meanwhile enters the expectant peer, Mr. Bult, an esteemed party man
who, rather neutral in private life, had strong opinions concerning the
districts of the Niger, was much at home also in Brazils, spoke with
decision of affairs in the South Seas, was studious of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
Parliamentary and itinerant speeches, and had the general solidity and
suffusive pinkness of a healthy Briton on the central table-land of
life. Catherine, aware of a tacit understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) was an
undeniable husband for an heiress, had nothing to say against him (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) but
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) was thoroughly tiresome to her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>). Mr. Bult was amiably confident,
and had no idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bult</b></font>) insensibility to counterpoint could ever be
reckoned against him (<font color='blue'><b>Bult</b></font>). Klesmer he (<font color='blue'><b>Bult</b></font>) hardly regarded in the light of a
serious human being who ought to have a vote; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bult</b></font>) did not mind Miss
Arrowpoint's addiction to music any more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) probable expenses in
antique lace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bult</b></font>) was consequently a little amazed at an after-dinner
outburst of Klesmer's on the lack of idealism in English politics,
which left all mutuality between distant races to be determined simply
by the need of a market; the crusades, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) mind, had at least this
excuse, that they had a banner of sentiment round which generous
feelings could rally: of course, the scoundrels rallied too, but what
then? they rally in equal force round your advertisement van of <div class="bookquote">``Buy
cheap, sell dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>On this theme Klesmer's eloquence, gesticulatory and
other, went on for a little while like stray fireworks accidentally
ignited, and then sank into immovable silence. Mr. Bult was not
surprised that Klesmer's opinions should be flighty, but was astonished
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) command of English idiom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) ability to put a point in a way
that would have told at a constituents' dinner--to be accounted for
probably by his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) being a Pole, or a Czech, or something of that
fermenting sort, in a state of political refugeeism which had obliged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) to make a profession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) music; and that evening in the
drawing-room he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) for the first time went up to Klesmer at the piano,
Miss Arrowpoint being near, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no idea before that you were a political man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Klesmer's only answer was to fold his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) arms, put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) nether lip, and
stare at Mr. Bult.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have been used to public speaking. You speak uncommonly well,
though I don't agree with you. From what you said about sentiment, I
fancy you are a Panslavist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; my name is Elijah. I am the Wandering Jew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, flashing
a smile at Miss Arrowpoint, and suddenly making a mysterious, wind-like
rush backward and forward on the piano. Mr. Bult felt this buffoonery
rather offensive and Polish, but--Miss Arrowpoint being there--did not
like to move away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Herr Klesmer has cosmopolitan ideas,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Arrowpoint, trying to
make the best of the situation. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) looks forward to a fusion of races.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bult/Bult</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bult, willing to be gracious. <div class="bookquote">``I was sure
he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had too much talent to be a mere musician.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, sir, you are under some mistake there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, firing up.
<div class="bookquote">``No man has too much talent to be a musician. Most men have too little.
A creative artist is no more a mere musician than a great statesman is
a mere politician. We are not ingenious puppets, sir, who live in a box
and look out on the world only when it is gaping for amusement. We help
to rule the nations and make the age as much as any other public men.
We count ourselves on level benches with legislators. And a man who
speaks effectively through music is compelled to something more
difficult than parliamentary eloquence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/>With the last word Klesmer wheeled from the piano and walked away.

<p/>Miss Arrowpoint colored, and Mr. Bult observed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bult</b></font>) usual
phlegmatic stolidity, <div class="bookquote">``Your pianist does not think small beer of
himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bult/Bult</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Herr Klesmer is something more than a pianist,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Arrowpoint,
apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) is a great musician in the fullest sense of the
word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) will rank with Schubert and Mendelssohn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you ladies understand these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bult/Bult</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bult, none the less
convinced that these things were frivolous because Klesmer had shown
himself a coxcomb.

<p/>Catherine, always sorry when Klesmer gave himself airs, found an
opportunity the next day in the music-room to say, <div class="bookquote">``Why were you so
heated last night with Mr. Bult? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bult</b></font>) meant no harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wish me to be complaisant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bult</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, rather fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is hardly worth your while to be other than civil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You find no difficulty in tolerating him (<font color='blue'><b>Bult</b></font>), then?--you have a respect
for a political platitudinarian as insensible as an ox to everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Bult</b></font>)
can't turn into political capital. You think his (<font color='blue'><b>Bult</b></font>) monumental obtuseness
suited to the dignity of the English gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that I acted without dignity, and you are offended with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you are slightly nearer the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I had better put my burial-clothes in my portmanteau and set off
at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that. If I have to bear your criticism of my operetta, you
should not mind my criticism of your impatience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do mind it. You would have wished me to take his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ignorant
impertinence about a `mere musician' without letting him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) know his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
place. I am to hear my gods blasphemed as well as myself insulted. But
I beg pardon. It is impossible you should see the matter as I do. Even
you can't understand the wrath of the artist: he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) is of another caste
for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, with some betrayal of feeling. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) is
of a caste to which I look up--a caste above mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Klesmer, who had been seated at a table looking over scores, started up
and walked to a little distance, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is finely felt--I am grateful. But I had better go, all the same.
I have made up my mind to go, for good and all. You can get on
exceedingly well without me: your operetta is on wheels--it will go of
itself. And your Mr. Bull's company fits me `wie die Faust ins Auge.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I
am neglecting my engagements. I must go off to St. Petersburg.''

<p/>There was no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You agree with me that I had better go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, with some
irritation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly; if that is what your business and feeling prompt. I have
only to wonder that you have consented to give us so much of your time
in the last year. There must be treble the interest to you anywhere
else. I have never thought of you consenting to come here as anything
else than a sacrifice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I make the sacrifice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, going to seat himself
at the piano, and touching the keys so as to give with the delicacy of
an echo in the far distance a melody which he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had set to Heine's <div class="bookquote">``Ich
hab' dich geliebet und liebe dich noch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>HEINE/Heine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the mystery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, not wanting to affect anything,
but from mere agitation. From the same cause she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was tearing a piece of
paper into minute morsels, as if at a task of utmost multiplication
imposed by a cruel fairy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can conceive no motive?''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None that seems in the least probable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall tell you. It is because you are to me the chief woman in
the world--the throned lady whose colors I carry between my heart and
my armor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine's hands trembled so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could no longer tear the
paper: still less could her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips utter a word. Klesmer went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This would be the last impertinence in me, if I meant to found
anything upon it. That is out of the question. I meant no such thing.
But you once said it was your doom to suspect every man who courted you
of being an adventurer, and what made you angriest was men's imputing
to you the folly of believing that they courted you for your own sake.
Did you not say so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer, in a low murmur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a bitter word. Well, at least one man who has seen women as
plenty as flowers in May has lingered about you for your own sake. And
since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is one whom you can never marry, you will believe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). There
is an argument in favor of some other man. But don't give yourself for
a meal to a minotaur like Bult. I shall go now and pack. I shall make
my excuses to Mrs. Arrowpoint.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Klesmer rose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) ended, and walked
quickly toward the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must take this heap of manuscript,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>then said Catherine, suddenly
making a desperate effort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had risen to fetch the heap from another
table. Klesmer came back, and they had the length of the folio sheets
between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I not marry the man who loves me, if I love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said
Catherine. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) the effort was something like the leap of a woman
from the deck into the lifeboat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be too hard--impossible--you could not carry it through. I am
not worth what you would have to encounter. I will not accept the
sacrifice. It would be thought a _mésalliance_ for you and I should be
liable to the worst accusations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it the accusations you are afraid of? I am afraid of nothing but
that we should miss the passing of our lives together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The decisive word had been spoken: there was no doubt concerning the
end willed by each: there only remained the way of arriving at it, and
Catherine determined to take the straightest possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father and mother in the library, and told them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had promised
to marry Klesmer.

<p/>Mrs. Arrowpoint's state of mind was pitiable. Imagine Jean Jacques,
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) essay on the corrupting influence of the arts, waking up
among children of nature who had no idea of grilling the raw bone they
offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) for breakfast with the primitive flint knife; or Saint
Just, after fervidly denouncing all recognition of pre-eminence,
receiving a vote of thanks for the unbroken mediocrity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) speech,
which warranted the dullest patriots in delivering themselves at equal
length. Something of the same sort befell the authoress of <div class="bookquote">``Tasso,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the authoress</b></font>)</div>when what she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) had safely demanded of the dead Leonora was enacted by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) own Catherine. It is hard for us to live up to our own eloquence,
and keep pace with our winged words, while we are treading the solid
earth and are liable to heavy dining. Besides, it has long been
understood that the proprieties of literature are not those of
practical life. Mrs. Arrowpoint naturally wished for the best of
everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) not only liked to feel herself at a higher level of
literary sentiment than the ladies with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) associated; she (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) wished
not to be behind them in any point of social consideration. While
Klesmer was seen in the light of a patronized musician, his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
peculiarities were picturesque and acceptable: but to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) by a
sudden flash in the light of her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) son-in-law gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) a burning sense of
what the world would say. And the poor lady had been used to represent
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Catherine as a model of excellence.

<p/>Under the first shock she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forgot everything but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) anger, and snatched
at any phrase that would serve as a weapon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Klesmer has presumed to offer himself to you, your father shall
horsewhip him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) off the premises. Pray, speak, Mr. Arrowpoint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The father</b></font>)</div><p/>The father took his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cigar from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mouth, and rose to the occasion by
saying, <div class="bookquote">``This will never do, Cath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Arrowpoint; <div class="bookquote">``who in their senses ever thought it would
do? You might as well say poisoning and strangling will not do. It is a
comedy you have got up, Catherine. Else you are mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite sane and serious, mamma, and Herr Klesmer is not to blame.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) never thought of my marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>). I found out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) loved me, and
loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>), I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) I would marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave that unsaid, Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint, bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Every
one else will say that for you. You will be a public fable. Every one
will say that you must have made an offer to a man who has been paid to
come to the house--who is nobody knows what--a gypsy, a Jew, a mere
bubble of the earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, indignant in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turn. <div class="bookquote">``We all
know he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is a genius--as Tasso was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those times were not these, nor is Klesmer Tasso,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Arrowpoint, getting more heated. <div class="bookquote">``There is no sting in _that_ sarcasm,
except the sting of undutifulness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hurt you, mamma. But I will not give up the happiness of
my life to ideas that I don't believe in and customs I have no respect
for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have lost all sense of duty, then? You have forgotten that you are
our only child--that it lies with you to place a great property in the
right hands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are the right hands? My grandfather gained the property in trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Arrowpoint, _will_ you sit by and hear this without speaking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a gentleman, Cath. We expect you to marry a gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the
father, exerting himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And a man connected with the institutions of this country,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the
mother. <div class="bookquote">``A woman in your position has serious duties. Where duty and
inclination clash, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must follow duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't deny that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, getting colder in proportion to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother's heat. <div class="bookquote">``But one may say very true things and apply them
falsely. People can easily take the sacred word duty as a name for what
they desire any one else to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your parent's desire makes no duty for you, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, within reason. But before I give up the happiness of my life--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine, Catherine, it will not be your happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Arrowpoint, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) most raven-like tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what seems to me my happiness--before I give it up, I must see
some better reason than the wish that I should marry a nobleman, or a
man who votes with a party that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be turned into a nobleman. I
feel at liberty to marry the man I love and think worthy, unless some
higher duty forbids.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so it does, Catherine, though you are blinded and cannot see it.
It is a woman's duty not to lower herself. You are lowering yourself.
Mr. Arrowpoint, will you tell your daughter what is her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) duty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must see, Catherine, that Klesmer is not the man for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Arrowpoint. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) won't do at the head of estates. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) has a deuced
foreign look--is an unpractical man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I really can't see what that has to do with it, papa. The land of
England has often passed into the hands of foreigners--Dutch soldiers,
sons of foreign women of bad character:--if our land were sold
to-morrow it would very likely pass into the hands of some foreign
merchant on <div class="bookquote">``Change. It is in everybody's mouth that successful
swindlers may buy up half the land in the country. How can I stem that
tide?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will never do to argue about marriage, Cath,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Arrowpoint.
<div class="bookquote">``It's no use getting up the subject like a parliamentary question. We
must do as other people do. We must think of the nation and the public
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see any public good concerned here, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.
<div class="bookquote">``Why is it to be expected of any heiress that she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) should carry the

to be a ridiculous mishmash of superannuated customs and false

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is mere sophistry, Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint. <div class="bookquote">``Because you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I dare say not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Arrowpoint, with significant scorn.

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine only went into the music-room and said, <div class="bookquote">``Come.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) felt no
need to prepare Klesmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Herr Klesmer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint, with a rather contemptuous
stateliness, <div class="bookquote">``it is unnecessary to repeat what has passed between us
and our daughter. Mr. Arrowpoint will tell you our resolution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your marrying is out of the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Arrowpoint, rather too
heavily weighted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) task, and standing in an embarrassment
unrelieved by a cigar. <div class="bookquote">``It is a wild scheme altogether. A man has been
called out for less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have taken a base advantage of our confidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>burst in Mrs.
Arrowpoint, unable to carry out her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) purpose and leave the burden of
speech to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) husband.

<p/>Klesmer made a low bow in silent irony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The pretension is ridiculous. You had better give it up and leave the
house at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Arrowpoint. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) wished to do without
mentioning the money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give up nothing without reference to your daughter's wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said
Klesmer. <div class="bookquote">``My engagement is to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is useless to discuss the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint. <div class="bookquote">``We
shall never consent to the marriage. If Catherine disobeys us we shall
disinherit her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). You will not marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fortune. It is right you should
know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fortune has been the only thing I have had to regret about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). But I must ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will not think the sacrifice greater
than I am worthy of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no sacrifice to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``except that I am sorry to
hurt my father and mother. I have always felt my fortune to be a
wretched fatality of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to defy us, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to marry Herr Klesmer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, firmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had better not count on our relenting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint, whose
manners suffered from that impunity in insult which has been reckoned
among the privileges of women.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, <div class="bookquote">``certain reasons forbid me to retort. But
understand that I consider it out of the power either of you, or of
your fortune, to confer on me anything that I value. My rank as an
artist is of my own winning, and I would not exchange it for any other.
I am able to maintain your daughter, and I ask for no change in my life
but her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) companionship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will leave the house, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I go at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, bowing and quitting the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let there be no misunderstanding, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``I consider
myself engaged to Herr Klesmer, and I intend to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>The mother turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head away and waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand in sign of dismissal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Arrowpoint, when Catherine was gone;
<div class="bookquote">``but what the deuce are we to do with the property?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is Harry Brendall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brendall</b></font>) can take the name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry Brendall will get through it all in no time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Arrowpoint, relighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) cigar.

<p/>And thus, with nothing settled but the determination of the lovers,
Klesmer had left Quetcham.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIII.

<p/>Among the heirs of Art, as is the division of the promised land, each
has to win his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) portion by hard fighting: the bestowal is after the
manner of prophecy, and is a title without possession. To carry the
map of an ungotten estate in your pocket is a poor sort of copyhold.
And in fancy to cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) shoe over Eden is little warrant that a man
shall ever set the sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foot on an acre of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own there.

<p/>The most obstinate beliefs that mortals entertain about themselves are
such as they have no evidence for beyond a constant, spontaneous
pulsing of their self-satisfaction--as it were a hidden seed of
madness, a confidence that they can move the world without precise
notion of standing-place or lever.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray go to church, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen the next morning. <div class="bookquote">``I prefer
seeing Herr Klesmer alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had written in reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) note that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) at eleven.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is hardly correct, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our affairs are too serious for us to think of such nonsensical
rules,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``They are insulting as well as
ridiculous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not mind Isabel sitting with you? She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) would be reading in a
corner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) could not: she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) would bite her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) nails and stare. It would be too
irritating. Trust my judgment, mamma, I must be alone, Take them all to
church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen had her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) way, of course; only that Miss Merry and two of the
girls stayed at home, to give the house a look of habitation by sitting
at the dining-room windows.

<p/>It was a delicious Sunday morning. The melancholy waning sunshine of
autumn rested on the half-strown grass and came mildly through the
windows in slanting bands of brightness over the old furniture, and the
glass panel that reflected the furniture; over the tapestried chairs
with their faded flower-wreaths, the dark enigmatic pictures, the
superannuated organ at which Gwendolen had pleased herself with acting
Saint Cecelia on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) first joyous arrival, the crowd of pallid, dusty
knicknacks seen through the open doors of the antechamber where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
achieved the wearing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) Greek dress as Hermione. This last memory
was just now very busy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); for had not Klesmer then been struck
with admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pose and expression? Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had said,
whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) to have thought, was at this moment pointed
with keenest interest for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never before in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life
felt so inwardly dependent, so consciously in need of another person's
opinion. There was a new fluttering of spirit within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), a new element
of deliberation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) self-estimate which had hitherto been a blissful
gift of intuition. Still it was the recurrent burden of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) inward
soliloquy that Klesmer had seen but little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and any unfavorable
conclusion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) must have too narrow a foundation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) really felt
clever enough for anything.

<p/>To fill up the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) collected her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) volumes and pieces of music, and
laying them on the top of the piano, set herself to classify them. Then
catching the reflection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) movements in the glass panel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
diverted to the contemplation of the image there and walked toward it.
Dressed in black, without a single ornament, and with the warm
whiteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) skin set off between her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) light-brown coronet of hair
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) square-cut bodice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might have tempted an artist to try
again the Roman trick of a statue in black, white, and tawny marble.
Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) image slowly advancing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought <div class="bookquote">``I _am_ beautiful'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--not
exultingly, but with grave decision. Being beautiful was after all the
condition on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) most needed external testimony. If any one
objected to the turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nose or the form of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck and chin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had not the sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could presently show her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power of attainment
in these branches of feminine perfection.

<p/>There was not much time to fill up in this way before the sound of
wheels, the loud ring, and the opening doors assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
not by any accident to be disappointed. This slightly increased her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
inward flutter. In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) self-confidence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dreaded Klesmer as
part of that unmanageable world which was independent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
wishes--something vitriolic that would not cease to burn because you
smiled or frowned at it. Poor thing! she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was at a higher crisis of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
woman's fate than in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) last experience with Grandcourt. The
questioning then, was whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should take a particular man as a
husband. The inmost fold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) questioning now was whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) need
take a husband at all--whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not achieve substantially for
herself and know gratified ambition without bondage.

<p/>Klesmer made his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) most deferential bow in the wide doorway of the
antechamber--showing also the deference of the finest gray kerseymere
trousers and perfect gloves -LRB-the `masters of those who know' are
happily altogether human-RRB-. Gwendolen met him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) with unusual gravity, and
holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand said, <div class="bookquote">``It is most kind of you to come, Herr
Klesmer. I hope you have not thought me presumptuous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I took your wish as a command that did me honor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, with
answering gravity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) was really putting by his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) own affairs in order to
give his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) utmost attention to what Gwendolen might have to say; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
temperament was still in a state of excitation from the events of
yesterday, likely enough to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) expressions a more than usually
biting edge.

<p/>Gwendolen for once was under too great a strain of feeling to remember
formalities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) continued standing near the piano, and Klesmer took
his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) stand near the other end of it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) back to the light and his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
terribly omniscient eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). No affectation was of use, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
began without delay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to consult you, Herr Klesmer. We have lost all our fortune; we
have nothing. I must get my own bread, and I desire to provide for my
mamma, so as to save her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) from any hardship. The only way I can think
of--and I should like it better than anything--is to be an actress--to
go on the stage. But, of course, I should like to take a high position,
and I thought--if you thought I could'' (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>--here Gwendolen became a little
more nervous--<div class="bookquote">``it would be better for me to be a singer--to study
singing also.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Klesmer put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) hat upon the piano, and folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) arms as if to
concentrate himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen resumed, turning from pale to pink and back
again--<div class="bookquote">``I know that my method of singing is very defective; but I have
been ill taught. I could be better taught; I could study. And you will
understand my wish:--to sing and act too, like Grisi, is a much higher
position. Naturally, I should wish to take as high rank as I can. And I
can rely on your judgment. I am sure you will tell me the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen somehow had the conviction that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) made this serious
appeal the truth would be favorable.

<p/>Still Klesmer did not speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) drew off his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) gloves quickly, tossed
them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) hat, rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) hips, and walked to the
other end of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) was filled with compassion for this girl: he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
wanted to put a guard on his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) speech. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) turned again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with a mild frown of inquiry, and said with gentle though quick
utterance, <div class="bookquote">``You have never seen anything, I think, of artists and their
lives?--I mean of musicians, actors, artists of that kind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, not perturbed by a reference to this obvious
fact in the history of a young lady hitherto well provided for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are--pardon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, again pausing near the piano--<div class="bookquote">``in
coming to a conclusion on such a matter as this, everything must be
taken into consideration--you are perhaps twenty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am twenty-one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, a slight fear rising in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you
think I am too old?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Klesmer pouted his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) under lip and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) long fingers upward in a
manner totally enigmatic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Many persons begin later than others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, betrayed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
habitual consciousness of having valuable information to bestow.

<p/>Klesmer took no notice, but said with more studied gentleness than
ever, <div class="bookquote">``You have probably not thought of an artistic career until now:
you did not entertain the notion, the longing--what shall I say?--you
did not wish yourself an actress, or anything of that sort, till the
present trouble?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly: but I was fond of acting. I have acted; you saw me, if
you remember--you saw me here in charades, and as Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, really fearing that Klesmer had forgotten.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) answered quickly, <div class="bookquote">``I remember--I remember perfectly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and again walked to the other end of the room, It was difficult for him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
to refrain from this kind of movement when he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) was in any argument
either audible or silent.

<p/>Gwendolen felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was being weighed. The delay was unpleasant.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not yet conceive that the scale could dip on the wrong
side, and it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) only graceful to say, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be very much
obliged to you for taking the trouble to give me your advice, whatever
it maybe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Harleth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, turning toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and speaking with a
slight increase of accent, <div class="bookquote">``I will veil nothing from you in this
matter. I should reckon myself guilty if I put a false visage on
things--made them too black or too white. The gods have a curse for him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
who willingly tells another the wrong road. And if I misled one who is
so young, so beautiful--who, I trust, will find her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) happiness along the
right road, I should regard myself as a--_Bösewicht_.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>In the last word
Klesmer's voice had dropped to a loud whisper.

<p/>Gwendolen felt a sinking of heart under this unexpected solemnity, and
kept a sort of fascinated gaze on Klesmer's face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) went on.

<p/>``You are a beautiful young lady--you have been brought up in ease--you
have done what you would--you have not said to yourself, ``I must know
this exactly,'' ``I must understand this exactly,'' ``I must do this
exactly,'''--in uttering these three terrible _musts_, Klesmer lifted up
three long fingers in succession. <div class="bookquote">``In sum, you have not been called
upon to be anything but a charming young lady, whom it is an
impoliteness to find fault with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) paused an instant; then resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) fingers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) hips again, and
thrusting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) powerful chin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, with that preparation, you wish to try the life of an
artist; you wish to try a life of arduous, unceasing work,
and--uncertain praise. Your praise would have to be earned, like your
bread; and both would come slowly, scantily--what do I say?--they may
hardly come at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This tone of discouragement, which Klesmer had hoped might suffice
without anything more unpleasant, roused some resistance in Gwendolen.
With a slight turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>), and an air of pique, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought that you, being an artist, would consider the life one of
the most honorable and delightful. And if I can do nothing better?--I
suppose I can put up with the same risks as other people do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do nothing better?''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, a little fired. <div class="bookquote">``No, my dear Miss
Harleth, you could do nothing better--neither man nor woman could do
anything better--if you could do what was best or good of its kind. I
am not decrying the life of the true artist. I am exalting it. I say,
it is out of the reach of any but choice organizations--natures framed
to love perfection and to labor for it; ready, like all true lovers, to
endure, to wait, to say, I am not yet worthy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--Art, my
mistress--is worthy, and I will live to merit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). An honorable life?
Yes. But the honor comes from the inward vocation and the hard-won
achievement: there is no honor in donning the life as a livery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Some excitement of yesterday had revived in Klesmer and hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
into speech a little aloof from his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) immediate friendly purpose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had
wished as delicately as possible to rouse in Gwendolen a sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
unfitness for a perilous, difficult course; but it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) wont to be
angry with the pretensions of incompetence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) was in danger of
getting chafed. Conscious of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) paused suddenly. But Gwendolen's
chief impression was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had not yet denied her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) the power of doing
what would be good of its kind. Klesmer's fervor seemed to be a sort of
glamor such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) was prone to throw over things in general; and what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) desired to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) of was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not afraid of some
preliminary hardships. The belief that to present herself in public on
the stage must produce an effect such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been used to feel
certain of in private life; was like a bit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) flesh--it was not to
be peeled off readily, but must come with blood and pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, in
a tone of some insistance--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite prepared to bear hardships at first. Of course no one can
become celebrated all at once. And it is not necessary that every one
should be first-rate--either actresses or singers. If you would be so
kind as to tell me what steps I should take, I shall have the courage
to take them. I don't mind going up hill. It will be easier than the
dead level of being a governess. I will take any steps you recommend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Klesmer was convinced now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) must speak plainly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you the steps, not that I recommend, but that will be
forced upon you. It is all one, so far, what your goal will
be--excellence, celebrity, second, third rateness--it is all one. You
must go to town under the protection of your mother. You must put
yourself under training--musical, dramatic, theatrical:--whatever you
desire to do you have to learn'' (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>--here Gwendolen looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were
going to speak, but Klesmer lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) hand and said, decisively, <div class="bookquote">``I
know. You have exercised your talents--you recite--you sing--from the
drawing-room _standpunkt_. My dear Fräulein, you must unlearn all that.
You have not yet conceived what excellence is: you must unlearn your
mistaken admirations. You must know what you have to strive for, and
then you must subdue your mind and body to unbroken discipline. Your
mind, I say. For you must not be thinking of celebrity: put that candle
out of your eyes, and look only at excellence. You would of course earn
nothing--you could get no engagement for a long while. You would need
money for yourself and your family. But that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>here Klesmer frowned and
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) fingers as if to dismiss a triviality, <div class="bookquote">``that could perhaps be
found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen turned pink and pale during this speech. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pride had felt a
terrible knife-edge, and the last sentence only made the smart keener.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was conscious of appearing moved, and tried to escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
weakness by suddenly walking to a seat and pointing out a chair to
Klesmer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) did not take it, but turned a little in order to face her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
and leaned against the piano. At that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
not sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>): this first experience of being taken on some other
ground than that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) social rank and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) beauty was becoming bitter
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Klesmer, preoccupied with a serious purpose, went on without
change of tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what sort of issue might be fairly expected from all this
self-denial? You would ask that. It is right that your eyes should be
open to it. I will tell you truthfully. This issue would be uncertain,
and, most probably, would not be worth much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/>At these relentless words Klesmer put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) lip and looked through
his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) spectacles with the air of a monster impenetrable by beauty.

<p/>Gwendolen's eyes began to burn, but the dread of showing weakness urged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to added self-control. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) compelled herself to say, in a hard
tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think I want talent, or am too old to begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Klesmer made a sort of hum, and then descended on an emphatic ``Yes! The
desire and the training should have begun seven years ago--or a good
deal earlier. A mountebank's child who helps her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) father to earn
shillings when she (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) is six years old--a child that inherits a singing
throat from a long line of choristers and learns to sing as it learns
to talk, has a likelier beginning. Any great achievement in acting or
in music grows with the growth. Whenever an artist has been able to
say, ``I came, I saw, I conquered,<div class="bookquote">'' it has been at the end of patient
practice. Genius at first is little more than a great capacity for
receiving discipline. Singing and acting, like the fine dexterity of
the juggler with his (<font color='blue'><b>juggler</b></font>) cups and balls, require a shaping of the organs
toward a finer and finer certainty of effect. Your muscles--your whole
frame--must go like a watch, true, true to a hair. That is the work of
spring-time, before habits have been determined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not pretend to genius,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, still feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
might somehow do what Klesmer wanted to represent as impossible. <div class="bookquote">``I
only suppose that I might have a little talent--enough to improve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't deny that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer. <div class="bookquote">``If you had been put in the right
track some years ago and had worked well you might now have made a
public singer, though I don't think your voice would have counted for
much in public. For the stage your personal charms and intelligence
might then have told without the present drawback of inexperience--lack
of discipline--lack of instruction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Certainly Klesmer seemed cruel, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) feeling was the reverse of
cruel. Our speech, even when we are most single-minded, can never take
its line absolutely from one impulse; but Klesmer's was, as far as
possible, directed by compassion for poor Gwendolen's ignorant
eagerness to enter on a course of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) saw all the miserable
details with a definiteness which he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) could not if he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) would have
conveyed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind.

<p/>Gwendolen, however, was not convinced. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) self-opinion rallied, and
since the counselor whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had called in gave a decision of such
severe peremptoriness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was tempted to think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) judgment was
not only fallible but biased. It occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that a simpler and
wiser step for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to have taken would have been to send a letter
through the post to the manager of a London theatre, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) to make
an appointment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would make no further reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) singing;
Klesmer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw, had set himself against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) singing. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt
equal to arguing with him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) going on the stage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
answered in a resistant tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understood, of course, that no one can be a finished actress at
once. It may be impossible to tell beforehand whether I should succeed;
but that seems to me a reason why I should try. I should have thought
that I might have taken an engagement at a theatre meanwhile, so as to
earn money and study at the same time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't be done, my dear Miss Harleth--I speak plainly--it can't be
done. I must clear your mind of these notions which have no more
resemblance to reality than a pantomime. Ladies and gentlemen think
that when they have made their toilet and drawn on their gloves they
are as presentable on the stage as in a drawing-room. No manager thinks
that. With all your grace and charm, if you were to present yourself as
an aspirant to the stage, a manager would either require you to pay as
an amateur for being allowed to perform or he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) would tell you to go and
be taught--trained to bear yourself on the stage, as a horse, however
beautiful, must be trained for the circus; to say nothing of that study
which would enable you to personate a character consistently, and
animate it with the natural language of face, gesture, and tone. For
you to get an engagement fit for you straight away is out of the
question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really cannot understand that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, rather
haughtily--then, checking herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) added in another tone--<div class="bookquote">``I shall
be obliged to you if you will explain how it is that such poor
actresses get engaged. I have been to the theatre several times, and I
am sure there were actresses who seemed to me to act not at all well
and who were quite plain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear Miss Harleth, that is the easy criticism of the buyer. We
who buy slippers toss away this pair and the other as clumsy; but there
went an apprenticeship to the making of them. Excuse me; you could not
at present teach one of those actresses; but there is certainly much
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) could teach you. For example, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) can pitch her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) voice so as to
be heard: ten to one you could not do it till after many trials. Merely
to stand and move on the stage is an art--requires practice. It is
understood that we are not now talking of a _comparse_ in a petty
theatre who earns the wages of a needle-woman. That is out of the
question for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I must earn more than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a sense of
wincing rather than of being refuted, <div class="bookquote">``but I think I could soon learn
to do tolerably well all those little things you have mentioned. I am
not so very stupid. And even in Paris, I am sure, I saw two actresses
playing important ladies' parts who were not at all ladies and quite
ugly. I suppose I have no particular talent, but I _must_ think it is
an advantage, even on the stage, to be a lady and not a perfect fright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, let us understand each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, with a flash of new
meaning. <div class="bookquote">``I was speaking of what you would have to go through if you
aimed at becoming a real artist--if you took music and the drama as a
higher vocation in which you would strive after excellence. On that
head, what I have said stands fast. You would find--after your
education in doing things slackly for one-and-twenty years--great
difficulties in study; you would find mortifications in the treatment
you would get when you presented yourself on the footing of skill. You
would be subjected to tests; people would no longer feign not to see
your blunders. You would at first only be accepted on trial. You would
have to bear what I may call a glaring insignificance: any success must
be won by the utmost patience. You would have to keep your place in a
crowd, and after all it is likely you would lose it and get out of
sight. If you determine to face these hardships and still try, you will
have the dignity of a high purpose, even though you may have chosen
unfortunately. You will have some merit, though you may win no prize.
You have asked my judgment on your chances of winning. I don't pretend
to speak absolutely; but measuring probabilities, my judgment is:--you
will hardly achieve more than mediocrity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Klesmer had delivered himself with emphatic rapidity, and now paused a
moment. Gwendolen was motionless, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands, which lay over
each other on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lap, till the deep-toned, long-drawn <div class="bookquote">''_But_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) resumed, had a startling effect, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But--there are certainly other ideas, other dispositions with which a
young lady may take up an art that will bring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) before the public.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may rely on the unquestioned power of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beauty as a passport. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
may desire to exhibit herself to an admiration which dispenses with
skill. This goes a certain way on the stage: not in music: but on the
stage, beauty is taken when there is nothing more commanding to be had.
Not without some drilling, however: as I have said before,
technicalities have in any case to be mastered. But these excepted, we
have here nothing to do with art. The woman who takes up this career is
not an artist: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is usually one who thinks of entering on a luxurious
life by a short and easy road--perhaps by marriage--that is her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) most
brilliant chance, and the rarest. Still, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) career will not be
luxurious to begin with: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can hardly earn her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own poor bread
independently at once, and the indignities she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will be liable to are
such as I will not speak of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I desire to be independent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, deeply stung and
confusedly apprehending some scorn for herself in Klesmer's words.
<div class="bookquote">``That was my reason for asking whether I could not get an immediate
engagement. Of course I cannot know how things go on about theatres.
But I thought that I could have made myself independent. I have no
money, and I will not accept help from any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wounded pride could not rest without making this disclaimer. It was
intolerable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that Klesmer should imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to have expected
other help from him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) than advice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a hard saying for your friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, recovering the
gentleness of tone with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had begun the conversation. <div class="bookquote">``I have
given you pain. That was inevitable. I was bound to put the truth, the
unvarnished truth, before you. I have not said--I will not say--you
will do wrong to choose the hard, climbing path of an endeavoring
artist. You have to compare its difficulties with those of any less
hazardous--any more private course which opens itself to you. If you
take that more courageous resolve I will ask leave to shake hands with
you on the strength of our freemasonry, where we are all vowed to the
service of art, and to serve her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) by helping every fellow-servant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen was silent, again looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt herself very
far away from taking the resolve that would enforce acceptance; and
after waiting an instant or two, Klesmer went on with deepened
seriousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where there is the duty of service there must be the duty of accepting
it. The question is not one of personal obligation. And in relation to
practical matters immediately affecting your future--excuse my
permitting myself to mention in confidence an affair of my own. I am
expecting an event which would make it easy for me to exert myself on
your behalf in furthering your opportunities of instruction and
residence in London--under the care, that is, of your family--without
need for anxiety on your part. If you resolve to take art as a
bread-study, you need only undertake the study at first; the bread will
be found without trouble. The event I mean is my marriage--in fact--you
will receive this as a matter of confidence--my marriage with Miss
Arrowpoint, which will more than double such right as I have to be
trusted by you as a friend. Your friendship will have greatly risen in
value for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>)_ by your having adopted that generous labor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen's face had begun to burn. That Klesmer was about to marry
Miss Arrowpoint caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) no surprise, and at another moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would
have amused herself in quickly imagining the scenes that must have
occurred at Quetcham. But what engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feeling, what filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
imagination now, was the panorama of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own immediate future that
Klesmer's words seemed to have unfolded. The suggestion of Miss
Arrowpoint as a patroness was only another detail added to its
repulsiveness: Klesmer's proposal to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seemed an additional
irritation after the humiliating judgment he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had passed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
capabilities. His (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) words had really bitten into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) self-confidence and
turned it into the pain of a bleeding wound; and the idea of presenting
herself before other judges was now poisoned with the dread that they
also might be harsh; they also would not recognize the talent she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
conscious of. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) controlled herself, and rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seat before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) made any answer. It seemed natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should pause. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went
to the piano and looked absently at leaves of music, pinching up the
corners. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned toward Klesmer and said, with almost her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
usual air of proud equality, which in this interview had not been
hitherto perceptible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I congratulate you sincerely, Herr Klesmer. I think I never saw any
one so admirable as Miss Arrowpoint. And I have to thank you for every
sort of kindness this morning. But I can't decide now. If I make the
resolve you have spoken of, I will use your permission--I will let you
know. But I fear the obstacles are too great. In any case, I am deeply
obliged to you. It was very bold of me to ask you to take this trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Klesmer's inward remark was, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will never let me know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>But with the
most thorough respect in his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Command me at any time.
There is an address on this card which will always find me with little
delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) hat and was going to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) bow, Gwendolen's
better self, conscious of an ingratitude which the clear-seeing Klesmer
must have penetrated, made a desperate effort to find its way above the
stifling layers of egoistic disappointment and irritation. Looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) with a glance of the old gayety, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand, and said
with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``If I take the wrong road, it will not be because of your
flattery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God forbid that you should take any road but one where you will find
and give happiness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, fervently. Then, in foreign fashion,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fingers lightly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) lips, and in another minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
heard the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) departing wheels getting more distant on the
gravel.

<p/>Gwendolen had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life felt so miserable. No sob came, no
passion of tears, to relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes were burning; and the
noonday only brought into more dreary clearness the absence of interest
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life. All memories, all objects, the pieces of music
displayed, the open piano--the very reflection of herself in the
glass--seemed no better than the packed-up shows of a departing fair.
For the first time since her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consciousness began, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was having a
vision of herself on the common level, and had lost the innate sense
that there were reasons why she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should not be slighted, elbowed,
jostled--treated like a passenger with a third-class ticket, in spite
of private objections on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own part. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not move about; the
prospects begotten by disappointment were too oppressively
preoccupying; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) threw herself into the shadiest corner of a settee,
and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fingers over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) burning eyelids. Every word that
Klesmer had said seemed to have been branded into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) memory, as most
words are which bring with them a new set of impressions and make an
epoch for us. Only a few hours before, the dawning smile of
self-contentment rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) vaguely imagined a future
suited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wishes: it seemed but the affair of a year or so for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
to become the most approved Juliet of the time: or, if Klesmer
encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) idea of being a singer, to proceed by more gradual steps
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) place in the opera, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) won money and applause by
occasional performances. Why not? At home, at school, among
acquaintances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been used to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) conscious superiority
admitted; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had moved in a society where everything, from low
arithmetic to high art, is of the amateur kind, politely supposed to
fall short of perfection only because gentlemen and ladies are not
obliged to do more than they like--otherwise they would probably give
forth abler writings, and show themselves more commanding artists than
any the world is at present obliged to put up with. The self-confident
visions that had beguiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were not of a highly exceptional kind;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had at least shown some rationality in consulting the person
who knew the most and had flattered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) the least. In asking Klesmer's
advice, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had rather been borne up by a belief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) latent
admiration than bent on knowing anything more unfavorable that might
have lain behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) slight objections to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) singing; and the truth
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had asked for, with an expectation that it would be agreeable, had
come like a lacerating thong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too old--should have begun seven years ago--you will not, at best,
achieve more than mediocrity--hard, incessant work, uncertain
praise--bread coming slowly, scantily, perhaps not at
all--mortifications, people no longer feigning not to see your
blunders--glaring insignificance'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--all these phrases rankled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>);
and even more galling was the hint that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could only be accepted on
the stage as a beauty who hoped to get a husband. The <div class="bookquote">``indignities''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might be visited with had no very definite form for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), but
the mere association of anything called <div class="bookquote">``indignity''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>with herself,
roused a resentful alarm. And along with the vaguer images which were
raised by those biting words, came the precise conception of
disagreeables which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) experience enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to imagine. How could
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma and the four sisters to London? if it were not
possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to earn money at once? And as for submitting to be a
_protégé_, and asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma to submit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to the humiliation
of being supported by Miss Arrowpoint--that was as bad as being a
governess; nay, worse; for suppose the end of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) study to be as
worthless as Klesmer clearly expected it to be, the sense of favors
received and never repaid, would embitter the miseries of
disappointment. Klesmer doubtless had magnificent ideas about helping
artists; but how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) know the feelings of ladies in such matters?
It was all over: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had entertained a mistaken hope; and there was an
end of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An end of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, aloud, starting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
heard the steps and voices of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma and sisters coming in from
church. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hurried to the piano and began gathering together her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
pieces of music with assumed diligence, while the expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
pale face and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) burning eyes was what would have suited a woman
enduring a wrong which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might not resent, but would probably revenge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said gentle Mrs. Davilow, entering, <div class="bookquote">``I see by the
wheel-marks that Klesmer has been here. Have you been satisfied with
the interview?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had some guesses as to its object, but felt timid
about implying them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Satisfied, mamma? oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a high, hard tone, for
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) must be excused, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dreaded a scene of emotion. If
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not set herself resolutely to feign proud indifference, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) must fall into a passionate outburst of despair, which
would cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma more deeply than all the rest of their calamities.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your uncle and aunt were disappointed at not seeing you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Davilow, coming near the piano, and watching Gwendolen's movements. <div class="bookquote">``I
only said that you wanted rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in the same tone, turning to put
away some music.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I not to know anything now, Gwendolen? Am I always to be in the
dark?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, too keenly sensitive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) daughter's manner
and expression not to fear that something painful had occurred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is really nothing to tell now, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a
still higher voice. <div class="bookquote">``I had a mistaken idea about something I could do.
Herr Klesmer has undeceived me. That is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't look and speak in that way, my dear child: I cannot bear it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, breaking down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) felt an undefinable terror.

<p/>Gwendolen looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) a moment in silence, biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) inner lip; then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's shoulders,
said, with a drop in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) voice to the lowest undertone, <div class="bookquote">``Mamma, don't
speak to me now. It is useless to cry and waste our strength over what
can't be altered. You will live at Sawyer's Cottage, and I am going to
the bishop's daughters. There is no more to be said. Things cannot be
altered, and who cares? It makes no difference to any one else what we
do. We must try not to care ourselves. We must not give way. I dread
giving way. Help me to be quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow was like a frightened child under her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) daughter's face and
voice; her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) tears were arrested and she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) went away in silence.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I question things but do not find
One that will answer to my mind:
And all the world appears unkind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>WORDSWORTH</b></font>)</div>--WORDSWORTH.


<p/>Gwendolen was glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had got through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) interview with Klesmer
before meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle and aunt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind now that
there were only disagreeables before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt able to maintain
a dogged calm in the face of any humiliation that might be proposed.

<p/>The meeting did not happen until the Monday, when Gwendolen went to the
rectory with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma. They had called at Sawyer's Cottage by the way,
and had seen every cranny of the narrow rooms in a mid-day light,
unsoftened by blinds and curtains; for the furnishing to be done by
gleanings from the rectory had not yet begun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How _shall_ you endure it, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, as they walked
away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips while they were looking round at the
bare walls and floors, and the little garden with the cabbage-stalks,
and the yew arbor all dust and cobwebs within. <div class="bookquote">``You and the four girls
all in that closet of a room, with the green and yellow paper pressing
on your eyes? And without me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be some comfort that you have not to bear it too, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it were not that I must get some money, I would rather be there
than go to be a governess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't set yourself against it beforehand, Gwendolen. If you go to the
palace you will have every luxury about you. And you know how much you
have always cared for that. You will not find it so hard as going up
and down those steep narrow stairs, and hearing the crockery rattle
through the house, and the dear girls talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is like a bad dream,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, impetuously. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot
believe that my uncle will let you go to such a place. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) ought to have
taken some other steps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be unreasonable, dear child. What could he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) have done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was for him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to find out. It seems to me a very extraordinary
world if people in our position must sink in this way all at once,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, the other worlds with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was conversant being
constructed with a sense of fitness that arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own future
agreeably.

<p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) temper that framed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sentences under this entirely new
pressure of evils: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could have spoken more suitably on the
vicissitudes in other people's lives, though it was never her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
aspiration to express herself virtuously so much as cleverly--a point
to be remembered in extenuation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) words, which were usually worse
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was.

<p/>And, notwithstanding the keen sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own bruises, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was capable
of some compunction when her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle and aunt received her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with a more
affectionate kindness than they had ever shown before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not
but be struck by the dignified cheerfulness with which they talked of
the necessary economies in their way of living, and in the education of
the boys. Mr. Gascoigne's worth of character, a little obscured by
worldly opportunities--as the poetic beauty of women is obscured by the
demands of fashionable dressing--showed itself to great advantage under
this sudden reduction of fortune. Prompt and methodical, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) had set
himself not only to put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) carriage, but to reconsider his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) worn
suits of clothes, to leave off meat for breakfast, to do without
periodicals, to get Edwy from school and arrange hours of study for all
the boys under himself, and to order the whole establishment on the
sparest footing possible. For all healthy people economy has its
pleasures; and the rector's spirit had spread through the household.
Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna, who always made papa their model, really did
not miss anything they cared about for themselves, and in all sincerity
felt that the saddest part of the family losses was the change for Mrs.
Davilow and her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) children.

<p/>Anna for the first time could merge her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) resentment on behalf of Rex in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sympathy with Gwendolen; and Mrs. Gascoigne was disposed to hope
that trouble would have a salutary effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) niece, without
thinking it her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) duty to add any bitters by way of increasing the
salutariness. They had both been busy devising how to get blinds and
curtains for the cottage out of the household stores; but with delicate
feeling they left these matters in the back-ground, and talked at first
of Gwendolen's journey, and the comfort it was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
at home again.

<p/>In fact there was nothing for Gwendolen to take as a justification for
extending her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) discontent with events to the persons immediately around
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt shaken into a more alert attention, as if by a call
to drill that everybody else was obeying, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle began in a
voice of firm kindness to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) of the efforts he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had been making
to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) a situation which would offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as many advantages as
possible. Mr. Gascoigne had not forgotten Grandcourt, but the
possibility of further advances from that quarter was something too
vague for a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good sense to be determined by it: uncertainties
of that kind must not now slacken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) action in doing the best he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) niece under actual conditions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt that there was no time to be lost, Gwendolen; for a position in
a good family where you will have some consideration is not to be had
at a moment's notice. And however long we waited we could hardly find
one where you would be better off than at Bishop Mompert's. I am known
to both him (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) and Mrs. Mompert, and that of course is an advantage to
you. Our correspondence has gone on favorably; but I cannot be
surprised that Mrs. Mompert wishes to see you before making an absolute
engagement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) thinks of arranging for you to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) at Wanchester
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) is on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) way to town. I dare say you will feel the interview
rather trying for you, my dear; but you will have a little time to
prepare your mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know _why_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) wants to see me, uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, whose
mind had quickly gone over various reasons that an imaginary Mrs.
Mompert with three daughters might be supposed to entertain, reasons
all of a disagreeable kind to the person presenting herself for
inspection.

<p/>The rector smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be alarmed, my dear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) would like to have a
more precise idea of you than my report can give. And a mother is
naturally scrupulous about a companion for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughters. I have told
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) you are very young. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) herself exercises a close supervision
over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughters' education, and that makes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) less anxious as to
age. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is a woman of taste and also of strict principle, and objects
to having a French person in the house. I feel sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will think
your manners and accomplishments as good as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is likely to find; and
over the religious and moral tone of the education she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and indeed the
bishop himself, will preside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen dared not answer, but the repression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) decided dislike
to the whole prospect sent an unusually deep flush over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face and
neck, subsiding as quickly as it came. Anna, full of tender fears, put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) little hand into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cousin's, and Mr. Gascoigne was too kind a man
not to conceive something of the trial which this sudden change must be
for a girl like Gwendolen. Bent on giving a cheerful view of things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bent</b></font>)
went on, in an easy tone of remark, not as if answering supposed
objections--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so highly of the position, that I should have been tempted to
try and get it for Anna, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been at all likely to meet Mrs.
Mompert's wants. It is really a home, with a continuance of education
in the highest sense: `governess' is a misnomer. The bishop's views are
of a more decidedly Low Church color than my own--he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is a close friend
of Lord Grampian's; but, though privately strict, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is not by any
means narrow in public matters. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) has created as little
dislike in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) diocese as any bishop on the bench. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) has always
remained friendly to me, though before his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) promotion, when he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was an
incumbent of this diocese, we had a little controversy about the Bible
Society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The rector's words were too pregnant with satisfactory meaning to
himself for him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) to imagine the effect they produced in the mind of his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>)
niece. <div class="bookquote">``Continuance of education'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``bishop's views'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``privately
strict'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Bible Society,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) had introduced a few snakes
at large for the instruction of ladies who regarded them as all alike
furnished with poison-bags, and, biting or stinging, according to
convenience. To Gwendolen, already shrinking from the prospect open to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), such phrases came like the growing heat of a burning glass--not at
all as the links of persuasive reflection which they formed for the
good uncle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began, desperately, to seek an alternative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was another situation, I think, mamma spoke of?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, with
determined self-mastery.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>said the rector, in rather a depreciatory tone; <div class="bookquote">``but that is in
a school. I should not have the same satisfaction in your taking that.
It would be much harder work, you are aware, and not so good in any
other respect. Besides, you have not an equal chance of getting it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne, <div class="bookquote">``it would be much less appropriate,
You might not have a bedroom to yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>And Gwendolen's memories of
school suggested other particulars which forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) to admit to herself
that this alternative would be no relief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) uncle again
and said, apparently in acceptance of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) ideas--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When is Mrs. Mompert likely to send for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is rather uncertain, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) has promised not to entertain any
other proposal till she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) has seen you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) has entered with much feeling
into your position. It will be within the next fortnight, probably. But
I must be off now. I am going to let part of my glebe uncommonly well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The rector</b></font>)</div><p/>The rector ended very cheerfully, leaving the room with the
satisfactory conviction that Gwendolen was going to adapt herself to
circumstances like a girl of good sense. Having spoken appropriately,
he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) naturally supposed that the effects would be appropriate; being
accustomed, as a household and parish authority, to be asked to <div class="bookquote">``speak
to''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>refractory persons, with the understanding that the measure was
morally coercive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a stay Henry is to us all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) husband
had left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, cordially. <div class="bookquote">``I think cheerfulness is
a fortune in itself. I wish I had it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Rex is just like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne. <div class="bookquote">``I must tell you the
comfort we have had in a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>). I must read you a little
bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) added, taking the letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) pocket, while Anna looked
rather frightened--she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not know why, except that it had been a rule
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) not to mention Rex before Gwendolen.

<p/>The proud mother ran her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes over the letter, seeking for sentences to
read aloud. But apparently she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had found it sown with what might seem
to be closer allusions than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) desired to the recent past, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
looked up, folding the letter, and saying--

<p/>``However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) tells us that our trouble has made a man of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) sees a
reason for any amount of work: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) means to get a fellowship, to take
pupils, to set one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) brothers going, to be everything that is most
remarkable. The letter is full of fun--just like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) says, ``Tell
mother she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has put out an advertisement for a jolly good hard-working
son, in time to hinder me from taking ship; and I offer myself for the
place.<div class="bookquote">'' The letter came on Friday. I never saw my husband so much moved
by anything since Rex was born. It seemed a gain to balance our loss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>This letter, in fact, was what had helped both Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna
to show Gwendolen an unmixed kindliness; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) herself felt very
amiably about it, smiling at Anna, and pinching her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) chin, as much as to
say, <div class="bookquote">``Nothing is wrong with you now, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had no gratuitously
ill-natured feeling, or egoistic pleasure in making men miserable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
only had an intense objection to their making her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) miserable.

<p/>But when the talk turned on furniture for the cottage Gwendolen was not
roused to show even a languid interest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had done
as much as could be expected of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) this morning, and indeed felt at an
heroic pitch in keeping to herself the struggle that was going on
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). The recoil of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind from the only definite prospect
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), was stronger than even she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had imagined beforehand. The
idea of presenting herself before Mrs. Mompert in the first instance,
to be approved or disapproved, came as pressure on an already painful
bruise; even as a governess, it appeared she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) was to be tested and was
liable to rejection. After she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) had done herself the violence to accept
the bishop and his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) wife, they were still to consider whether they would
accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>); it was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) peril that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) was to look, speak, or be
silent. And even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) had entered on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) dismal task of
self-constraint in the society of three girls whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) was bound
incessantly to edify, the same process of inspection was to go on:
there was always to be Mrs. Mompert's supervision; always something or
other would be expected of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) had not the slightest
inclination; and perhaps the bishop would examine her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) on serious
topics. Gwendolen, lately used to the social successes of a handsome
girl, whose lively venturesomeness of talk has the effect of wit, and
who six weeks before would have pitied the dullness of the bishop
rather than have been embarrassed by him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), saw the life before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as an
entrance into a penitentiary. Wild thoughts of running away to be an
actress, in spite of Klesmer, came to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with the lure of freedom; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) words still hung heavily on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soul; they had alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pride
and even her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) maidenly dignity: dimly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) conceived herself getting
amongst vulgar people who would treat her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with rude familiarity--odious
men, whose grins and smirks would not be seen through the strong
grating of polite society. Gwendolen's daring was not in the least that
of the adventuress; the demand to be held a lady was in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very
marrow; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had dreamed that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might be the heroine of the
gaming-table, it was with the understanding that no one should treat
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with the less consideration, or presume to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with irony
as Deronda had done. To be protected and petted, and to have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
susceptibilities consulted in every detail, had gone along with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
food and clothing as matters of course in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life: even without any
such warning as Klesmer's she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not have thought it an attractive
freedom to be thrown in solitary dependence on the doubtful civility of
strangers. The endurance of the episcopal penitentiary was less
repulsive than that; though here too she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would certainly never be
petted or have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) susceptibilities consulted. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rebellion against
this hard necessity which had come just to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) of all people in the
world--to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whom all circumstances had concurred in preparing for
something quite different--was exaggerated instead of diminished as one
hour followed another, with the imagination of what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might have
expected in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lot and what it was actually to be. The family
troubles, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought, were easier for every one than for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--even for
poor dear mamma, because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had always used herself to not enjoying.
As to hoping that if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went to the Momperts' and was patient a little
while, things might get better--it would be stupid to entertain hopes
for herself after all that had happened: her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) talents, it appeared,
would never be recognized as anything remarkable, and there was not a
single direction in which probability seemed to flatter her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wishes.
Some beautiful girls who, like her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), had read romances where even plain
governesses are centres of attraction and are sought in marriage, might
have solaced themselves a little by transporting such pictures into
their own future; but even if Gwendolen's experience had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to
dwell on love-making and marriage as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) elysium, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart was too
much oppressed by what was near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), in both the past and the
future, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to project her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) anticipations very far off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a
world-nausea upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and saw no reason all through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life why she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
should wish to live. No religious view of trouble helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
troubles had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) opinion all been caused by other people's
disagreeable or wicked conduct; and there was really nothing pleasant
to be counted on in the world: that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feeling; everything else
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had heard said about trouble was mere phrase-making not attractive
enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to have caught it up and repeated it. As to the
sweetness of labor and fulfilled claims; the interest of inward and
outward activity; the impersonal delights of life as a perpetual
discovery; the dues of courage, fortitude, industry, which it is mere
baseness not to pay toward the common burden; the supreme worth of the
teacher's vocation;--these, even if they had been eloquently preached
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), could have been no more than faintly apprehended doctrines: the
fact which wrought upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) invariable observation that for a
lady to become a governess--to <div class="bookquote">``take a situation'' (<font color='red'><b>a governess</b></font>)</div>--was to descend in
life and to be treated at best with a compassionate patronage. And poor
Gwendolen had never dissociated happiness from personal pre-eminence
and _éclat_. That where these threatened to forsake her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should
take life to be hardly worth the having, cannot make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) so unlike the
rest of us, men or women, that we should cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) out of our
compassion; our moments of temptation to a mean opinion of things in
general being usually dependent on some susceptibility about ourselves
and some dullness to subjects which every one else would consider more
important. Surely a young creature is pitiable who has the labyrinth of
life before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and no clue--to whom distrust in herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) good
fortune has come as a sudden shock, like a rent across the path that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was treading carelessly.

<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) healthy frame, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) irreconcilable repugnance affected
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) even physically; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt a sort of numbness and could set about
nothing; the least urgency, even that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meals, was an
irritation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); the speech of others on any subject seemed
unreasonable, because it did not include her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feeling and was an
ignorant claim on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). It was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nature to busy herself with
the fancies of suicide to which disappointed young people are prone:
what occupied and exasperated her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was the sense that there was nothing
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) but to live in a way she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) avoided going to the
rectory again: it was too intolerable to have to look and talk as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were compliant; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not exert herself to show interest
about the furniture of that horrible cottage. Miss Merry was staying on
purpose to help, and such people as Jocosa liked that sort of thing.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) mother had to make excuses for her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) not appearing, even when Anna
came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). For that calm which Gwendolen had promised herself to
maintain had changed into sick motivelessness: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose
I shall begin to pretend by-and-by, but why should I do it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with silent distress; and, lapsing into the
habit of indulgent tenderness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began to think what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagined
that Gwendolen was thinking, and to wish that everything should give
way to the possibility of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) darling less miserable.

<p/>One day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was in the black and yellow bedroom and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother was
lingering there under the pretext of considering and arranging
Gwendolen's articles of dress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) suddenly roused herself to fetch the
casket which contained the ornaments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began, glancing over the upper layer, <div class="bookquote">``I had forgotten
these things. Why didn't you remind me of them? Do see about getting
them sold. You will not mind about parting with them. You gave them all
to me long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lifted the upper tray and looked below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we can do without them, darling, I would rather keep them for you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, seating herself beside Gwendolen with a feeling of
relief that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was beginning to talk about something. The usual
relation between them had become reversed. It was now the mother who
tried to cheer the daughter. <div class="bookquote">``Why, how came you to put that pocket
handkerchief in here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the handkerchief with the corner torn off which Gwendolen had
thrust in with the turquoise necklace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It happened to be with the necklace--I was in a hurry.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, taking the handkerchief away and putting it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pocket.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't sell the necklace, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) added, a new feeling having come
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) about that rescue of it which had formerly been so offensive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, no; it was made out of your dear father's chain. And I
should prefer not selling the other things. None of them are of any
great value. All my best ornaments were taken from me long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow colored. She (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) usually avoided any reference to such facts
about Gwendolen's step-father as that he (<font color='blue'><b>step-father</b></font>) had carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>step-father</b></font>) wife's
jewelry and disposed of it. After a moment's pause she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And these things have not been reckoned on for any expenses. Carry
them with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be quite useless, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, coldly.
<div class="bookquote">``Governesses don't wear ornaments. You had better get me a gray frieze
livery and a straw poke, such as my aunt's charity children wear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, no; don't take that view of it. I feel sure the Momperts
will like you the better for being graceful and elegant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all sure what the Momperts will like me to be. It is
enough that I am expected to be what they like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen
bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there is anything you would object to less--anything that could be
done--instead of your going to the bishop's, do say so, Gwendolen. Tell
me what is in your heart. I will try for anything you wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the
mother, beseechingly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't keep things away from me. Let us bear them
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, there is nothing to tell. I can't do anything better. I
must think myself fortunate if they will have me. I shall get some
money for you. That is the only thing I have to think of. I shall not
spend any money this year: you will have all the eighty pounds. I don't
know how far that will go in housekeeping; but you need not stitch your
poor fingers to the bone, and stare away all the sight that the tears
have left in your dear eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen did not give any caresses with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) words as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been used
to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not even look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, but was looking at the
turquoise necklace as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned it over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you for your tenderness, my good darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow,
with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Don't despair because there are clouds now.
You are so young. There may be great happiness in store for you yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see any reason for expecting it, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a
hard tone; and Mrs. Davilow was silent, thinking as she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had often
thought before--<div class="bookquote">``What did happen between her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and Mr. Grandcourt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _will_ keep this necklace, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, laying it apart
and then closing the casket. <div class="bookquote">``But do get the other things sold, even if
they will not bring much. Ask my uncle what to do with them. I shall
certainly not use them again. I am going to take the veil. I wonder if
all the poor wretches who have ever taken it felt as I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't exaggerate evils, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can any one know that I exaggerate, when I am speaking of my own
feeling? I did not say what any one else felt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) took out the torn handkerchief from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pocket again, and wrapped
it deliberately round the necklace. Mrs. Davilow observed the action
with some surprise, but the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) last words discouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) from
asking any question.

<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``feeling''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen spoke of with an air of tragedy was not to be
explained by the mere fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was going to be a governess: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was possessed by a spirit of general disappointment. It was not simply
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a distaste for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was called on to do: the distaste
spread itself over the world outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) penitentiary, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw
nothing very pleasant in it that seemed attainable by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
were free. Naturally her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) grievances did not seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) smaller than
some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) male contemporaries held theirs to be when they felt a
profession too narrow for their powers, and had an _à priori_
conviction that it was not worth while to put forth their latent
abilities. Because her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) education had been less expensive than theirs,
it did not follow that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should have wider emotions or a keener
intellectual vision. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) griefs were feminine; but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as a woman
they were not the less hard to bear, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt an equal right to the
Promethean tone.

<p/>But the movement of mind which led her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to keep the necklace, to fold it
up in the handkerchief, and rise to put it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) _nécessaire_, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had first placed it when it had been returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), was more
peculiar, and what would be called less reasonable. It came from that
streak of superstition in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) which attached itself both to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
confidence and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) terror--a superstition which lingers in an intense
personality even in spite of theory and science; any dread or hope for
self being stronger than all reasons for or against it. Why she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should
suddenly determine not to part with the necklace was not much clearer
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) than why she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should sometimes have been frightened to find
herself in the fields alone: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a confused state of emotion about
Deronda--was it wounded pride and resentment, or a certain awe and
exceptional trust? It was something vague and yet mastering, which
impelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to this action about the necklace. There is a great deal
of unmapped country within us which would have to be taken into account
in an explanation of our gusts and storms.




<p/>CHAPTER XXV.

<p/>How trace the why and wherefore in a mind reduced to the barrenness of
a fastidious egoism, in which all direct desires are dulled, and have
dwindled from motives into a vacillating expectation of motives: a
mind made up of moods, where a fitful impulse springs here and there
conspicuously rank amid the general weediness? ``Tis a condition apt to
befall a life too much at large, unmoulded by the pressure of
obligation. _Nam deteriores omnes sumus licentiae_, or, as a more
familiar tongue might deliver it, _<div class="bookquote">``As you like''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is a bad finger-post._


<p/>Potentates make known their intentions and affect the funds at a small
expense of words. So when Grandcourt, after learning that Gwendolen had
left Leubronn, incidentally pronounced that resort of fashion a beastly
hole, worse than Baden, the remark was conclusive to Mr. Lush that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>)
patron intended straightway to return to Diplow. The execution was sure
to be slower than the intention, and, in fact, Grandcourt did loiter
through the next day without giving any distinct orders about
departure--perhaps because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) discerned that Lush was expecting them:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) lingered over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) toilet, and certainly came down with a faded
aspect of perfect distinction which made fresh complexions and hands
with the blood in them, seem signs of raw vulgarity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) lingered on the
terrace, in the gambling-rooms, in the reading-room, occupying himself
in being indifferent to everybody and everything around him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>)
met Lady Mallinger, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) took some trouble--raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) hat,
paused, and proved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) recommendation of the waters
by replying, <div class="bookquote">``Yes; I heard somebody say how providential it was that
there always happened to be springs at gambling places.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that was a joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said innocent Lady Mallinger, misled by
Grandcourt's languid seriousness, <div class="bookquote">``in imitation of the old one about
the towns and the rivers, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, without change of expression. Lady
Mallinger thought this worth telling to Sir Hugo, who said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my
dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) is not a fool. You must not suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) can't see a joke.
He (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) can play his (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) cards as well as most of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) has never seemed to me a very sensible man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Lady Mallinger,
in excuse of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) had a secret objection to meeting Grandcourt,
who was little else to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) than a large living sign of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) felt to
be her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) failure as a wife--the not having presented Sir Hugo with a son.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) constant reflection was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) husband might fairly regret his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
choice, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not been very good might have treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) with
some roughness in consequence, gentlemen naturally disliking to be
disappointed.

<p/>Deronda, too, had a recognition from Grandcourt, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not
grateful, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) took care to return it with perfect civility. No
reasoning as to the foundations of custom could do away with the
early-rooted feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) birth had been attended with injury for
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) father was to blame; and seeing that but for this injury
Grandcourt's prospects might have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was proudly resolute not
to behave in any way that might be interpreted into irritation on that
score. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) saw a very easy descent into mean unreasoning rancor and
triumph in others' frustration; and being determined not to go down
that ugly pit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) back on it, clinging to the kindlier
affections within him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) as a possession. Pride certainly helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
well--the pride of not recognizing a disadvantage for one's self which
vulgar minds are disposed to exaggerate, such as the shabby equipage of
poverty: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would not have a man like Grandcourt suppose himself envied
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). But there is no guarding against interpretation. Grandcourt did
believe that Deronda, poor devil, who he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had no doubt was his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) cousin by
the father's side, inwardly winced under their mutual position;
wherefore the presence of that less lucky person was more agreeable to
him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) than it would otherwise have been. An imaginary envy, the idea that
others feel their comparative deficiency, is the ordinary _cortège_ of
egoism; and his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) pet dogs were not the only beings that Grandcourt liked
to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) power over in making them jealous. Hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was civil
enough to exchange several words with Deronda on the terrace about the
hunting round Diplow, and even said, <div class="bookquote">``You had better come over for a
run or two when the season begins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Lush, not displeased with delay, amused himself very well, partly in
gossiping with Sir Hugo and in answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) questions about
Grandcourt's affairs so far as they might affect his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) willingness to
part with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) interest in Diplow. Also about Grandcourt's personal
entanglements, the baronet knew enough already for Lush to feel
released from silence on a sunny autumn day, when there was nothing
more agreeable to do in lounging promenades than to speak freely of a
tyrannous patron behind his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) back. Sir Hugo willingly inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) ear
to a little good-humored scandal, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was fond of calling _traits
de moeurs_; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was strict in keeping such communications from
hearers who might take them too seriously. Whatever knowledge he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) nephew's secrets, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had never spoken of it to Deronda, who
considered Grandcourt a pale-blooded mortal, but was far from wishing
to hear how the red corpuscles had been washed out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). It was
Lush's policy and inclination to gratify everybody when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had no
reason to the contrary; and the baronet always treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) well, as one
of those easy-handled personages who, frequenting the society of
gentlemen, without being exactly gentlemen themselves, can be the more
serviceable, like the second-best articles of our wardrobe, which we
use with a comfortable freedom from anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you will let me know the turn of events,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, <div class="bookquote">``if
this marriage seems likely to come off after all, or if anything else
happens to make the want of money pressing. My plan would be much
better for him (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) than burdening Ryelands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lush/Lush</b></font>)</div>said Lush, <div class="bookquote">``only it must not be urged on him (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>)--just
placed in his (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) way that the scent may tickle him (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>). Grandcourt is not a
man to be always led by what makes for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own interest; especially if
you let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) see that it makes for your interest too. I'm attached to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), of course. I've given up everything else for the sake of keeping
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and it has lasted a good fifteen years now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would not easily
get any one else to fill my place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)'s a peculiar character, is
Henleigh Grandcourt, and it has been growing on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) of late years.
However, I'm of a constant disposition, and I've been a sort of
guardian to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was twenty; an uncommonly fascinating fellow
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was then, to be sure--and could be now, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) liked. I'm attached to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>); and it would be a good deal worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) missed me at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
elbow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lush/Lush</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Hugo did not think it needful to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) sympathy or even
assent, and perhaps Lush himself did not expect this sketch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
motives to be taken as exact. But how can a man avoid himself as a
subject in conversation? And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must make some sort of decent toilet in
words, as in cloth and linen. Lush's listener was not severe: a member
of Parliament could allow for the necessities of verbal toilet; and the
dialogue went on without any change of mutual estimate.

<p/>However, Lush's easy prospect of indefinite procrastination was cut off
the next morning by Grandcourt's saluting him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) with the question--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you making all the arrangements for our starting by the Paris
train?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know you meant to start,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Lush, not exactly taken by
surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might have known,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, looking at the burned length
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cigar, and speaking in that lowered tone which was usual with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) meant to express disgust and be peremptory. <div class="bookquote">``Just see to
everything, will you? and mind no brute gets into the same carriage
with us. And leave my P. P. C. at the Mallingers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In consequence they were at Paris the next day; but here Lush was
gratified by the proposal or command that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) should go straight on to
Diplow and see that everything was right, while Grandcourt and the
valet remained behind; and it was not until several days later that
Lush received the telegram ordering the carriage to the Wanchester
station.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) had used the interim actively, not only in carrying out Grandcourt's
orders about the stud and household, but in learning all he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could of
Gwendolen, and how things were going on at Offendene. What was the
probable effect that the news of the family misfortunes would have on
Grandcourt's fitful obstinacy he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) felt to be quite incalculable. So far
as the girl's poverty might be an argument that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would accept an
offer from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) now in spite of any previous coyness, it might remove
that bitter objection to risk a repulse which Lush divined to be one of
Grandcourt's deterring motives; on the other hand, the certainty of
acceptance was just <div class="bookquote">``the sort of thing''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lapse hither and
thither with no more apparent will than a moth. Lush had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) patron
under close observation for many years, and knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) perhaps better
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knew any other subject; but to know Grandcourt was to doubt
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would do in any particular case. It might happen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would
behave with an apparent magnanimity, like the hero of a modern French
drama, whose sudden start into moral splendor after much lying and
meanness, leaves you little confidence as to any part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) career
that may follow the fall of the curtain. Indeed, what attitude would
have been more honorable for a final scene than that of declining to
seek an heiress for her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) money, and determining to marry the attractive
girl who had none? But Lush had some general certainties about
Grandcourt, and one was that of all inward movements those of
generosity were least likely to occur in him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). Of what use, however, is
a general certainty that an insect will not walk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) head
hindmost, when what you need to know is the play of inward stimulus
that sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hither and thither in a network of possible paths? Thus
Lush was much at fault as to the probable issue between Grandcourt and
Gwendolen, when what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) desired was a perfect confidence that they
would never be married. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would have consented willingly that
Grandcourt should marry an heiress, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should marry Mrs.
Glasher: in the one match there would have been the immediate abundance
that prospective heirship could not supply, in the other there would
have been the security of the wife's gratitude, for Lush had always
been Mrs. Glasher's friend; and that the future Mrs. Grandcourt should
not be socially received could not affect his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) private comfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would
not have minded, either, that there should be no marriage in question
at all; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt himself justified in doing his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) utmost to hinder a
marriage with a girl who was likely to bring nothing but trouble to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
husband--not to speak of annoyance if not ultimate injury to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
husband's old companion, whose future Mr. Lush earnestly wished to make
as easy as possible, considering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) had well deserved such
compensation for leading a dog's life, though that of a dog who enjoyed
many tastes undisturbed, and who profited by a large establishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>)
wished for himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) felt to be good, and was not conscious of
wishing harm to any one else; unless perhaps it were just now a little
harm to the inconvenient and impertinent Gwendolen. But the
easiest-humored of luxury and music, the toad-eater the least liable to
nausea, must be expected to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) susceptibilities. And Mr. Lush was
accustomed to be treated by the world in general as an apt, agreeable
fellow: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) had not made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) mind to be insulted by more than one
person.

<p/>With this imperfect preparation of a war policy, Lush was awaiting
Grandcourt's arrival, doing little more than wondering how the campaign
would begin. The first day Grandcourt was much occupied with the
stables, and amongst other things he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) ordered a groom to put a
side-saddle on Criterion and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) review the horse's paces. This
marked indication of purpose set Lush on considering over again whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should incur the ticklish consequences of speaking first, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
was still sure that no compromising step had been taken; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) rose
the next morning almost resolved that if Grandcourt seemed in as good a
humor as yesterday and entered at all into talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would let drop the
interesting facts about Gwendolen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) family, just to see how they
would work, and to get some guidance. But Grandcourt did not enter into
talk, and in answer to a question even about his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own convenience, no
fish could have maintained a more unwinking silence. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had read
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) letters he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) gave various orders to be executed or transmitted by
Lush, and then thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) shoulder toward that useful person, who
accordingly rose to leave the room. But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) was out of the door
Grandcourt turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) head slightly and gave a broken, languid <div class="bookquote">``Oh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lush/Lush</b></font>)</div>said Lush, who, it must have been observed, did not take
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) dusty puddings with a respectful air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut the door, will you? I can't speak into the corridor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Lush closed the door, came forward, and chose to sit down.

<p/>After a little pause Grandcourt said, <div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Harleth at Offendene?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was quite certain that Lush had made it his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) business to inquire
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) had some pleasure in thinking that Lush did not want
_him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>)_ to inquire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hardly know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Lush, carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``The family's utterly
done up. They and the Gascoignes too have lost all their money. It's
owing to some rascally banking business. The poor mother hasn't a
_sou_, it seems. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and the girls have to huddle themselves into a
little cottage like a laborer's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't lie to me, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lowest
audible tone. <div class="bookquote">``It's not amusing, and it answers no other purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Lush, more nettled than was common with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)--the prospect before him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) being more than commonly disturbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just tell me the truth, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no invention of mine. I have heard the story from
several--Bazley, Brackenshaw's man, for one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) is getting a new tenant
for Offendene.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean that. Is Miss Harleth there, or is she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) former tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my soul, I can't tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Lush, rather sulkily. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) may have
left yesterday. I heard she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) had taken a situation as governess; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) may
be gone to it for what I know. But if you wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) no doubt
the mother would send for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) back.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This sneer slipped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) tongue
without strict intention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send Hutchins to inquire whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) will be there tomorrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Lush did
not move. Like many persons who have thought over beforehand what they
shall say in given cases, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was impelled by an unexpected irritation
to say some of those prearranged things before the cases were given.
Grandcourt, in fact, was likely to get into a scrape so tremendous that
it was impossible to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) take the first step toward it without
remonstrance. Lush retained enough caution to use a tone of rational
friendliness, still he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own value to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) patron, and was
prepared to be daring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be as well for you to remember, Grandcourt, that you are
coming under closer fire now. There can be none of the ordinary
flirting done, which may mean everything or nothing. You must make up
your mind whether you wish to be accepted; and more than that, how you
would like being refused. Either one or the other. You can't be
philandering after her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) again for six weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt said nothing, but pressed the newspaper down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knees
and began to light another cigar. Lush took this as a sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was
willing to listen, and was the more bent on using the opportunity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
wanted, if possible, to find out which would be the more potent cause
of hesitation--probable acceptance or probable refusal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything has a more serious look now than it had before. There is
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) family to be provided for. You could not let your wife's mother
live in beggary. It will be a confoundedly hampering affair. Marriage
will pin you down in a way you haven't been used to; and in point of
money you have not too much elbow-room. And after all, what will you
get by it? You are master over your estates, present or future, as far
as choosing your heir goes; it's a pity to go on encumbering them for a
mere whim, which you may repent of in a twelvemonth. I should be sorry
to see you making a mess of your life in that way. If there were
anything solid to be gained by the marriage, that would be a different
affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lush's tone had gradually become more and more unctuous in its
friendliness of remonstrance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was almost in danger of forgetting
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was merely gambling in argument. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) left off, Grandcourt
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cigar out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mouth, and looking steadily at the moist end
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) adjusted the leaf with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) delicate finger-tips, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew before that you had an objection to my marrying Miss Harleth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) made a little pause before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``But I never
considered that a reason against it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never supposed you did,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Lush, not unctuously but dryly.
<div class="bookquote">``It was not _that_ I urged as a reason. I should have thought it might
have been a reason against it, after all your experience, that you
would be acting like the hero of a ballad, and making yourself
absurd--and all for what? You know you couldn't make up your mind
before. It's impossible you can care much about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). And as for the
tricks she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is likely to play, you may judge of that from what you heard
at Leubronn. However, what I wished to point out to you was, that there
can be no shilly-shally now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, looking round at Lush and fixing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) with
narrow eyes; <div class="bookquote">``I don't intend that there should be. I dare say it's
disagreeable to you. But if you suppose I care a damn for that you are
most stupendously mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lush/Lush</b></font>)</div>said Lush, rising with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) pockets, and
feeling some latent venom still within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if you have made up your
mind!--only there's another aspect of the affair. I have been speaking
on the supposition that it was absolutely certain she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would accept you,
and that destitution would have no choice. But I am not so sure that
the young lady is to be counted on. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is kittle cattle to shoe, I
think. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reasons for running away before.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Lush had moved
a step or two till he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) stood nearly in front of Grandcourt, though at
some distance from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) did not feel himself much restrained by
consequences, being aware that the only strong hold he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) had on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>)
present position was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) serviceableness; and even after a quarrel the
want of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) was likely sooner or later to recur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) foresaw that
Gwendolen would cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) to be ousted for a time, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) temper at
this moment urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) to risk a quarrel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reasons,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) repeated more significantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had come to that conclusion before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, with
contemptuous irony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I hardly think you know what her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reasons were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do, apparently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, not betraying by so much as an
eyelash that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cared for the reasons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and you had better know too, that you may judge of the influence
you have over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) swallows her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reasons and accepts you. For my
own part I would take odds against it. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw Lydia in Cardell Chase
and heard the whole story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt made no immediate answer, and only went on smoking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was
so long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) spoke that Lush moved about and looked out of the
windows, unwilling to go away without seeing some effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) daring
move. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had expected that Grandcourt would tax him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) with having
contrived the affair, since Mrs. Glasher was then living at Gadsmere, a
hundred miles off, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was prepared to admit the fact: what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cared
about was that Grandcourt should be staggered by the sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
intended advances must be made to a girl who had that knowledge in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
mind and had been scared by it. At length Grandcourt, seeing Lush turn
toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) again and said, contemptuously, <div class="bookquote">``What
follows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Here certainly was a <div class="bookquote">``mate''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>in answer to Lush's <div class="bookquote">``check:''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
exasperation with Grandcourt was perhaps stronger than it had ever been
before, it would have been idiocy to act as if any further move could
be useful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) gave a slight shrug with one shoulder, and was going to
walk away, when Grandcourt, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) seat toward the table, said,
as quietly as if nothing had occurred, <div class="bookquote">``Oblige me by pushing that pen
and paper here, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>No thunderous, bullying superior could have exercised the imperious
spell that Grandcourt did. Why, instead of being obeyed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had never
been told to go to a warmer place, was perhaps a mystery to those who
found themselves obeying him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). The pen and paper were pushed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) took them he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Just wait for this letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) scrawled with ease, and the brief note was quickly addressed. <div class="bookquote">``Let
Hutchins go with it at once, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, pushing the
letter away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/>As Lush had expected, it was addressed to Miss Harleth, Offendene. When
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) irritation had cooled down he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was glad there had been no explosive
quarrel; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) felt sure that there was a notch made against him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and
that somehow or other he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was intended to pay. It was also clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
that the immediate effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) revelation had been to harden
Grandcourt's previous determination. But as to the particular movements
that made this process in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) baffling mind, Lush could only toss up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) chin in despair of a theory.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVI.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) brings white asses laden with the freight
Of Tyrian vessels, purple, gold and balm,
To bribe my will: I'll bid them chase him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) forth,
Nor let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) breathe the taint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) surmise
On my secure resolve.
Ay, `tis secure:
And therefore let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) come to spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) freight.
For firmness hath its appetite and craves
The stronger lure, more strongly to resist;
Would know the touch of gold to fling it off;
Scent wine to feel its lip the soberer;
Behold soft byssus, ivory, and plumes
To say, <div class="bookquote">``They're fair, but I will none of them,''
 (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div>And flout Enticement in the very face.


<p/>Mr. Gascoigne one day came to Offendene with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) felt to be the
satisfactory news that Mrs. Mompert had fixed Tuesday in the following
week for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) interview with Gwendolen at Wanchester. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) said nothing of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) having incidentally heard that Mr. Grandcourt had returned to
Diplow; knowing no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) did that Leubronn had been the goal of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) admirer's journeying, and feeling that it would be unkind uselessly
to revive the memory of a brilliant prospect under the present
reverses. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) secret soul he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) niece's unintelligible
caprice with regret, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) vindicated her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to himself by considering
that Grandcourt had been the first to behave oddly, in suddenly walking
away when there had the best opportunity for crowning his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) marked
attentions. The rector's practical judgment told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) chief
duty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) niece now was to encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) resolutely to face the
change in her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) lot, since there was no manifest promise of any event
that would avert it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will find an interest in varied experience, my dear, and I have no
doubt you will be a more valuable woman for having sustained such a
part as you are called to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot pretend to believe that I shall like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, for
the first time showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle some petulance. <div class="bookquote">``But I am quite aware
that I am obliged to bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) remembered having submitted to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) admonition on a different
occasion when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was expected to like a very different prospect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your good sense will teach you to behave suitably under it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Gascoigne, with a shade more gravity. <div class="bookquote">``I feel sure that Mrs.
Mompert will be pleased with you. You will know how to conduct yourself
to a woman who holds in all senses the relation of a superior to you.
This trouble has come on you young, but that makes it in some respects
easier, and there is a benefit in all chastisement if we adjust our
minds to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>This was precisely what Gwendolen was unable to do; and after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle
was gone, the bitter tears, which had rarely come during the late
trouble, rose and fell slowly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sat alone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart denied that
the trouble was easier because she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was young. When was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to have any
happiness, if it did not come while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was young? Not that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) visions
of possible happiness for herself were as unmixed with necessary evil
as they used to be--not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could still imagine herself plucking
the fruits of life without suspicion of their core. But this general
disenchantment with the world--nay, with herself, since it appeared
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not made for easy pre-eminence--only intensified her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sense
of forlornness; it was a visibly sterile distance enclosing the dreary
path at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feet, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had no courage to tread. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was in that
first crisis of passionate youthful rebellion against what is not fitly
called pain, but rather the absence of joy--that first rage of
disappointment in life's morning, which we whom the years have subdued
are apt to remember but dimly as part of our own experience, and so to
be intolerant of its self-enclosed unreasonableness and impiety. What
passion seems more absurd, when we have got outside it and looked at
calamity as a collective risk, than this amazed anguish that I and not
Thou, He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) or She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), should be just the smitten one? Yet perhaps some who
have afterward made themselves a willing fence before the breast of
another, and have carried their own heart-wound in heroic silence--some
who have made their deeds great, nevertheless began with this angry
amazement at their own smart, and on the mere denial of their fantastic
desires raged as if under the sting of wasps which reduced the universe
for them to an unjust infliction of pain. This was nearly poor
Gwendolen's condition. What though such a reverse as hers had often
happened to other girls? The one point she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life
learning to care for was, that it had happened to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)_: it was what
_she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)_ felt under Klesmer's demonstration that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not remarkable
enough to command fortune by force of will and merit; it was what _she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)_
would feel under the rigors of Mrs. Mompert's constant expectation,
under the dull demand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) should be cheerful with three Miss
Momperts, under the necessity of showing herself entirely submissive,
and keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) thoughts to herself. To be a queen disthroned is not so
hard as some other down-stepping: imagine one who had been made to
believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) own divinity finding all homage withdrawn, and himself
unable to perform a miracle that would recall the homage and restore
his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) own confidence. Something akin to this illusion and this
helplessness had befallen the poor spoiled child, with the lovely lips
and eyes and the majestic figure--which seemed now to have no magic in
them.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) rose from the low ottoman where she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) had been sitting purposeless,
and walked up and down the drawing-room, resting her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) elbow on one palm
while she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) leaned down her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) cheek on the other, and a slow tear fell. She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>)
thought, <div class="bookquote">``I have always, ever since I was little, felt that mamma was
not a happy woman; and now I dare say I shall be more unhappy than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
has been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) mind dwelt for a few moments on the picture of herself losing her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>)
youth and ceasing to enjoy--not minding whether she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) did this or that:
but such picturing inevitably brought back the image of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor mamma! it will be still worse for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now. I can get a little
money for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--that is all I shall care about now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then with an
entirely new movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) imagination, she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) mother getting
quite old and white, and herself no longer young but faded, and their
two faces meeting still with memory and love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) knowing what was
in her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) mother's mind--<div class="bookquote">``Poor Gwen too is sad and faded now'' (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>--and then,
for the first time, she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) sobbed, not in anger, but with a sort of tender
misery.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) face was toward the door, and she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) mother enter. She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) barely
saw that; for her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) eyes were large with tears, and she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>)
handkerchief against them hurriedly. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) took it away she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) felt
her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) mother's arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), and this sensation, which seemed a
prolongation of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) inward vision, overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) will to be reticent;
she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) sobbed anew in spite of herself, as they pressed their cheeks
together.

<p/>Mrs. Davilow had brought something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) hand which had already caused
her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) an agitating anxiety, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) dared not speak until her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) darling had
become calmer. But Gwendolen, with whom weeping had always been a
painful manifestation to be resisted, if possible, again pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
handkerchief against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, and, with a deep breath, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head
backward and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, who was pale and tremulous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was nothing, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, thinking that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother had
been moved in this way simply by finding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in distress. <div class="bookquote">``It is all
over now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mrs. Davilow had withdrawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) arms, and Gwendolen perceived a
letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that letter?--worse news still?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) asked, with a touch of
bitterness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you will think it, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, keeping
the letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``You will hardly guess where it comes from.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me to guess anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, rather impatiently,
as if a bruise were being pressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is addressed to you, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen gave the slightest perceptible toss of the head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It comes from Diplow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) the letter.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) knew Grandcourt's indistinct handwriting, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) mother was not
surprised to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) blush deeply; but watching her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) read, and
wondering much what was the purport of the letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw the color
die out. Gwendolen's lips even were pale as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned the open note
toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother. The words were few and formal:

<p/>Mr. Grandcourt presents his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) compliments to Miss Harleth, and begs to
know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) may be permitted to call at Offendene tomorrow after
two and to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) alone. Mr. Grandcourt has just returned from
Leubronn, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had hoped to find Miss Harleth.

<p/>Mrs. Davilow read, and then looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) daughter inquiringly, leaving
the note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) hand. Gwendolen let it fall to the floor, and turned
away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be answered, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, timidly. <div class="bookquote">``The man
waits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen sank on the settee, clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands, and looked straight
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), not at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had the expression of one who had
been startled by a sound and was listening to know what would come of
it. The sudden change of the situation was bewildering. A few minutes
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was looking along an inescapable path of repulsive monotony,
with hopeless inward rebellion against the imperious lot which left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
no choice: and lo, now, a moment of choice was come. Yet--was it
triumph she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt most or terror? Impossible for Gwendolen not to feel
some triumph in a tribute to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power at a time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was first
tasting the bitterness of insignificance: again she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seemed to be
getting a sort of empire over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own life. But how to use it? Here
came the terror. Quick, quick, like pictures in a book beaten open with
a sense of hurry, came back vividly, yet in fragments, all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
gone through in relation to Grandcourt--the allurements, the
vacillations, the resolve to accede, the final repulsion; the incisive
face of that dark-eyed lady with the lovely boy: her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own pledge -LRB-was it
a pledge not to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?-RRB---the new disbelief in the worth of men and
things for which that scene of disclosure had become a symbol. That
unalterable experience made a vision at which in the first agitated
moment, before tempering reflections could suggest themselves, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
native terror shrank.

<p/>Where was the good of choice coming again? What did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wish? Anything
different? No! And yet in the dark seed-growths of consciousness a new
wish was forming itself--<div class="bookquote">``I wish I had never known it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Something,
anything she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wished for that would have saved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from the dread to let
Grandcourt come.

<p/>It was no long while--yet it seemed long to Mrs. Davilow, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
thought it well to say, gently--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be necessary for you to write, dear. Or shall I write an
answer for you--which you will dictate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, drawing a deep breath. <div class="bookquote">``But please lay me
out the pen and paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That was gaining time. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to decline Grandcourt's visit--close the
shutters--not even look out on what would happen?--though with the
assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should remain just where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was? The young activity
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) made a warm current through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) terror and stirred toward
something that would be an event--toward an opportunity in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could look and speak with the former effectiveness. The interest of the
morrow was no longer at a deadlock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is really no reason on earth why you should be so alarmed at the
man's waiting a few minutes, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, remonstrantly, as
Mrs. Davilow, having prepared the writing materials, looked toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
expectantly. <div class="bookquote">``Servants expect nothing else than to wait. It is not to
be supposed that I must write on the instant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, in the tone of one corrected, turning to
sit down and take up a bit of work that lay at hand; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can wait
another quarter of an hour, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>If was very simple speech and action on her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) part, but it was what might
have been subtly calculated. Gwendolen felt a contradictory desire to
be hastened: hurry would save her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from deliberate choice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to wait long enough for that needlework to be
finished,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands to stroke the backward curves of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hair, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seat and stood still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you don't feel able to decide?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow,
sympathizingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I _must_ decide,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, walking to the writing-table and
seating herself. All the while there was a busy undercurrent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
like the thought of a man who keeps up a dialogue while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
considering how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can slip away. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) not let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come? It
bound her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been to Leubronn after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
meant a direct unmistakable renewal of the suit which before had been
only implied. What then? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could reject him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to deny
herself the freedom of doing this--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would like to do?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mr. Grandcourt has only just returned from Leubronn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Davilow, observing that Gwendolen leaned back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chair after taking
the pen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand--<div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) has heard of our misfortunes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That could make no difference to a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, rather contemptuously,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would to some men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow. <div class="bookquote">``They would not like to take
a wife from a family in a state of beggary almost, as we are. Here we
are at Offendene with a great shell over us, as usual. But just imagine
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finding us at Sawyer's Cottage. Most men are afraid of being bored
or taxed by a wife's family. If Mr. Grandcourt did know, I think it a
strong proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) attachment to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow spoke with unusual emphasis: it was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had
ventured to say anything about Grandcourt which would necessarily seem
intended as an argument in favor of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) habitual impression being
that such arguments would certainly be useless and might be worse. The
effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) words now was stronger than she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) could imagine. They
raised a new set of possibilities in Gwendolen's mind--a vision of what
Grandcourt might do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), Gwendolen, did--what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
not going to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was so moved by a new rush of ideas that, like one
conscious of being urgently called away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt that the immediate
task must be hastened: the letter must be written, else it might be
endlessly deferred. After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) acted in a hurry, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had wished
to do. To act in a hurry was to have a reason for keeping away from an
absolute decision, and to leave open as many issues as possible.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wrote: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Harleth presents her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) compliments to Mr. Grandcourt.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) will be at home after two o'clock to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Before addressing the note she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Pray ring the bell, mamma, if
there is any one to answer it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) really did not know who did the
work of the house.

<p/>It was not till after the letter had been taken away and Gwendolen had
risen again, stretching out one arm and then resting it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head,
with a low moan which had a sound of relief in it, that Mrs. Davilow
ventured to ask--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say, Gwen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said that I should be at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>answered Gwendolen, rather loftily.
Then after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``You must not expect, because Mr. Grandcourt is
coming, that anything is going to happen, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't allow myself to expect anything, dear. I desire you to follow
your own feeling. You have never told me what that was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the use of telling?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, hearing a reproach in
that true statement. <div class="bookquote">``When I have anything pleasant to tell, you may be
sure I will tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Grandcourt will consider that you have already accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>),
in allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to come. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) note tells you plainly enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is
coming to make you an offer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; and I wish to have the pleasure of refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow looked up in wonderment, but Gwendolen implied her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wish
not to be questioned further by saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put down that detestable needle-work, and let us walk in the avenue. I
am stifled.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVII.

<p/>Desire has trimmed the sails, and Circumstance
Brings but the breeze to fill them.


<p/>While Grandcourt on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) beautiful black Yarico, the groom behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) on
Criterion, was taking the pleasant ride from Diplow to Offendene,
Gwendolen was seated before the mirror while her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother gathered up the
lengthy mass of light-brown hair which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been carefully brushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only gather it up easily and make a coil, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me bring you some ear-rings, Gwen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, when the
hair was adjusted, and they were both looking at the reflection in the
glass. It was impossible for them not to notice that the eyes looked
brighter than they had done of late, that there seemed to be a shadow
lifted from the face, leaving all the lines once more in their placid
youthfulness. The mother drew some inference that made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice rather
cheerful. <div class="bookquote">``You do want your earrings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mamma; I shall not wear any ornaments, and I shall put on my black
silk. Black is the only wear when one is going to refuse an offer,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) old smiles at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
rose to throw off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dressing-gown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose the offer is not made after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, not
without a sly intention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then that will be because I refuse it beforehand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``It
comes to the same thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a proud little toss of the head as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said this; and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) walked down-stairs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) long black robes, there was just that
firm poise of head and elasticity of form which had lately been
missing, as in a parched plant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother thought, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwen</b></font>) is quite
herself again. It must be pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) coming. Can her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwen</b></font>) mind be
really made up against him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen would have been rather angry if that thought had been
uttered; perhaps all the more because through the last twenty hours,
with a brief interruption of sleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been so occupied with
perpetually alternating images and arguments for and against the
possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) marrying Grandcourt, that the conclusion which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had determined on beforehand ceased to have any hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
consciousness: the alternate dip of counterbalancing thoughts begotten
of counterbalancing desires had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) into a state in which no
conclusion could look fixed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
resolve as before; but it was a form out of which the blood had been
sucked--no more a part of quivering life than the <div class="bookquote">``God's will be done''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>of one who is eagerly watching chances. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not mean to accept
Grandcourt; from the first moment of receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had meant
to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>); still, that could not but prompt her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to look the
unwelcome reasons full in the face until she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a little less awe of
them, could not hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination from filling out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knowledge
in various ways, some of which seemed to change the aspect of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
knew. By dint of looking at a dubious object with a constructive
imagination, who can give it twenty different shapes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) indistinct
grounds of hesitation before the interview at the Whispering Stones, at
present counted for nothing; they were all merged in the final
repulsion. If it had not been for that day in Cardell Chase, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said
to herself now, there would have been no obstacle to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) marrying
Grandcourt. On that day and after it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not reasoned and
balanced; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had acted with a force of impulse against which all
questioning was no more than a voice against a torrent. The impulse had
come--not only from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) maidenly pride and jealousy, not only from the
shock of another woman's calamity thrust close on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) vision, but--from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dread of wrong-doing, which was vague, it was true, and aloof from
the daily details of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life, but not the less strong. Whatever was
accepted as consistent with being a lady she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had no scruple about; but
from the dim region of what was called disgraceful, wrong, guilty, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
shrunk with mingled pride and terror; and even apart from shame, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
feeling would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) place any deliberate injury of another in
the region of guilt.

<p/>But now--did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) know exactly what was the state of the case with
regard to Mrs. Glasher and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) children? She (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had given a sort of
promise--had said, <div class="bookquote">``I will not interfere with your wishes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But would
another woman who married Grandcourt be in fact the decisive obstacle
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wishes, or be doing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) boy any real injury? Might it
not be just as well, nay better, that Grandcourt should marry? For what
could not a woman do when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was married, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew how to assert
herself? Here all was constructive imagination. Gwendolen had about as
accurate a conception of marriage--that is to say, of the mutual
influences, demands, duties of man and woman in the state of
matrimony--as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had of magnetic currents and the law of storms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma managed badly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way of summing up what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother's experience: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself would manage quite differently.
And the trials of matrimony were the last theme into which Mrs. Davilow
could choose to enter fully with this daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what mamma and my uncle would say if they knew about Mrs.
Glasher!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>thought Gwendolen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) inward debating; not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could
imagine herself telling them, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not felt bound to
silence. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what anybody would say; or what they would say to
Mr. Grandcourt's marrying some one else and having other children!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>To
consider what <div class="bookquote">``anybody''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>would say, was to be released from the
difficulty of judging where everything was obscure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) when feeling
had ceased to be decisive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had only to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) memories, which
proved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that <div class="bookquote">``anybody''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>regarded the illegitimate children as more
rightfully to be looked shy on and deprived of social advantages than
illegitimate fathers. The verdict of <div class="bookquote">``anybody''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>seemed to be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had no reason to concern herself greatly on behalf of Mrs. Glasher and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) children.

<p/>But there was another way in which they had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) concern. What
others might think, could not do away with a feeling which in the first
instance would hardly be too strongly described as indignation and
loathing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) should have been expected to unite herself with an
outworn life, full of backward secrets which must have been more keenly
felt than any association with _her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)_. True, the question of love on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
own part had occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) scarcely at all in relation to Grandcourt.
The desirability of marriage for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had always seemed due to other
feeling than love; and to be enamored was the part of the man, on whom
the advances depended. Gwendolen had found no objection to Grandcourt's
way of being enamored before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had had that glimpse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) past,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resented as if it had been a deliberate offense against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) advances to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)_ were deliberate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt a retrospective
disgust for them. Perhaps other men's lives were of the same kind--full
of secrets which made the ignorant suppositions of the women they
wanted to marry a farce at which they were laughing in their sleeves.

<p/>These feelings of disgust and indignation had sunk deep; and though
other troublous experience in the last weeks had dulled them from
passion into remembrance, it was chiefly their reverberating activity
which kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) firm to the understanding with herself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not
going to accept Grandcourt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never meant to form a new
determination; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had only been considering what might be thought or
said. If anything could have induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to change, it would have been
the prospect of making all things easy for <div class="bookquote">``poor mamma:''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
admitted, was a temptation. But no! she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was going to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).
Meanwhile, the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was coming to be refused was
inspiriting: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had the white reins in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands again; there was a
new current in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) frame, reviving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from the beaten-down
consciousness in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been left by the interview with Klesmer.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not now going to crave an opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) capabilities; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
going to exercise her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power.

<p/>Was this what made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart palpitate annoyingly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heard the
horse's footsteps on the gravel?--when Miss Merry, who opened the door
to Grandcourt, came to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) was in the drawing-room? The
hours of preparation and the triumph of the situation were apparently
of no use: she (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) might as well have seen Grandcourt coming suddenly on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) despondency. While walking into the
drawing-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) had to concentrate all her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) energy in that
self-control, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) appear gravely gracious--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>)
hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>), and answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) was quite well in a voice
as low and languid as his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) own. A moment afterward, when they were both
of them seated on two of the wreath-painted chairs--Gwendolen upright
with downcast eyelids, Grandcourt about two yards distant, leaning one
arm over the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) chair and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) left hand--any one seeing them as a picture would have
concluded that they were in some stage of love-making suspense. And
certainly the love-making had begun: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) already felt herself being
wooed by this silent man seated at an agreeable distance, with the
subtlest atmosphere of attar of roses and an attention bent wholly on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also considered himself to be wooing: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not a man to
suppose that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presence carried no consequences; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was exactly
the man to feel the utmost piquancy in a girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not found
quite calculable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was disappointed not to find you at Leubronn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usual
broken drawl having just a shade of amorous languor in it. <div class="bookquote">``The place
was intolerable without you. A mere kennel of a place. Don't you think
so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't judge what it would be without myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with some recovered sense of mischief. <div class="bookquote">''_With_
myself I like it well enough to have stayed longer, if I could. But I
was obliged to come home on account of family troubles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very cruel of you to go to Leubronn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, taking
no notice of the troubles, on which Gwendolen--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hardly knew
why--wished that there should be a clear understanding at once. <div class="bookquote">``You
must have known that it would spoil everything: you knew you were the
heart and soul of everything that went on. Are you quite reckless about
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It would be impossible to say <div class="bookquote">``yes''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in a tone that would be taken
seriously; equally impossible to say <div class="bookquote">``no;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but what else could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) say?
In her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) difficulty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned down her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyelids again and blushed over
face and neck. Grandcourt saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in a new phase, and believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) inclination. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should show
it more decidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps there is some deeper interest? Some attraction--some
engagement--which it would have been only fair to make me aware of? Is
there any man who stands between us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Inwardly the answer framed itself. <div class="bookquote">``No; but there is a woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Yet how
could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) utter this? Even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not promised that woman to be
silent, it would have been impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to enter on the subject
with Grandcourt. But how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arrest his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wooing by beginning to
make a formal speech--<div class="bookquote">``I perceive your intention--it is most
flattering, etc.'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>? A fish honestly invited to come and be eaten has a
clear course in declining, but how if it finds itself swimming against
a net? And apart from the network, would she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) have dared at once to say
anything decisive? Gwendolen had not time to be clear on that point. As
it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt compelled to silence, and after a pause, Grandcourt
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to understand that some one else is preferred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen, now impatient of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own embarrassment, determined to rush
at the difficulty and free herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes again and said
with something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) former clearness and defiance, <div class="bookquote">``No'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
to understand, <div class="bookquote">``What then? I may not be ready to take _you_.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>There was
nothing that Grandcourt could not understand which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) perceived likely
to affect his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) _amour propre_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The last thing I would do, is to importune you. I should not hope to
win you by making myself a bore. If there were no hope for me, I would
ask you to tell me so at once, that I might just ride away to--no
matter where.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Almost to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own astonishment, Gwendolen felt a sudden alarm at the
image of Grandcourt finally riding away. What would be left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) then?
Nothing but the former dreariness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to be there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
snatched at the subject that would defer any decisive answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear you are not aware of what has happened to us. I have lately had
to think so much of my mamma's troubles, that other subjects have been
quite thrown into the background. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has lost all her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fortune, and we
are going to leave this place. I must ask you to excuse my seeming
preoccupied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>In eluding a direct appeal Gwendolen recovered some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
self-possession. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoke with dignity and looked straight at
Grandcourt, whose long, narrow, impenetrable eyes met hers, and
mysteriously arrested them: mysteriously; for the subtly-varied drama
between man and woman is often such as can hardly be rendered in words
put together like dominoes, according to obvious fixed marks. The word
of all work, Love, will no more express the myriad modes of mutual
attraction, than the word Thought can inform you what is passing
through your neighbor's mind. It would be hard to tell on which
side--Gwendolen's or Grandcourt's--the influence was more mixed. At
that moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) strongest wish was to be completely master of this
creature--this piquant combination of maidenliness and mischief: that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew things which had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) start away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), spurred him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to
triumph over that repugnance; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should
triumph. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--ah, piteous equality in the need to dominate!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was overcome like the thirsty one who is drawn toward the seeming water
in the desert, overcome by the suffused sense that here in this man's
homage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lay the rescue from helpless subjection to an oppressive
lot.

<p/>All the while they were looking at each other; and Grandcourt said,
slowly and languidly, as if it were of no importance, other things
having been settled--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will tell me now, I hope, that Mrs. Davilow's loss of fortune will
not trouble you further. You will trust me to prevent it from weighing
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>). You will give me the claim to provide against that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>The little pauses and refined drawlings with which this speech was
uttered, gave time for Gwendolen to go through the dream of a life. As
the words penetrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), they had the effect of a draught of wine,
which suddenly makes all things easier, desirable things not so wrong,
and people in general less disagreeable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a momentary phantasmal
love for this man who chose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words so well, and who was a mere
incarnation of delicate homage. Repugnance, dread, scruples--these were
dim as remembered pains, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was already tasting relief under the
immediate pain of hopelessness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagined herself already springing
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, and being playful again. Yet when Grandcourt had ceased
to speak, there was an instant in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was conscious of being at
the turning of the ways.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very generous,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, not moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, and speaking
with a gentle intonation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You accept what will make such things a matter of course?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt, without any new eagerness. <div class="bookquote">``You consent to become my wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>This time Gwendolen remained quite pale. Something made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rise from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seat in spite of herself and walk to a little distance. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
turned and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands folded before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stood in silence.

<p/>Grandcourt immediately rose too, resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hat on the chair, but
still keeping hold of it. The evident hesitation of this destitute girl
to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) splendid offer stung him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) into a keenness of interest such
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had not known for years. None the less because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) attributed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hesitation entirely to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knowledge about Mrs. Glasher. In that
attitude of preparation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you command me to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>No familiar spirit could have suggested to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) more effective words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) go: that negative was a
clutch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seemed to herself to be, after all, only drifted toward the
tremendous decision--but drifting depends on something besides the
currents when the sails have been set beforehand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You accept my devotion?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hat by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) side
and looking straight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, without other movement. Their eyes
meeting in that way seemed to allow any length of pause: but wait as
long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) contradict herself! What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) for? He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had shut out any explanation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>came as gravely from Gwendolen's lips as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been
answering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) name in a court of justice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) received it gravely,
and they still looked at each other in the same attitude. Was there
ever such a way before of accepting the bliss-giving <div class="bookquote">``Yes'' (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>? Grandcourt
liked better to be at that distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and to feel under a
ceremony imposed by an indefinable prohibition that breathed from
Gwendolen's bearing.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did at length lay down his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hat and advance to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand,
just pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lips upon it and letting it go again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
behavior perfect, and gained a sense of freedom which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) almost
ready to be mischievous. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Yes''  (<font color='red'><b>prospects</b></font>)</div>entailed so little at this moment
that there was nothing to screen the reversal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gloomy prospects;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) vision was filled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own release from the Momperts, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mother's release from Sawyer's Cottage. With a happy curl of the lips,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you not see mamma? I will fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us wait a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) favorite attitude,
having his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) left forefinger and thumb in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) waist-coat pocket, and with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) right hand caressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) whisker, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) stood near Gwendolen and
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--not unlike a gentleman who has a felicitous introduction
at an evening party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you anything else to say to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, playfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I know having things said to you is a great bore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt, rather sympathetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not when they are things I like to hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it bother you to be asked how soon we can be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it will, to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chin saucily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to-day, then, but to-morrow. Think of it before I come to-morrow.
In a fortnight--or three weeks--as soon as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you think you will be tired of my company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I
notice when people are married the husband is not so much with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife
as when they are engaged. But perhaps I shall like that better, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) laughed charmingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have whatever you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And nothing that I don't like?--please say that; because I think I
dislike what I don't like more than I like what I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, finding herself in the woman's paradise, where all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
nonsense is adorable.

<p/>Grandcourt paused; these were subtilties in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had much
experience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know--this is such a brute of a world,
things are always turning up that one doesn't like. I can't always
hinder your being bored. If you like to ride Criterion, I can't hinder
his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) coming down by some chance or other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my friend Criterion, how is he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is outside: I made the groom ride him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), that you might see him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
had the side-saddle on for an hour or two yesterday. Come to the window
and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the creatures</b></font>)</div><p/>They could see the two horses being taken slowly round the sweep, and
the beautiful creatures, in their fine grooming, sent a thrill of
exultation through Gwendolen. They were the symbols of command and
luxury, in delightful contrast with the ugliness of poverty and
humiliation at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had lately been looking close.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you ride Criterion to-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt. <div class="bookquote">``If you will,
everything shall be arranged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like it of all things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I want to lose
myself in a gallop again. But now I must go and fetch mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take my arm to the door, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) accepted.
Their faces were very near each other, being almost on a level, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) manners as a lover more agreeable
than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had seen described. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had no alarm lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) meant to kiss
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and was so much at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ease, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) suddenly paused in the
middle of the room and said half archly, half earnestly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, while I think of it--there is something I dislike that you can
save me from. I do _not_ like Mr. Lush's company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall not have it. I'll get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least. I let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) hang on me because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) has always been a
poor devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, in an _adagio_ of utter indifference.
<div class="bookquote">``They got him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to travel with me when I was a lad. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was always that
coarse-haired kind of brute--sort of cross between a hog and a
_dilettante_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen laughed. All that seemed kind and natural enough:
Grandcourt's fastidiousness enhanced the kindness. And when they
reached the door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) way of opening it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was the perfection of
easy homage. Really, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was likely to be the least
disagreeable of husbands.

<p/>Mrs. Davilow was waiting anxiously in her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) bed-room when Gwendolen
entered, stepped toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) quickly, and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) on both cheeks
said in a low tone, <div class="bookquote">``Come down, mamma, and see Mr. Grandcourt. I am
engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, with a surprise that was rather
solemn than glad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in the same tone, and with a quickness which
implied that it was needless to ask questions. <div class="bookquote">``Everything is settled.
You are not going to Sawyer's Cottage, I am not going to be inspected
by Mrs. Mompert, and everything is to be as I like. So come down with
me immediately.''

<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Il est plus aisé de connoître l'homme en général que de connoître un
homme en particulier.--LA ROCHEFOUCAULD.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>An hour after Grandcourt had left, the important news of Gwendolen's
engagement was known at the rectory, and Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne, with
Anna, spent the evening at Offendene.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, let me congratulate you on having created a strong
attachment,''  (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>said the rector. <div class="bookquote">``You look serious, and I don't wonder at
it: a lifelong union is a solemn thing. But from the way Mr. Grandcourt
has acted and spoken I think we may already see some good arising out
of our adversity. It has given you an opportunity of observing your
future husband's delicate liberality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gascoigne referred to Grandcourt's mode of implying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would
provide for Mrs. Davilow--a part of the love-making which Gwendolen had
remembered to cite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother with perfect accuracy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have no doubt that Mr. Grandcourt would have behaved quite as
handsomely if you had not gone away to Germany, Gwendolen, and had been
engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), as you no doubt might have been, more than a month
ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne, feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) had to discharge a duty on
this occasion. <div class="bookquote">``But now there is no more room for caprice; indeed, I
trust you have no inclination to any. A woman has a great debt of
gratitude to a man who perseveres in making her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) such an offer. But no
doubt you feel properly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all sure that I do, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with saucy
gravity. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know everything it is proper to feel on being
engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The rector</b></font>)</div><p/>The rector patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) shoulder and smiled as at a bit of innocent
naughtiness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) wife took his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) behavior as an indication that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
was not to be displeased. As for Anna, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) kissed Gwendolen and said,
<div class="bookquote">``I do hope you will be happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>but then sank into the background and
tried to keep the tears back too. In the late days she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been
imagining a little romance about Rex--how if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) still longed for
Gwendolen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart might be softened by trouble into love, so that
they could by-and-by be married. And the romance had turned to a prayer
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), Anna, might be able to rejoice like a good sister, and only
think of being useful in working for Gwendolen, as long as Rex was not
rich. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wanted grace to rejoice in something else. Miss Merry
and the four girls, Alice with the high shoulders, Bertha and Fanny the
whisperers, and Isabel the listener, were all present on this family
occasion, when everything seemed appropriately turning to the honor and
glory of Gwendolen, and real life was as interesting as <div class="bookquote">``Sir Charles
Grandison.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>The evening passed chiefly in decisive remarks from the
rector, in answer to conjectures from the two elder ladies. According
to him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>), the case was not one in which he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) could think it his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) duty to
mention settlements: everything must, and doubtless would safely be
left to Mr. Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to know exactly what sort of places Ryelands and
Gadsmere are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gadsmere, I believe, is a secondary place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne; <div class="bookquote">``But
Ryelands I know to be one of our finest seats. The park is extensive
and the woods of a very valuable order. The house was built by Inigo
Jones, and the ceilings are painted in the Italian style. The estate is
said to be worth twelve thousand a year, and there are two livings, one
a rectory, in the gift of the Grandcourts. There may be some burdens on
the land. Still, Mr. Grandcourt was an only child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be most remarkable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) were to
become Lord Stannery in addition to everything else. Only think: there
is the Grandcourt estate, the Mallinger estate, _and_ the baronetcy,
_and_ the peerage,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) was marking off the items on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) fingers, and
paused on the fourth while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``but they say there will be no
land coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) with the peerage.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It seemed a pity there was
nothing for the fifth finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The peerage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>said the rector, judiciously, <div class="bookquote">``must be regarded as a
remote chance. There are two cousins between the present peer and Mr.
Grandcourt. It is certainly a serious reflection how death and other
causes do sometimes concentrate inheritances on one man. But an excess
of that kind is to be deprecated. To be Sir Mallinger Grandcourt
Mallinger--I suppose that will be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) style--with corresponding
properties, is a valuable talent enough for any man to have committed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Let us hope it will be well used.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what a position for the wife, Gwendolen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne; <div class="bookquote">``a
great responsibility indeed. But you must lose no time in writing to
Mrs. Mompert, Henry. It is a good thing that you have an engagement of
marriage to offer as an excuse, else she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) might feel offended. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) is
rather a high woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am rid of that horror,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>thought Gwendolen, to whom the name of
Mompert had become a sort of Mumbo-jumbo. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was very silent through
the evening, and that night could hardly sleep at all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) little
white bed. It was a rarity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) strong youth to be wakeful: and
perhaps a still greater rarity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to be careful that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother
should not know of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) restlessness. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) state of mind was
altogether new: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) who had been used to feel sure of herself, and
ready to manage others, had just taken a decisive step which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
beforehand thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would not take--nay, perhaps, was bound not
to take. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not go backward now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) liked a great deal of what
lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and there was nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to like if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went back.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resolution was dogged by the shadow of that previous resolve
which had at first come as the undoubting movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) whole being.
While she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pillow with wide-open eyes, <div class="bookquote">``looking on darkness
which the blind do see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was appalled by the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
going to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had once started away from with repugnance. It was
new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that a question of right or wrong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) conduct should
rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) terror; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had known no compunction that atoning caresses
and presents could not lay to rest. But here had come a moment when
something like a new consciousness was awaked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seemed on the edge
of adopting deliberately, as a notion for all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life,
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had rashly said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) bitterness, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) discovery had
driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) away to Leubronn:--that it did not signify what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had only to amuse herself as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could. That lawlessness, that
casting away of all care for justification, suddenly frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): it
came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with the shadowy array of possible calamity behind
it--calamity which had ceased to be a mere name for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and all the
infiltrated influences of disregarded religious teaching, as well as
the deeper impressions of something awful and inexorable enveloping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), seemed to concentrate themselves in the vague conception of
avenging power. The brilliant position she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had longed for, the imagined
freedom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would create for herself in marriage, the deliverance from
the dull insignificance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) girlhood--all immediately before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>);
and yet they had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hunger like food with the taint of
sacrilege upon it, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) must snatch with terror. In the darkness
and loneliness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) little bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) more resistant self could not act
against the first onslaught of dread after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) irrevocable decision.
That unhappy-faced woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) children--Grandcourt and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) relations
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--kept repeating themselves in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination like the
clinging memory of a disgrace, and gradually obliterated all other
thought, leaving only the consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had taken those scenes
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) long wakefulness seemed a delirium; a faint, faint
light penetrated beside the window-curtain; the chillness increased.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could bear it no longer, and cried <div class="bookquote">``Mamma!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, immediately, in a wakeful voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me come to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) soon went to sleep on her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) mother's shoulder, and slept on till
late, when, dreaming of a lit-up ball-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
mother standing by the bedside with a small packet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to wake you, darling, but I thought it better to give you
this at once. The groom has brought Criterion; he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) has come on another
horse, and says he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) is to stay here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen sat up in bed and opened the packet. It was a delicate
enameled casket, and inside was a splendid diamond ring with a letter
which contained a folded bit of colored paper and these words:--

<p/>Pray wear this ring when I come at twelve in sign of our betrothal. I
enclose a check drawn in the name of Mr. Gascoigne, for immediate
expenses. Of course Mrs. Davilow will remain at Offendene, at least
for some time. I hope, when I come, you will have granted me an early
day, when you may begin to command me at a shorter distance.

<p/>Yours devotedly,

<p/>H. M. GRANDCOURT.

<p/>The check was for five hundred pounds, and Gwendolen turned it toward
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, with the letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very kind and delicate!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, with much feeling.
<div class="bookquote">``But I really should like better not to be dependent on a son-in-law. I
and the girls could get along very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, if you say that again, I will not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, I trust you are not going to marry only for my sake,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, depreciatingly.

<p/>Gwendolen tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head on the pillow away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, and let
the ring lie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was irritated at this attempt to take away a motive.
Perhaps the deeper cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) irritation was the consciousness that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not going to marry solely for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's sake--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
drawn toward the marriage in ways against which stronger reasons than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's renunciation were yet not strong enough to hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had waked up to the signs that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was irrevocably engaged, and all the
ugly visions, the alarms, the arguments of the night, must be met by
daylight, in which probably they would show themselves weak. <div class="bookquote">``What I
long for is your happiness, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Davilow, pleadingly.
<div class="bookquote">``I will not say anything to vex you. Will you not put on the ring?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>For a few moments Gwendolen did not answer, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thoughts were
active. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) raised herself with a determination to do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
would do if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had started on horseback, and go on with spirit,
whatever ideas might be running in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought the lover always put on the betrothal ring himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
said laughingly, slipping the ring on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) finger, and looking at it
with a charming movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I know why he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) has sent it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
added, nodding at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would rather make me put it on than ask me to let him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) do it. Aha!
he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) is very proud. But so am I. We shall match each other. I should hate
a man who went down on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, and came fawning on me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really is
not disgusting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very moderate praise, Gwen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it is not, for a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen gaily. <div class="bookquote">``But now I must get
up and dress. Will you come and do my hair, mamma, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went on,
drawing down her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mamma's face to caress it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own cheeks, <div class="bookquote">``and
not be so naughty any more as to talk of living in poverty? You must
bear to be made comfortable, even if you don't like it. And Mr.
Grandcourt behaves perfectly, now, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, encouraged, and persuaded that
after all Gwendolen was fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) betrothed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) herself thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
a man whose attentions were likely to tell on a girl's feeling. Suitors
must often be judged as words are, by the standing and the figure they
make in polite society: it is difficult to know much else of them. And
all the mother's anxiety turned not on Grandcourt's character, but on
Gwendolen's mood in accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).

<p/>The mood was necessarily passing through a new phase this morning. Even
in the hour of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) toilet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had drawn on all the knowledge
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had for grounds to justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) marriage. And what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) most dwelt on
was the determination, that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was Grandcourt's wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would
urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to the most liberal conduct toward Mrs. Glasher's children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what use would it be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwen</b></font>) that I should not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could
have married her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwen</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) liked; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did _not_ like. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwen</b></font>) is to
blame for that. There must be a great deal about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwen</b></font>) that I know
nothing of. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) must have been good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwen</b></font>) in many ways, else she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwen</b></font>)
would not have wanted to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But that last argument at once began to appear doubtful. Mrs. Glasher
naturally wished to exclude other children who would stand between
Grandcourt and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) own: and Gwendolen's comprehension of this feeling
prompted another way of reconciling claims.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps we shall have no children. I hope we shall not. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) might
leave the estate to the pretty little boy. My uncle said that Mr.
Grandcourt could do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) liked with the estates. Only when Sir Hugo
Mallinger dies there will be enough for two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glasher</b></font>)</div><p/>This made Mrs. Glasher appear quite unreasonable in demanding that her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
boy should be sole heir; and the double property was a security that
Grandcourt's marriage would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) no wrong, when the wife was
Gwendolen Harleth with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) proud resolution not to be fairly
accused. This maiden had been accustomed to think herself blameless;
other persons only were faulty.

<p/>It was striking, that in the hold which this argument of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) doing no
wrong to Mrs. Glasher had taken on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) mind, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) repugnance to the idea
of Grandcourt's past had sunk into a subordinate feeling. The terror
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had felt in the night-watches at overstepping the border of
wickedness by doing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had at first felt to be wrong, had dulled
any emotions about his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) conduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) was thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
might be, as a man over whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) was going to have indefinite power;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) loving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) having never been a question with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>), any
agreeableness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had was so much gain. Poor Gwendolen had no awe of
unmanageable forces in the state of matrimony, but regarded it as
altogether a matter of management, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would know how to act.
In relation to Grandcourt's past she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) encouraged new doubts whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
were likely to have differed much from other men; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) devised
little schemes for learning what was expected of men in general.

<p/>But whatever else might be true in the world, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hair was dressed
suitably for riding, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) riding-habit, to avoid
delay before getting on horseback. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wanted to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) blood stirred
once more with the intoxication of youth, and to recover the daring
with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been used to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) course in life. Already a
load was lifted off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); for in daylight and activity it was less
oppressive to have doubts about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) choice, than to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
no choice but to endure insignificance and servitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go back and make yourself look like a duchess, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said,
turning suddenly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was going down-stairs. <div class="bookquote">``Put your point-lace
over your head. I must have you look like a duchess. You must not take
things humbly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>When Grandcourt raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) left hand gently and looked at the ring, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
said gravely, <div class="bookquote">``It was very good of you to think of everything and send
me that packet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will tell me if there is anything I forget?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, keeping the
hand softly within his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``I will do anything you wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am very unreasonable in my wishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I expect that. Women always are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will not be unreasonable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, taking away her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand
and tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head saucily. <div class="bookquote">``I will not be told that I am what women
always are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) usual
gravity. <div class="bookquote">``You are what no other woman is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is that, pray?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, moving to a distance with a
little air of menace.

<p/>Grandcourt made his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) pause before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``You are the woman I
love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what nice speeches!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, laughing. The sense of that
love which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) must once have given to another woman under strange
circumstances was getting familiar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me a nice speech in return. Say when we are to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet. Not till we have had a gallop over the downs. I am so thirsty
for that, I can think of nothing else. I wish the hunting had begun.
Sunday the twentieth, twenty-seventh, Monday, Tuesday.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen was
counting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fingers with the prettiest nod while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked at
Grandcourt, and at last swept one palm over the other while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said
triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``It will begin in ten days!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us be married in ten days, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, <div class="bookquote">``and we shall
not be bored about the stables.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do women always say in answer to that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
mischievously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They agree to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lover</b></font>)</div>said the lover, rather off his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) guard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gauntlets and putting
them on, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) with gathering fun in them.

<p/>The scene was pleasant on both sides. A cruder lover would have lost
the view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pretty ways and attitudes, and spoiled all by stupid
attempts at caresses, utterly destructive of drama. Grandcourt
preferred the drama; and Gwendolen, left at ease, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spirits
rising continually as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) played at reigning. Perhaps if Klesmer had
seen more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in this unconscious kind of acting, instead of when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was trying to be theatrical, he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) might have rated her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chance higher.

<p/>When they had had a glorious gallop, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was in a state of
exhilaration that disposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to think well of hastening the marriage
which would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life all of apiece with this splendid kind of
enjoyment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would not debate any more about an act to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
committed herself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consented to fix the wedding on that day
three weeks, notwithstanding the difficulty of fulfilling the customary
laws of the _trousseau_.

<p/>Lush, of course, was made aware of the engagement by abundant signs,
without being formally told. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) expected some communication as a
consequence of it, and after a few days he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) became rather impatient
under Grandcourt's silence, feeling sure that the change would affect
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) personal prospects, and wishing to know exactly how. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) tactics no
longer included any opposition--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not love for its own sake.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) might easily cause Grandcourt a great deal of annoyance, but it
would be to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own injury, and to create annoyance was not a motive
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). Miss Gwendolen he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would certainly not have been sorry to
frustrate a little, but--after all there was no knowing what would
come. It was nothing new that Grandcourt should show a perverse
wilfulness; yet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) freak about this girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) struck Lush rather
newly as something like a man who was _fey_--led on by an ominous
fatality; and that one born to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) fortune should make a worse business
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) life than was necessary, seemed really pitiable. Having
protested against the marriage, Lush had a second-sight for its evil
consequences. Grandcourt had been taking the pains to write letters and
give orders himself instead of employing Lush, and appeared to be
ignoring his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) usefulness, even choosing, against the habit of years, to
breakfast alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) dressing-room. But a _tete-à-tete_ was not to be
avoided in a house empty of guests; and Lush hastened to use an
opportunity of saying--it was one day after dinner, for there were
difficulties in Grandcourt's dining at Offendene--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when is the marriage to take place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guests</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt, who drank little wine, had left the table and was lounging,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) smoked, in an easy chair near the hearth, where a fire of oak
boughs was gaping to its glowing depths, and edging them with a
delicate tint of ashes delightful to behold. The chair of red-brown
velvet brocade was a becoming back-ground for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) pale-tinted, well-cut
features and exquisite long hands. Omitting the cigar, you might have
imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) a portrait by Moroni, who would have rendered wonderfully
the impenetrable gaze and air of distinction; and a portrait by that
great master would have been quite as lively a companion as Grandcourt
was disposed to be. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) answered without unusual delay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the tenth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you intend to remain here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall go to Ryelands for a little while; but we shall return here
for the sake of the hunting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>After this word there was the languid inarticulate sound frequent with
Grandcourt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) meant to continue speaking, and Lush waited for
something more. Nothing came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was going to put another question,
when the inarticulate sound began again and introduced the mildly
uttered suggestion--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better make some new arrangement for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! I am to cut and run?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Lush, prepared to be good-tempered on
the occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something of that kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The bride objects to me. I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) will make up to you for the want
of my services.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help your being so damnably disagreeable to women,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt, in soothing apology.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To one woman, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes no difference since she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is the one in question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I am not to be turned adrift after fifteen years without
some provision.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have saved something out of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Deuced little. I have often saved something for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can have three hundred a year. But you must live in town and be
ready to look after things when I want you. I shall be rather hard up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are not going to be at Ryelands this winter, I might run down
there and let you know how Swinton goes on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you like. I don't care a toss where you are, so that you keep out
of sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much obliged,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Lush, able to take the affair more easily than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
had expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was supported by the secret belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should
by-and-by be wanted as much as ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you will not object to packing up as soon as possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt. <div class="bookquote">``The Torringtons are coming, and Miss Harleth will be
riding over here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart. Can't I be of use in going to Gadsmere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I am going myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About your being rather hard up. Have you thought of that plan--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just leave me alone, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lowest audible
tone, tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cigar into the fire, and rising to walk away.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) spent the evening in the solitude of the smaller drawing-room,
where, with various new publications on the table of the kind a
gentleman may like to have on hand without touching, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) employed
himself -LRB-as a philosopher might have done-RRB- in sitting meditatively on
the sofa and abstaining from literature--political, comic, cynical, or
romantic. In this way hours may pass surprisingly soon, without the
arduous invisible chase of philosophy; not from love of thought, but
from hatred of effort--from a state of the inward world, something like
premature age, where the need for action lapses into a mere image of
what has been, is, and may or might be; where impulse is born and dies
in a phantasmal world, pausing in rejection of even a shadowy
fulfillment. That is a condition which often comes with whitening hair;
and sometimes, too, an intense obstinacy and tenacity of rule, like the
main trunk of an exorbitant egoism, conspicuous in proportion as the
varied susceptibilities of younger years are stripped away.

<p/>But Grandcourt's hair, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had not much of it, was of a fine,
sunny blonde, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) moods were not entirely to be explained as ebbing
energy. We mortals have a strange spiritual chemistry going on within
us, so that a lazy stagnation or even a cottony milkiness may be
preparing one knows not what biting or explosive material. The navvy
waking from sleep and without malice heaving a stone to crush the life
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) still sleeping comrade, is understood to lack the trained
motive which makes a character fairly calculable in its actions; but by
a roundabout course even a gentleman may make of himself a chancy
personage, raising an uncertainty as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) may do next, that sadly
spoils companionship.

<p/>Grandcourt's thoughts this evening were like the circlets one sees in a
dark pool, continually dying out and continually started again by some
impulse from below the surface. The deeper central impulse came from
the image of Gwendolen; but the thoughts it stirred would be
imperfectly illustrated by a reference to the amatory poets of all
ages. It was characteristic that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) got none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) satisfaction from
the belief that Gwendolen was in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>); and that love had
overcome the jealous resentment which had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) run away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).
On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) believed that this girl was rather exceptional in
the fact that, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) assiduous attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not
in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>); and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) very likely that if it had not
been for the sudden poverty which had come over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) family, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would
not have accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). From the very first there had been an
exasperating fascination in the tricksiness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had--not met
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) advances, but--wheeled away from them. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been brought to
accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) in spite of everything--brought to kneel down like a horse
under training for the arena, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have an objection to it
all the while. On the whole, Grandcourt got more pleasure out of this
notion than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could have done out of winning a girl of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was
sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a strong inclination for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) personally. And yet this
pleasure in mastering reluctance flourished along with the habitual
persuasion that no woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) favored could be quite indifferent to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) personal influence; and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) not unlikely that
by-and-by Gwendolen might be more enamored of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). In
any case, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have to submit; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) enjoyed thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) future wife, whose pride and spirit were suited to command every
one but himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had no taste for a woman who was all tenderness to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), full of petitioning solicitude and willing obedience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) meant to
be master of a woman who would have liked to master him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and who
perhaps would have been capable of mastering another man.

<p/>Lush, having failed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attempted reminder to Grandcourt, thought it
well to communicate with Sir Hugo, in whom, as a man having perhaps
interest enough to command the bestowal of some place where the work
was light, gentlemanly, and not ill-paid, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was anxious to cultivate a
sense of friendly obligation, not feeling at all secure against the
future need of such a place. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote the following letter, and
addressed it to Park Lane, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) knew the family had returned from
Leubronn:--

<p/>MY DEAR SIR HUGO--Since we came home the marriage has been absolutely
decided on, and is to take place in less than three weeks. It is so
far the worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) mother has lately lost all her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) fortune,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) will have to find supplies. Grandcourt, I know, is feeling the
want of cash; and unless some other plan is resorted to, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) will be
raising money in a foolish way. I am going to leave Diplow
immediately, and I shall not be able to start the topic. What I should
advise is, that Mr. Deronda, who I know has your confidence, should
propose to come and pay a short visit here, according to invitation
-LRB-there are going to be other people in the house-RRB-, and that you should
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) fully in possession of your wishes and the possible extent of
your offer. Then, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should introduce the subject to Grandcourt
so as not to imply that you suspect any particular want of money on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) part, but only that there is a strong wish on yours, What I have
formerly said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) has been in the way of a conjecture that you
might be willing to give a good sum for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) chance of Diplow; but if
Mr. Deronda came armed with a definite offer, that would take another
sort of hold. Ten to one he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) will not close for some time to come; but
the proposal will have got a stronger lodgment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind; and though
at present he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) has a great notion of the hunting here, I see a
likelihood, under the circumstances, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) will get a distaste for
the neighborhood, and there will be the notion of the money sticking
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) without being urged. I would bet on your ultimate success. As I
am not to be exiled to Siberia, but am to be within call, it is
possible that, by and by, I may be of more service to you. But at
present I can think of no medium so good as Mr. Deronda. Nothing puts
Grandcourt in worse humor than having the lawyers thrust their paper
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) nose uninvited.

<p/>Trusting that your visit to Leubronn has put you in excellent
condition for the winter, I remain, my dear Sir Hugo,

<p/>Yours very faithfully,

<p/>THOMAS CRANMER LUSH.

<p/>Sir Hugo, having received this letter at breakfast, handed it to
Deronda, who, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had chambers in town, was somehow hardly ever
in them, Sir Hugo not being contented without him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>). The chatty baronet
would have liked a young companion even if there had been no peculiar
reasons for attachment between them: one with a fine harmonious
unspoiled face fitted to keep up a cheerful view of posterity and
inheritance generally, notwithstanding particular disappointments; and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) affection for Deronda was not diminished by the deep-lying though
not obtrusive difference in their notions and tastes. Perhaps it was
all the stronger; acting as the same sort of difference does between a
man and a woman in giving a piquancy to the attachment which subsists
in spite of it. Sir Hugo did not think unapprovingly of himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
looked at men and society from a liberal-menagerie point of view, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had a certain pride in Deronda's differing from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), which, if it
had found voice, might have said--<div class="bookquote">``You see this fine young fellow--not
such as you see every day, is he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?--he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) belongs to me in a sort of way. I
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) up from a child; but you would not ticket him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) off easily,
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has notions of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s as far as the poles asunder from
what I was at his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) age.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>This state of feeling was kept up by the mental
balance in Deronda, who was moved by an affectionateness such as we are
apt to call feminine, disposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to yield in ordinary details, while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had a certain inflexibility of judgment, and independence of
opinion, held to be rightfully masculine.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had read the letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) returned it without speaking, inwardly
wincing under Lush's mode of attributing a neutral usefulness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) in
the family affairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say, Dan? It would be pleasant enough for you. You have
not seen the place for a good many years now, and you might have a
famous run with the harriers if you went down next week,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not go on that account,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, buttering his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) bread
attentively. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had an objection to this transparent kind of
persuasiveness, which all intelligent animals are seen to treat with
indifference. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went to Diplow he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should be doing something
disagreeable to oblige Sir Hugo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Lush's notion is a good one. And it would be a pity to lose
the occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a different matter--if you think my going of importance to
your object,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, still with that aloofness of manner which
implied some suppression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) knew that the baronet had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) heart on
the affair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you will see the fair gambler, the Leubronn Diana, I shouldn't
wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, gaily. <div class="bookquote">``We shall have to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) to the
Abbey, when they are married,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) added, turning to Lady Mallinger, as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) too had read the letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot conceive whom you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Lady Mallinger, who in fact had
not been listening, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) mind having been taken up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) first sips
of coffee, the objectionable cuff of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) sleeve, and the necessity of
carrying Theresa to the dentist--innocent and partly laudable
preoccupations, as the gentle lady's usually were. Should her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
appearance be inquired after, let it be said that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had reddish
blonde hair -LRB-the hair of the period-RRB-, a small Roman nose, rather
prominent blue eyes and delicate eyelids, with a figure which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
thinner friends called fat, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands showing curves and dimples like a
magnified baby's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that Grandcourt is going to marry the girl you saw at
Leubronn--don't you remember her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--the Miss Harleth who used to play at
roulette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me! Is that a good match for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on the sort of goodness he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wants,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo,
smiling. <div class="bookquote">``However, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends have nothing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will bring
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) expenses. It's a good match for my purposes, because if I am
willing to fork out a sum of money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) may be willing to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
chance of Diplow, so that we shall have it out and out, and when I die
you will have the consolation of going to the place you would like to
go to--wherever I may go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would not talk of dying in that light way, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's rather a heavy way, Lou, for I shall have to pay a heavy
sum--forty thousand, at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why are we to invite them to the Abbey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Lady Mallinger. <div class="bookquote">``I
do _not_ like women who gamble, like Lady Cragstone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you will not mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Cragstone</b></font>) for a week. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cragstone</b></font>) is not like Lady
Cragstone because she (<font color='blue'><b>Cragstone</b></font>) gambled a little, any more than I am like a
broker because I'm a Whig. I want to keep Grandcourt in good humor, and
to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) see plenty of this place, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) may think the less of
Diplow. I don't know yet whether I shall get him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to meet me in this
matter. And if Dan were to go over on a visit there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) might hold out
the bait to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>). It would be doing me a great service.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>This was meant
for Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Daniel is not fond of Mr. Grandcourt, I think, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Mallinger, looking at Deronda inquiringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no avoiding everybody one doesn't happen to be fond of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``I will go to Diplow--I don't know that I have anything better
to do--since Sir Hugo wishes it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a trump!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, well pleased. <div class="bookquote">``And if you don't find
it very pleasant, it's so much experience. Nothing used to come amiss
to me when I was young. You must see men and manners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but I have seen that man, and something of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not nice manners, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Lady Mallinger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see they succeed with your sex,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, provokingly.
<div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an uncommonly good-looking fellow when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was two or three
and twenty--like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't take after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father in
marrying the heiress, though. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had got Miss Arrowpoint and my land
too, confound him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have had a fine principality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda, in anticipating the projected visit, felt less disinclination
than when consenting to it. The story of that girl's marriage did
interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>): what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had heard through Lush of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) having run away
from the suit of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was now going to take as a husband, had
thrown a new sort of light on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gambling; and it was probably the
transition from that fevered worldliness into poverty which had urged
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) acceptance where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must in some way have felt repulsion. All this
implied a nature liable to difficulty and struggle--elements of life
which had a predominant attraction for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sympathy, due perhaps to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
early pain in dwelling on the conjectured story of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own existence.
Persons attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as Hans Meyrick had done, in proportion to the
possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) defending them, rescuing them, telling upon their
lives with some sort of redeeming influence; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had to resist an
inclination, easily accounted for, to withdraw coldly from the
fortunate. But in the movement which had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) to repurchase
Gwendolen's necklace for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and which was at work in him (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) still, there
was something beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) habitual compassionate fervor--something due
to the fascination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) womanhood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was very open to that sort of
charm, and mingled it with the consciously Utopian pictures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) own
future; yet any one able to trace the folds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) character might have
conceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) would be more likely than many less passionate men to
love a woman without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of it. Sprinkle food before a
delicate-eared bird: there is nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) would more willingly take, yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) keeps aloof, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) sensibility to checks which to you are
imperceptible. And one man differs from another, as we all differ from
the Bosjesman, in a sensibility to checks, that come from variety of
needs, spiritual or other. It seemed to foreshadow that capability of
reticence in Deronda that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagination was much occupied with two
women, to neither of whom would he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) have held it possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should
ever make love. Hans Meyrick had laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) for having something of
the knight-errant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) disposition; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) would have found his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) proof
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had known what was just now going on in Deronda's mind about
Mirah and Gwendolen.

<p/>Deronda wrote without delay to announce his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) visit to Diplow, and
received in reply a polite assurance that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) coming would give great
pleasure. That was not altogether untrue. Grandcourt thought it
probable that the visit was prompted by Sir Hugo's desire to court him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
for a purpose which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) did not make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) mind to resist; and it was
not a disagreeable idea to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) that this fine fellow, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) believed
to be his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cousin under the rose, would witness, perhaps with some
jealousy, Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt play the commanding part of
betrothed lover to a splendid girl whom the cousin had already looked
at with admiration.

<p/>Grandcourt himself was not jealous of anything unless it threatened his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
mastery--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not think himself likely to lose.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice,
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) I shall follow.
As the water follows the moon, silently,
with fluid steps anywhere around the globe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--WALT WHITMAN.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now my cousins are at Diplow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, <div class="bookquote">``will you go
there?--to-morrow? The carriage shall come for Mrs. Davilow. You can
tell me what you would like done in the rooms. Things must be put in
decent order while we are away at Ryelands. And to-morrow is the only
day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was sitting sideways on a sofa in the drawing-room at Offendene, one
hand and elbow resting on the back, and the other hand thrust between
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) crossed knees--in the attitude of a man who is much interested in
watching the person next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). Gwendolen, who had always disliked
needlework, had taken to it with apparent zeal since her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) engagement,
and now held a piece of white embroidery which, on examination, would
have shown many false stitches. During the last eight or nine days
their hours had been chiefly spent on horseback, but some margin had
always been left for this more difficult sort of companionship, which,
however, Gwendolen had not found disagreeable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was very well
satisfied with Grandcourt. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) answers to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lively questions about
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had seen and done in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) life, bore drawling very well. From
the first she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knew what to say; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
constantly feeling not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had nothing of the fool in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
composition, but that by some subtle means he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) communicated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) the
impression that all the folly lay with other people, who did what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
did not care to do. A man who seems to have been able to command the
best, has a sovereign power of depreciation. Then Grandcourt's behavior
as a lover had hardly at all passed the limit of an amorous homage
which was inobtrusive as a wafted odor of roses, and spent all its
effects in a gratified vanity. One day, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had kissed not her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
cheek but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck a little below her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ear; and Gwendolen, taken by
surprise, had started up with a marked agitation which made him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) rise
too and say, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon--did I annoy you?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it was
nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, rather afraid of herself, <div class="bookquote">``only I cannot
bear--to be kissed under my ear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sat down again with a little
playful laugh, but all the while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart beating with a
vague fear: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was no longer at liberty to flout him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
flouted poor Rex. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) agitation seemed not uncomplimentary, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had
been contented not to transgress again.

<p/>To-day a slight rain hindered riding; but to compensate, a package had
come from London, and Mrs. Davilow had just left the room after
bringing in for admiration the beautiful things -LRB-of Grandcourt's
ordering-RRB- which lay scattered about on the tables. Gwendolen was just
then enjoying the scenery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands fall on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
lap, and said with a pretty air of perversity--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is to-morrow the only day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because the next day is the first with the hounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And after that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After that I must go away for a couple of days--it's a bore--but I
shall go one day and come back the next.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>Grandcourt noticed a change
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face, and releasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hand from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knees, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) laid it on
hers, and said, <div class="bookquote">``You object to my going away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use objecting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, coldly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was resisting to
the utmost her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) temptation to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) suspected to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was
going--the temptation to make a clean breast, speaking without
restraint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, enfolding her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I will put off
going. And I will travel at night, so as only to be away one day.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knew the reason of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) inwardly called this bit of
temper, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was particularly fascinating to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) at this moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't put off going, but travel at night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could command him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and finding in this peremptoriness
a small outlet for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) irritation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you will go to Diplow to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, if you wish it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a high tone of careless
assent. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) concentration in other feelings had really hindered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
from taking notice that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand was being held.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How you treat us poor devils of men!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
tone. <div class="bookquote">``We are always getting the worst of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Are_ you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a tone of inquiry, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) more
naïvely than usual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) longed to believe this commonplace _badinage_
as the serious truth about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lover: in that case, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) too was
justified. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew everything, Mrs. Glasher would appear more
blamable than Grandcourt. <div class="bookquote">''_Are_ you always getting the worst?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glasher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Are you as kind to me as I am to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, looking
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) narrow gaze.

<p/>Gwendolen felt herself stricken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was conscious of having received
so much, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sense of command was checked, and sank away in the
perception that, look around her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not turn back:
it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had consented to mount a chariot where another held
the reins; and it was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nature to leap out in the eyes of the
world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not consented in ignorance, and all she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could say now
would be a confession that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not been ignorant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) right to
explanation was gone. All she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had to do now was to adjust herself, so
that the spikes of that unwilling penance which conscience imposed
should not gall her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). With a sort of mental shiver, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resolutely
changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mental attitude. There had been a little pause, during
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes; and with a sudden break into a
smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were as kind to you as you are to me, that would spoil your
generosity: it would no longer be as great as it could be--and it is
that now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I am not to ask for one kiss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, contented to pay
a large price for this new kind of love-making, which introduced
marriage by the finest contrast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, getting saucy, and nodding at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) defiantly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) little left hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lips, and then released it
respectfully. Clearly it was faint praise to say of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was not
disgusting: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was almost charming; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt at this moment that it
was not likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could ever have loved another man better than this
one. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reticence gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) some inexplicable, delightful consciousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apropos,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) work again, <div class="bookquote">``is there any one
besides Captain and Mrs. Torrington at Diplow?--or do you leave them
_tete-à-tete_? I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) converses in cigars, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) answers with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) chignon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) has a sister with her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) shadow of a
smile, <div class="bookquote">``and there are two men besides--one of them you know, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then, I have a poor opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) at Leubronn--young Deronda--a young fellow with the
Mallingers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart were making a sudden gambol, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
fingers, which tried to keep a firm hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) work, got cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, dreading any discernible change in
herself. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) not disagreeable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not particularly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) most languid way. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
thinks a little too much of himself. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been introduced
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Some one told me his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) name the evening before I came away. That was
all. What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sort of ward of Sir Hugo Mallinger's. Nothing of any consequence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, poor creature! How very unpleasant for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
speaking from the lip, and not meaning any sarcasm. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder if it has
left off raining!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) added, rising and going to look out of the
window.

<p/>Happily it did not rain the next day, and Gwendolen rode to Diplow on
Criterion as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had done on that former day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) returned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mother in the carriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) always felt the more daring for being in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) riding-dress; besides having the agreeable belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked
as well as possible in it--a sustaining consciousness in any meeting
which seems formidable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) anger toward Deronda had changed into a
superstitious dread--due, perhaps, to the coercion he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had exercised
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought--lest the first interference of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life might
foreshadow some future influence. It is of such stuff that
superstitions are commonly made: an intense feeling about ourselves
which makes the evening star shine at us with a threat, and the
blessing of a beggar encourage us. And superstitions carry consequences
which often verify their hope or their foreboding.

<p/>The time before luncheon was taken up for Gwendolen by going over the
rooms with Mrs. Torrington and Mrs. Davilow; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) thought it likely
that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) saw Deronda, there would hardly be need for more than a bow
between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) meant to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as little as possible.

<p/>And after all she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) found herself under an inward compulsion too strong
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) pride. From the first moment of their being in the room
together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) seemed to herself to be doing nothing but notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>);
everything else was automatic performance of an habitual part.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) place at lunch, Grandcourt had said, <div class="bookquote">``Deronda, Miss
Harleth tells me you were not introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) at Leubronn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Harleth hardly remembers me, I imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) quite simply, as they bowed. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>) was intensely occupied when I saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harleth</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had not suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) of being the person
who redeemed her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) necklace?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary. I remember you very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, feeling
rather nervous, but governing herself and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in return with
new examination. <div class="bookquote">``You did not approve of my playing at roulette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you come to that conclusion?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you cast an evil eye on my play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a turn of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head and a smile. <div class="bookquote">``I began to lose as soon as you came to look on.
I had always been winning till then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Roulette in such a kennel as Leubronn is a horrid bore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ found it a bore when I began to lose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face
was turned toward Grandcourt as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) smiled and spoke, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gave a
sidelong glance at Deronda, and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with a look
so gravely penetrating that it had a keener edge for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) than his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
ironical smile at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) losses--a keener edge than Klesmer's judgment.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wheeled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck round as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wanted to listen to what was being
said by the rest, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was only thinking of Deronda. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face had
that disturbing kind of form and expression which threatens to affect
opinion--as if one's standard was somehow wrong. -LRB-Who has not seen men
with faces of this corrective power till they frustrated it by speech
or action?-RRB- His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) voice, heard now for the first time, was to
Grandcourt's toneless drawl, which had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ears every day, as
the deep notes of a violoncello to the broken discourse of poultry and
other lazy gentry in the afternoon sunshine. Grandcourt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) inwardly
conjectured, was perhaps right in saying that Deronda thought too much
of himself:--a favorite way of explaining a superiority that
humiliates. However the talk turned on the rinderpest and Jamaica, and
no more was said about roulette. Grandcourt held that the Jamaica negro
was a beastly sort of baptist Caliban; Deronda said he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had always felt
a little with Caliban, who naturally had his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own point of view and
could sing a good song; Mrs. Davilow observed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) father had an
estate in Barbadoes, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) herself had never been in the West
Indies; Mrs. Torrington was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) should never sleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) bed if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) lived among blacks; her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) husband corrected her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) by saying that the
blacks would be manageable enough if it were not for the half-breeds;
and Deronda remarked that the whites had to thank themselves for the
half-breeds.

<p/>While this polite pea-shooting was going on, Gwendolen trifled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
jelly, and looked at every speaker in turn that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might feel at ease
in looking at Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thinks of me, really? He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must have felt interested in
me, else he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would not have sent me my necklace. I wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thinks
of my marriage? What notions has he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to make him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) so grave about things?
Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) come to Diplow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>These questions ran in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind as the voice of an uneasy longing to be
judged by Deronda with unmixed admiration--a longing which had had its
seed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) first resentment at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) critical glance. Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) care
so much about the opinion of this man who was <div class="bookquote">``nothing of any
consequence'' (<font color='red'><b>this man nothing</b></font>)</div>? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had no time to find the reason--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was too much
engaged in caring. In the drawing-room, when something had called
Grandcourt away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went quite unpremeditatedly up to Deronda, who was
standing at a table apart, turning over some prints, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you hunt to-morrow, Mr. Deronda?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I believe so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't object to hunting, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I find excuses for it. It is a sin I am inclined to--when I can't get
boating or cricketing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you object to my hunting?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a saucy movement of
the chin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no right to object to anything you choose to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You thought you had a right to object to my gambling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>persisted
Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sorry for it. I am not aware that I told you of my objection,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) usual directness of gaze--a large-eyed gravity,
innocent of any intention. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes had a peculiarity which has drawn
many men into trouble; they were of a dark yet mild intensity which
seemed to express a special interest in every one on whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) fixed
them, and might easily help to bring on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) those claims which ardently
sympathetic people are often creating in the minds of those who need
help. In mendicant fashion we make the goodness of others a reason for
exorbitant demands on them. That sort of effect was penetrating
Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You hindered me from gambling again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) answered. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had no
sooner spoken than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) blushed over face and neck; and Deronda blushed,
too, conscious that in the little affair of the necklace he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had taken a
questionable freedom.

<p/>It was impossible to speak further; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned away to a window,
feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had stupidly said what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not meant to say, and
yet being rather happy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had plunged into this mutual
understanding. Deronda also did not like it. Gwendolen seemed more
decidedly attractive than before; and certainly there had been changes
going on within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) since that time at Leubronn: the struggle of mind
attending a conscious error had wakened something like a new soul,
which had better, but also worse, possibilities than her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) former poise
of crude self-confidence: among the forces she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had come to dread was
something within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that troubled satisfaction.

<p/>That evening Mrs. Davilow said, <div class="bookquote">``Was it really so, or only a joke of
yours, about Mr. Deronda's spoiling your play, Gwen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) curiosity had been excited, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) could venture to ask a question
that did not concern Mr. Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it merely happened that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was looking on when I began to lose,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``I noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wonder at that: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is a striking young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) puts me in mind
of Italian paintings. One would guess, without being told, that there
was foreign blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) veins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Torrington says so. I asked particularly who he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) told
me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother was some foreigner of high rank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, rather sharply. <div class="bookquote">``Then who was his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--every one says he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is the son of Sir Hugo Mallinger, who brought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) up; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) passes for a ward. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says, if Sir Hugo Mallinger
could have done as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) liked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) estates, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) would have left them
to this Mr. Deronda, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) has no legitimate son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen was silent; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother observed so marked an effect in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was angry with herself for having repeated Mrs.
Torrington's gossip. It seemed, on reflection, unsuited to the ear of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) daughter, for whom Mrs. Davilow disliked what is called knowledge
of the world; and indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) herself had not had any of
it thrust upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>).

<p/>An image which had immediately arisen in Gwendolen's mind was that of
the unknown mother--no doubt a dark-eyed woman--probably sad. Hardly
any face could be less like Deronda's than that represented as Sir
Hugo's in a crayon portrait at Diplow. A dark-eyed woman, no longer
young, had become <div class="bookquote">``stuff o' the conscience''  (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div>to Gwendolen.

<p/>That night when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had got into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) little bed, and only a dim light
was burning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, have men generally children before they are married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you ask such a question?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-But she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) began to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) saw the why.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it were so, I ought to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with some indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are thinking of what I said about Mr. Deronda and Sir Hugo
Mallinger. That is a very unusual case, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Lady Mallinger know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) knows enough to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>). That is quite clear, because Mr.
Deronda has lived with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And people think no worse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is under some disadvantage: it is not as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) were
Lady Mallinger's son. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) does not inherit the property, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is not
of any consequence in the world. But people are not obliged to know
anything about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) birth; you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is very well received.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) knows about it; and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is angry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, why should you think of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, impetuously, sitting up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) bed. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't
children reason to be angry with their parents? How can they help their
parents marrying or not marrying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>But a consciousness rushed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fall back again on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pillow. It was not only what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have felt months
before--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might seem to be reproaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother for that
second marriage of hers; what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chiefly felt now was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
been led on to a condemnation which seemed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own marriage a
forbidden thing.

<p/>There was no further talk, and till sleep came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) Gwendolen lay
struggling with the reasons against that marriage--reasons which
pressed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) newly now that they were unexpectedly mirrored in the
story of a man whose slight relations with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had, by some hidden
affinity, bitten themselves into the most permanent layers of feeling.
It was characteristic that, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) debating, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was never
troubled by the question whether the indefensibleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) marriage
did not include the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had accepted Grandcourt solely as a
man whom it was convenient for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to marry, not in the least as one to
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would be binding herself in duty. Gwendolen's ideas were
pitiably crude; but many grand difficulties of life are apt to force
themselves on us in our crudity. And to judge wisely, I suppose we must
know how things appear to the unwise; that kind of appearance making
the larger part of the world's history.

<p/>In the morning there was a double excitement for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was going to
hunt, from which scruples about propriety had threatened to hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
until it was found that Mrs. Torrington was horsewoman enough to
accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>)--going to hunt for the first time since her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) escapade with
Rex; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) was going again to see Deronda, in whom, since last night,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) interest had so gathered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) expected, as people do about
revealed celebrities, to see something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) appearance which she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) had
missed before.

<p/>What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) going to be? What sort of life had he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) being
nothing of any consequence? And with only a little difference in events
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might have been as important as Grandcourt, nay--her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) imagination
inevitably went into that direction--might have held the very estates
which Grandcourt was to have. But now, Deronda would probably some day
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) mistress of the Abbey at Topping, see her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrington</b></font>) bearing the title
which would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own wife's. These obvious, futile thoughts of
what might have been, made a new epoch for Gwendolen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), whose
unquestionable habit it had been to take the best that came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) for
less than her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own claim, had now to see the position which tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
in a new light, as a hard, unfair exclusion of others. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had now
heard about Deronda seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination to throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) into one
group with Mrs. Glasher and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) children; before whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) felt herself
in an attitude of apology--she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) who had hitherto been surrounded by a
group that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) opinion had need be apologetic to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>). Perhaps
Deronda himself was thinking of these things. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) know of Mrs.
Glasher? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could
have no such knowledge. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), without that, despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) for
marrying Grandcourt? His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) possible judgment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) actions was telling
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) as importunately as Klesmer's judgment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) powers; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
found larger room for resistance to a disapproval of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) marriage,
because it is easier to make our conduct seem justifiable to ourselves
than to make our ability strike others. <div class="bookquote">``How can I help it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is not our
favorite apology for incompetency. But Gwendolen felt some strength in
saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I help what other people have done? Things would not come
right if I were to turn round now and declare that I would not marry
Mr. Grandcourt.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>And such turning round was out of the question. The
horses in the chariot she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had mounted were going at full speed.

<p/>This mood of youthful, elated desperation had a tidal recurrence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could dare anything that lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sooner than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could choose to
go backward, into humiliation; and it was even soothing to think that
there would now be as much ill-doing in the one as in the other. But
the immediate delightful fact was the hunt, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would see
Deronda, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); for always lurking ready to
obtrude before other thoughts about him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
very much interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). But to-day she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was resolved not to repeat
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) folly of yesterday, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were anxious to say anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).
Indeed, the hunt would be too absorbing.

<p/>And so it was for a long while. Deronda was there, and within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sight
very often; but this only added to the stimulus of a pleasure which
Gwendolen had only once before tasted, and which seemed likely always
to give a delight independent of any crosses, except such as took away
the chance of riding. No accident happened to throw them together; the
run took them within convenient reach of home, and the agreeable
sombreness of the gray November afternoon, with a long stratum of
yellow light in the west, Gwendolen was returning with the company from
Diplow, who were attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) on the way to Offendene. Now the sense
of glorious excitement was over and gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was getting irritably
disappointed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had had no opportunity of speaking to Deronda,
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would not see again, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was to go away in a couple of
days. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) going to say? That was not quite certain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wanted
to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). Grandcourt was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) side; Mrs. Torrington, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
husband, and another gentleman in advance; and Deronda's horse she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could hear behind. The wish to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and have him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) speaking to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was becoming imperious; and there was no chance of it unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
simply asserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) will and defied everything. Where the order of
things could give way to Miss Gwendolen, it must be made to do so. They
had lately emerged from a wood of pines and beeches, where the twilight
stillness had a repressing effect, which increased her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) impatience. The
horse-hoofs again heard behind at some little distance were a growing
irritation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) reined in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) horse and looked behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); Grandcourt
after a few paces, also paused; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) whip and nodding
sideways with playful imperiousness, said, <div class="bookquote">``Go on! I want to speak to
Mr. Deronda.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt hesitated; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would have done after any
proposition. It was an awkward situation for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). No gentleman, before
marriage; could give the emphasis of refusal to a command delivered in
this playful way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) rode on slowly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) waited till Deronda came
up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with tacit inquiry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said at once, letting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) horse go alongside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Deronda, you must enlighten my ignorance. I want to know why you
thought it wrong for me to gamble. Is it because I am a woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not altogether; but I regretted it the more because you were a woman,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with an irrepressible smile. Apparently it must be
understood between them now that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) who sent the necklace. <div class="bookquote">``I
think it would be better for men not to gamble. It is a besotting kind
of taste, likely to turn into a disease. And, besides, there is
something revolting to me in raking a heap of money together, and
internally chuckling over it, when others are feeling the loss of it. I
should even call it base, if it were more than an exceptional lapse.
There are enough inevitable turns of fortune which force us to see that
our gain is another's loss:--that is one of the ugly aspects of life.
One would like to reduce it as much as one could, not get amusement out
of exaggerating it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda's voice had gathered some indignation
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do admit that we can't help things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a
drop in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tone. The answer had not been anything like what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
expected. <div class="bookquote">``I mean that things are so in spite of us; we can't always
help it that our gain is another's loss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clearly. Because of that, we should help it where we can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen, biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lip inside, paused a moment, and then forcing
herself to speak with an air of playfulness again, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should you regret it more because I am a woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps because we need that you should be better than we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But suppose _we_ need that men should be better than we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen with a little air of <div class="bookquote">``check!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is rather a difficulty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I
should have said, we each of us think it would be better for the other
to be good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, I needed you to be better than I was--and you thought so,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, nodding and laughing, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) horse forward
and joined Grandcourt, who made no observation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you want to know what I had to say to Mr. Deronda?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, whose own pride required her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to account for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A--no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that is the first impolite word you have spoken--that you don't
wish to hear what I had to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, playing at a pout.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to hear what you say to me--not to other men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you wish to hear this. I wanted to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tell me why he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
objected to my gambling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) gave me a little sermon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--but excuse me the sermon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>If Gwendolen imagined that Grandcourt
cared about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) speaking to Deronda, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to understand that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was mistaken. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not fond of being told to ride on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was piqued, but did not mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had accomplished her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) object of
speaking again to Deronda before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hat and turned with the
rest toward Diplow, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lover attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to Offendene, where he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
was to bid farewell before a whole day's absence on the unspecified
journey. Grandcourt had spoken truth in calling the journey a bore: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
was going by train to Gadsmere.




<p/>CHAPTER XXX.

<p/>No penitence and no confessional,
No priest ordains it, yet they're forced to sit
Amid deep ashes of their vanished years.


<p/>Imagine a rambling, patchy house, the best part built of gray stone,
and red-tiled, a round tower jutting at one of the corners, the mellow
darkness of its conical roof surmounted by a weather-cock making an
agreeable object either amidst the gleams and greenth of summer or the
low-hanging clouds and snowy branches of winter: the ground shady with
spreading trees: a great tree flourishing on one side, backward some
Scotch firs on a broken bank where the roots hung naked, and beyond, a
rookery: on the other side a pool overhung with bushes, where the
water-fowl fluttered and screamed: all around, a vast meadow which
might be called a park, bordered by an old plantation and guarded by
stone ledges which looked like little prisons. Outside the gate the
country, once entirely rural and lovely, now black with coal mines, was
chiefly peopled by men and brethren with candles stuck in their hats,
and with a diabolic complexion which laid them peculiarly open to
suspicion in the eyes of the children at Gadsmere--Mrs. Glasher's four
beautiful children, who had dwelt there for about three years. Now, in
November, when the flower-beds were empty, the trees leafless, and the
pool blackly shivering, one might have said that the place was sombrely
in keeping with the black roads and black mounds which seemed to put
the district in mourning;--except when the children were playing on the
gravel with the dogs for their companions. But Mrs. Glasher, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
present circumstances, liked Gadsmere as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) would have liked
any other abode. The complete seclusion of the place, which the
unattractiveness of the country secured, was exactly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) taste. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) two ponies with a waggonet full of children, there were
no gentry in carriages to be met, only men of business in gigs; at
church there were no eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) cared to avoid, for the curate's wife and
the curate himself were either ignorant of anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
disadvantage, or ignored it: to them she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) was simply a widow lady, the
tenant of Gadsmere; and the name of Grandcourt was of little interest
in that district compared with the names of Fletcher and Gawcome, the
lessees of the collieries.

<p/>It was full ten years since the elopement of an Irish officer's
beautiful wife with young Grandcourt, and a consequent duel where the
bullets wounded the air only, had made some little noise. Most of those
who remembered the affair now wondered what had become of that Mrs.
Glasher, whose beauty and brilliancy had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) rather conspicuous to
them in foreign places, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) was known to be living with young
Grandcourt.

<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should have disentangled himself from that connection seemed
only natural and desirable. As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>), it was thought that a woman who
was understood to have forsaken her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child along with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband had
probably sunk lower. Grandcourt had of course got weary of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was
much given to the pursuit of women: but a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) position would by
this time desire to make a suitable marriage with the fair young
daughter of a noble house. No one talked of Mrs. Glasher now, any more
than they talked of the victim in a trial for manslaughter ten years
before: she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) was a lost vessel after whom nobody would send out an
expedition of search; but Grandcourt was seen in harbor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) colors
flying, registered as seaworthy as ever.

<p/>Yet, in fact, Grandcourt had never disentangled himself from Mrs.
Glasher. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) passion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had been the strongest and most lasting he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
had ever known; and though it was now as dead as the music of a cracked
flute, it had left a certain dull disposedness, which, on the death of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) husband three years before, had prompted in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a vacillating
notion of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>), in accordance with the understanding often
expressed between them during the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) first ardor. At that
early time Grandcourt would willingly have paid for the freedom to be
won by a divorce; but the husband would not oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), not wanting to
be married again himself, and not wishing to have his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) domestic habits
printed in evidence.

<p/>The altered poise which the years had brought in Mrs. Glasher was just
the reverse. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) was comparatively careless about the
possibility of marriage. It was enough that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had escaped from a
disagreeable husband and found a sort of bliss with a lover who had
completely fascinated her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)--young, handsome, amorous, and living in the
best style, with equipage and conversation of the kind to be expected
in young men of fortune who have seen everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) was an
impassioned, vivacious woman, fond of adoration, exasperated by five
years of marital rudeness; and the sense of release was so strong upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) that it stilled anxiety for more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) actually enjoyed. An
equivocal position was of no importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) then; she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had no envy
for the honors of a dull, disregarded wife: the one spot which spoiled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) new pleasant world, was the sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
three-year-old boy, who died two years afterward, and whose first tones
saying <div class="bookquote">``mamma''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>retained a difference from those of the children that
came after. But now the years had brought many changes besides those in
the contour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) cheek and throat; and that Grandcourt should marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had become her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) dominant desire. The equivocal position which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
had not minded about for herself was now telling upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
children, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) loved with a devotion charged with the added passion
of atonement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had no repentance except in this direction. If
Grandcourt married her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>), the children would be none the worse off for
what had passed: they would see their mother in a dignified position,
and they would be at no disadvantage with the world: her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son could be
made his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's heir. It was the yearning for this result which gave
the supreme importance to Grandcourt's feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) love for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had long resolved itself into anxiety that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the
unique, permanent claim of a wife, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) expected no other happiness
in marriage than the satisfaction of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) maternal love and
pride--including her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pride for herself in the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children.
For the sake of that result she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was prepared even with a tragic
firmness to endure anything quietly in marriage; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had acuteness
enough to cherish Grandcourt's flickering purpose negatively, by not
molesting him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) with passionate appeals and with scene-making. In her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), as
in every one else who wanted anything of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) incalculable turns,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) tendency to harden under beseeching, had created a reasonable
dread:--a slow discovery, of which no presentiment had been given in
the bearing of a youthful lover with a fine line of face and the
softest manners. But reticence had necessarily cost something to this
impassioned woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was the bitterer for it. There is no
quailing--even that forced on the helpless and injured--which has not
an ugly obverse: the withheld sting was gathering venom. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
absolutely dependent on Grandcourt; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had been always
liberal in expenses for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had kept everything voluntary on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
part; and with the goal of marriage before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would ask for
nothing less. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would never settle anything except by
will; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was thinking of alternatives for the future it often
occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not become Grandcourt's wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
might never have a son who would have a legitimate claim on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and
the end might be that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son would be made heir to the best part of
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) estates. No son at that early age could promise to have more of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
father's physique. But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) becoming Grandcourt's wife was so far from
being an extravagant notion of possibility, that even Lush had
entertained it, and had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would as soon bet on it as on any
other likelihood with regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) familiar companion. Lush, indeed,
on inferring that Grandcourt had a preconception of using his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) residence
at Diplow in order to win Miss Arrowpoint, had thought it well to fan
that project, taking it as a tacit renunciation of the marriage with
Mrs. Glasher, which had long been a mark for the hovering and wheeling
of Grandcourt's caprice. But both prospects had been negatived by
Gwendolen's appearance on the scene; and it was natural enough for Mrs.
Glasher to enter with eagerness into Lush's plan of hindering that new
danger by setting up a barrier in the mind of the girl who was being
sought as a bride. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) entered into it with an eagerness which had
passion in it as well as purpose, some of the stored-up venom
delivering itself in that way.

<p/>After that, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had heard from Lush of Gwendolen's departure, and the
probability that all danger from her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was got rid of; but there had been
no letter to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) that the danger had returned and had become a
certainty. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had since then written to Grandcourt, as she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) did
habitually, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had been longer than usual in answering. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was
inferring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) might intend coming to Gadsmere at the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
was actually on the way; and she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was not without hope--what
construction of another's mind is not strong wishing equal to?--that a
certain sickening from that frustrated courtship might dispose him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to
slip the more easily into the old track of intention.

<p/>Grandcourt had two grave purposes in coming to Gadsmere: to convey the
news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) approaching marriage in person, in order to make this first
difficulty final; and to get from Lydia his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mother's diamonds, which
long ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had confided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) and wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) to wear. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) person
suited diamonds, and made them look as if they were worth some of the
money given for them. These particular diamonds were not mountains of
light--they were mere peas and haricots for the ears, neck and hair;
but they were worth some thousands, and Grandcourt necessarily wished
to have them for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wife. Formerly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had asked Lydia to put them
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) keeping again, simply on the ground that they would be safer
and ought to be deposited at the bank, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had quietly but absolutely
refused, declaring that they were quite safe; and at last had said, <div class="bookquote">``If
you ever marry another woman I will give them up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): are you going
to marry another woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At that time Grandcourt had no motive which
urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to persist, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had this grace in him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), that the
disposition to exercise power either by cowing or disappointing others
or exciting in them a rage which they dared not express--a disposition
which was active in him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) as other propensities became languid--had
always been in abeyance before Lydia. A severe interpreter might say
that the mere facts of their relation to each other, the melancholy
position of this woman who depended on his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) will, made a standing
banquet for his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) delight in dominating. But there was something else
than this in his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) forbearance toward her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): there was the surviving though
metamorphosed effect of the power she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had had over him (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>); and it was this
effect, the fitful dull lapse toward solicitations that once had the
zest now missing from life, which had again and again inclined him (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) to
espouse a familiar past rather than rouse himself to the expectation of
novelty. But now novelty had taken hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) and urged him (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) to make
the most of it.

<p/>Mrs. Glasher was seated in the pleasant room where she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) habitually
passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) mornings with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) children round her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>). It had a square
projecting window and looked on broad gravel and grass, sloping toward
a little brook that entered the pool. The top of a low, black cabinet,
the old oak table, the chairs in tawny leather, were littered with the
children's toys, books and garden garments, at which a maternal lady in
pastel looked down from the walls with smiling indulgence. The children
were all there. The three girls, seated round their mother near the
widow, were miniature portraits of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)--dark-eyed, delicate-featured
brunettes with a rich bloom on their cheeks, their little nostrils and
eyebrows singularly finished as if they were tiny women, the eldest
being barely nine. The boy was seated on the carpet at some distance,
bending his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blonde head over the animals from a Noah's ark, admonishing
them separately in a voice of threatening command, and occasionally
licking the spotted ones to see if the colors would hold. Josephine,
the eldest, was having her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) French lesson; and the others, with their
dolls on their laps, sat demurely enough for images of the Madonna.
Mrs. Glasher's toilet had been made very carefully--each day now she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
said to herself that Grandcourt might come in. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) head, which, spite
of emaciation, had an ineffaceable beauty in the fine profile, crisp
curves of hair, and clearly-marked eyebrows, rose impressively above
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) bronze-colored silk and velvet, and the gold necklace which
Grandcourt had first clasped round her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) neck years ago. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had
any pleasure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) toilet; her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) chief thought of herself seen in the
glass was, <div class="bookquote">``How changed!'' (<font color='red'><b>chief</b></font>)</div>--but such good in life as remained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
would keep. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) chief wish were fulfilled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) could imagine herself
getting the comeliness of a matron fit for the highest rank. The little
faces beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>), almost exact reductions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) own, seemed to tell of
the blooming curves which had once been where now was sunken pallor.
But the children kissed the pale cheeks and never found them deficient.
That love was now the one end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) life.

<p/>Suddenly Mrs. Glasher turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) head from Josephine's book and
listened. <div class="bookquote">``Hush, dear! I think some one is coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Henleigh the boy jumped up and said, <div class="bookquote">``Mamma, is it the miller with my
donkey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got no answer, and going up to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mamma's knee repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
question in an insistent tone. But the door opened, and the servant
announced Mr. Grandcourt. Mrs. Glasher rose in some agitation. Henleigh
frowned at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) in disgust at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) not being the miller, and the three
little girls lifted up their dark eyes to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) timidly. They had none of
them any particular liking for this friend of mamma's--in fact, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had taken Mrs. Glasher's hand and then turned to put his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) other hand on
Henleigh's head, that energetic scion began to beat the friend's arm
away with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fists. The little girls submitted bashfully to be patted
under the chin and kissed, but on the whole it seemed better to send
them into the garden, where they were presently dancing and chatting
with the dogs on the gravel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How far are you come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glasher</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glasher, as Grandcourt put away his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
hat and overcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Diplow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) answered slowly, seating himself opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) and
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) with an unnoting gaze which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) noted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are tired, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I rested at the Junction--a hideous hole. These railway journeys
are always a confounded bore. But I had coffee and smoked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt drew out his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) handkerchief, rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) face, and in returning
the handkerchief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) pocket looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) crossed knee and blameless
boot, as if any stranger were opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), instead of a woman
quivering with a suspense which every word and look of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was to
incline toward hope or dread. But he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was really occupied with their
interview and what it was likely to include. Imagine the difference in
rate of emotion between this woman whom the years had worn to a more
conscious dependence and sharper eagerness, and this man whom they were
dulling into a more neutral obstinacy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expected to see you--it was so long since I had heard from you. I
suppose the weeks seem longer at Gadsmere than they do at Diplow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glasher</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Glasher. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had a quick, incisive way of speaking that seemed to
go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) features, as the tone and _timbre_ of a violin go with its
form.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>drawled Grandcourt. <div class="bookquote">``But you found the money paid into the bank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Glasher</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Glasher, curtly, tingling with impatience. Always
before--at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) fancied so--Grandcourt had taken more notice of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) and the children than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did to-day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) resumed, playing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) whisker, and at first not looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the time has gone on at rather a rattling pace with me;
generally it is slow enough. But there has been a good deal happening,
as you know'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--here he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I know?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>), sharply.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) left a pause before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, without change of manner, <div class="bookquote">``That I was
thinking of marrying. You saw Miss Harleth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_She (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)_ told you that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The pale cheeks looked even paler, perhaps from the fierce brightness
in the eyes above them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Lush told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the slow answer. It was as if the thumb-screw
and the iron boot were being placed by creeping hands within sight of
the expectant victim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God! say at once that you are going to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) burst out,
passionately, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) knees shaking and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) hands tightly clasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, this kind of thing must happen some time or other, Lydia,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>); really, now the thumb-screw was on, not wishing to make the
pain worse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't always see the necessity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. I see it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>In those few under-toned words of Grandcourt's she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) felt as absolute a
resistance as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) thin fingers had been pushing at a fast shut iron
door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) helplessness, and shrank from testing it by any
appeal--shrank from crying in a dead ear and clinging to dead knees,
only to see the immovable face and feel the rigid limbs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) did not
weep nor speak; she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) was too hard pressed by the sudden certainty which
had as much of chill sickness in it as of thought and emotion. The
defeated clutch of struggling hope gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) in these first moments a
horrible sensation. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) rose, with a spasmodic effort, and,
unconscious of every thing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) wretchedness, pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) forehead
against the hard, cold glass of the window. The children, playing on
the gravel, took this as a sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) wanted them, and, running
forward, stood in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) with their sweet faces upturned
expectantly. This roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) head at them, waved them
off, and overcome with this painful exertion, sank back in the nearest
chair.

<p/>Grandcourt had risen too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was doubly annoyed--at the scene itself,
and at the sense that no imperiousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could save him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) from it;
but the task had to be gone through, and there was the administrative
necessity of arranging things so that there should be as little
annoyance as possible in the future. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was leaning against the corner
of the fire-place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) and said, bitterly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All this is of no consequence to you. I and the children are
importunate creatures. You wish to get away again and be with Miss
Harleth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't make the affair more disagreeable than it need be. Lydia. It is
of no use to harp on things that can't be altered. Of course, its
deucedly disagreeable to me to see you making yourself miserable. I've
taken this journey to tell you what you must make up your mind to--you
and the children will be provided for as usual--and there's an end of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) dared not answer. This woman with the intense, eager look
had had the iron of the mother's anguish in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soul, and it had made
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sometimes capable of a repression harder than shrieking and
struggle. But underneath the silence there was an outlash of hatred and
vindictiveness: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wished that the marriage might make two others
wretched, besides herself. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be better for you. You may go on living here. But I think of
by-and-by settling a good sum on you and the children, and you can live
where you like. There will be nothing for you to complain of then.
Whatever happens, you will feel secure. Nothing could be done
beforehand. Every thing has gone on in a hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt ceased his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) slow delivery of sentences. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not expect her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) considered that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might reasonably be contented;
if it were possible for Lydia to be contented. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) showed no change,
and after a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have never had any reason to fear that I should be illiberal. I
don't care a curse about the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you did care about it, I suppose you would not give it us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Lydia Glasher</b></font>)</div>said
Lydia. The sarcasm was irrepressible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a devilishly unfair thing to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>Grandcourt replied, in a
lower tone; <div class="bookquote">``and I advise you not to say that sort of thing again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you punish me by leaving the children in beggary?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In spite of
herself, the one outlet of venom had brought the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no question about leaving the children in beggary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt, still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) low voice. <div class="bookquote">``I advise you not to say things
that you will repent of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am used to repenting,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you will repent.
You have already repented of loving me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All this will only make it uncommonly difficult for us to meet again.
What friend have you besides me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The words came like a low moan. At the same moment there flashed
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) the wish that after promising himself a better happiness
than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had had with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) might feel a misery and loneliness
which would drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) to find some memory of a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
was young, glad, and hopeful. But no! he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would go scathless; it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
that had to suffer.

<p/>With this the scorching words were ended. Grandcourt had meant to stay
till evening; he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wished to curtail his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) visit, but there was no suitable
train earlier than the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had arranged to go by, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had still
to speak to Lydia on the second object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) visit, which like a
second surgical operation seemed to require an interval. The hours had
to go by; there was eating to be done; the children came in--all this
mechanism of life had to be gone through with the dreary sense of
constraint which is often felt in domestic quarrels of a commoner kind.
To Lydia it was some slight relief for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) stifled fury to have the
children present: she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) felt a savage glory in their loveliness, as if it
would taunt Grandcourt with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) indifference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) and them--a secret
darting of venom which was strongly imaginative. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) acquitted himself
with all the advantage of a man whose grace of bearing has long been
moulded on an experience of boredom--nursed the little Antonia, who sat
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Antonia</b></font>) hands crossed and eyes upturned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) bald head, which struck
her (<font color='blue'><b>Antonia</b></font>) as worthy of observation--and propitiated Henleigh by promising him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
a beautiful saddle and bridle. It was only the two eldest girls who had
known him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) as a continual presence; and the intervening years had
overlaid their infantine memories with a bashfulness which Grandcourt's
bearing was not likely to dissipate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) and Lydia occasionally, in the
presence of the servants, made a conventional remark; otherwise they
never spoke; and the stagnant thought in Grandcourt's mind all the
while was of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own infatuation in having given her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) those diamonds,
which obliged him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to incur the nuisance of speaking about them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had
an ingrained care for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) held to belong to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) caste, and about
property he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) liked to be lordly; also he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had a consciousness of
indignity to himself in having to ask for anything in the world. But
however he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) might assert his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) independence of Mrs. Glasher's past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had
made a past for himself which was a stronger yoke than any he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could
impose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) must ask for the diamonds which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had promised to Gwendolen.

<p/>At last they were alone again, with the candles above them, face to
face with each other. Grandcourt looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) watch, and then said, in
an apparently indifferent drawl, <div class="bookquote">``There is one thing I had to mention,
Lydia. My diamonds--you have them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) answered promptly, rising and standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
arms thrust down and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fingers threaded, while Grandcourt sat still.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had expected the topic, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resolve about it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
meant to carry out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resolve, if possible, without exasperating him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).
During the hours of silence she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had longed to recall the words which
had only widened the breach between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are in this house, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not in this house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you said you kept them by you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I said so it was true. They are in the bank at Dudley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get them away, will you? I must make an arrangement for your
delivering them to some one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make no arrangement. They shall be delivered to the person you
intended them for. _I_ will make the arrangement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I say. I have always told you that I would give them up to your
wife. I shall keep my word. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is not your wife yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is foolery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, with undertoned disgust. It was too
irritating that this indulgence of Lydia had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) a sort of
mastery over him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) in spite of dependent condition.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) did not speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) also rose now, but stood leaning against the
mantle-piece with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) side-face toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The diamonds must be delivered to me before my marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) began
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your wedding-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The tenth. There is no time to be lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where do you go after the marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not reply except by looking more sullen. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You
must appoint a day before then, to get them from the bank and meet
me--or somebody else I will commission;--it's a great nuisance, Mention
a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I shall not do that. They shall be delivered to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) safely. I
shall keep my word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, just audibly, turning to face
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that you will not do as I tell you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I mean that,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was the answer that leaped out, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) eyes
flashed close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). The poor creature was immediately conscious that
if her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) words had any effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) own lot, the effect must be
mischievous, and might nullify all the remaining advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) long
patience. But the word had been spoken.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was in a position the most irritating to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could not shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
nor touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) hostilely; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could, the process would not bring
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mother's diamonds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) shrank from the only sort of threat that
would frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) believed it. And in general, there was
nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hated more than to be forced into anything like violence
even in words: his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) will must impose itself without trouble. After
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) for a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) side-face toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) again,
leaning as before, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Infernal idiots that women are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why will you not tell me where you are going after the marriage? I
could be at the wedding if I liked, and learn in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Lydia Glasher</b></font>)</div>said Lydia,
not shrinking from the one suicidal form of threat within her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) power.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, if you like, you can play the mad woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt,
with _sotto voce_ scorn. <div class="bookquote">``It is not to be supposed that you will wait
to think what good will come of it--or what you owe to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was in a state of disgust and embitterment quite new in the history
of their relation to each other. It was undeniable that this woman,
whose life he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had allowed to send such deep suckers into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), had a
terrible power of annoyance in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and the rash hurry of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
proceedings had left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opportunities open. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) pride saw very ugly
possibilities threatening it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) stood for several minutes in
silence reviewing the situation--considering how he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could act upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
Unlike himself she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was of a direct nature, with certain simple
strongly-colored tendencies, and there was one often-experienced effect
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could count upon now. As Sir Hugo had said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>),
Grandcourt knew how to play his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cards upon occasion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not speak again, but looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) watch, rang the bell, and
ordered the vehicle to be brought round immediately. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) removed
farther from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), walked as if in expectation of a summons, and
remained silent without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was suffering the horrible conflict of self-reproach and tenacity.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw beforehand Grandcourt leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) without even looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
again--herself left behind in lonely uncertainty--hearing nothing from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)--not knowing whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children harm--feeling that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had perhaps made him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hate her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>);--all the wretchedness of a creature
who had defeated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own motives. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not bear to give up
a purpose which was a sweet morsel to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vindictiveness. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
not been a mother she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would willingly have sacrificed herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
revenge--to what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt to be the justice of hindering another from
getting happiness by willingly giving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) over to misery. The two
dominant passions were at struggle. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must satisfy them both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us part in anger, Henleigh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began, without changing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
voice or attitude: <div class="bookquote">``it is a very little thing I ask. If I were refusing
to give anything up that you call yours it would be different: that
would be a reason for treating me as if you hated me. But I ask such a
little thing. If you will tell me where you are going on the
wedding-day I will take care that the diamonds shall be delivered to
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) without scandal. Without scandal,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) repeated entreatingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such preposterous whims make a woman odious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, not
giving way in look or movement. <div class="bookquote">``What is the use of talking to mad
people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am foolish--loneliness has made me foolish--indulge me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Sobs
rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``If you will indulge me in this one folly I will be
very meek--I will never trouble you.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) burst into hysterical crying,
and said again almost with a scream--<div class="bookquote">``I will be very meek after that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a scream</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a strange mixture of acting and reality in this passion. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
kept hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) purpose as a child might tighten its hand over a small
stolen thing, crying and denying all the while. Even Grandcourt was
wrought upon by surprise: this capricious wish, this childish violence,
was as unlike Lydia's bearing as it was incongruous with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) person.
Both had always had a stamp of dignity on them. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) seemed more
manageable in this state than in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) former attitude of defiance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
came close up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) again, and said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) low imperious tone, <div class="bookquote">``Be
quiet, and hear what I tell you, I will never forgive you if you
present yourself again and make a scene.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) handkerchief against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) face, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could speak
firmly said, in the muffled voice that follows sobbing, <div class="bookquote">``I will not--if
you will let me have my way--I promise you not to thrust myself forward
again. I have never broken my word to you--how many have you broken to
me? When you gave me the diamonds to wear you were not thinking of
having another wife. And I now give them up--I don't reproach you--I
only ask you to let me give them up in my own way. Have I not borne it
well? Everything is to be taken away from me, and when I ask for a
straw, a chip--you deny it me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had spoken rapidly, but after a
little pause she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) said more slowly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) voice freed from its muffled
tone: <div class="bookquote">``I will not bear to have it denied me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt had a baffling sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had to deal with something like
madness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could only govern by giving way. The servant came to say
the fly was ready. When the door was shut again Grandcourt said
sullenly, <div class="bookquote">``We are going to Ryelands then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They shall be delivered to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Lydia Glasher</b></font>)</div>said Lydia, with decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, I am going.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) felt no inclination even to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) hand:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) too sorely. But now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) point,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was prepared to humble herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) might propitiate him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me; I will never vex you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) said, with beseeching
looks. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) inward voice said distinctly--<div class="bookquote">``It is only I who have to
forgive.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was obliged to ask forgiveness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better keep that promise. You have made me feel uncommonly ill
with your folly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, apparently choosing this statement
as the strongest possible use of language.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Lydia Glasher</b></font>)</div>cried Lydia, with a faint smile;--was he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) aware of the
minor fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) feel ill this morning?

<p/>But with the quick transition natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was now ready to coax
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), that they might part in some degree
reconciled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) ventured to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) shoulder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did
not move away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had so far succeeded in alarming him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was not sorry for these proofs of returned subjection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Light a cigar,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) said, soothingly, taking the case from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
breast-pocket and opening it.

<p/>Amidst such caressing signs of mutual fear they parted. The effect that
clung and gnawed within Grandcourt was a sense of imperfect mastery.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A wild dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undreamed shores.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Shakespeare/SHAKESPEARE</b></font>)</div>--SHAKESPEARE.


<p/>On the day when Gwendolen Harleth was married and became Mrs.
Grandcourt, the morning was clear and bright, and while the sun was low
a slight frost crisped the leaves. The bridal party was worth seeing,
and half Pennicote turned out to see it, lining the pathway up to the
church. An old friend of the rector's performed the marriage ceremony,
the rector himself acting as father, to the great advantage of the
procession. Only two faces, it was remarked, showed signs of
sadness--Mrs. Davilow's and Anna's. The mother's delicate eyelids were
pink, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been crying half the night; and no one was
surprised that, splendid as the match was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should feel the parting
from a daughter who was the flower of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) children and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own life.
It was less understood why Anna should be troubled when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was being
so well set off by the bridesmaid's dress. Every one else seemed to
reflect the brilliancy of the occasion--the bride most of all. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
it was agreed that as to figure and carriage she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was worthy to be a
<div class="bookquote">``lady o' title'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>: as to face, perhaps it might be thought that a title
required something more rosy; but the bridegroom himself not being
fresh-colored--being indeed, as the miller's wife observed, very much
of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own husband's complexion--the match was the more complete.
Anyhow he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must be very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and it was to be hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
would never cast it up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been going out to service as
a governess, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother to live at Sawyer's Cottage--vicissitudes
which had been much spoken of in the village. The miller's daughter of
fourteen could not believe that high gentry behaved badly to their
wives, but her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother instructed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``Oh, child, men's men: gentle or
simple, they're much of a muchness. I've heard my mother say Squire
Pelton used to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) dogs and a long whip into his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife's room, and
flog 'em there to frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and my mother was lady's-maid there at
the very time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's unlucky talk for a wedding, Mrs. Girdle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tailor</b></font>)</div>said the tailor. <div class="bookquote">``A
quarrel may end wi' the whip, but it begins wi' the tongue, and it's
the women have got the most o' that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Lord gave it 'em to use, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Girdle. <div class="bookquote">''_He (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>)_ never
meant you to have it all your own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By what I can make out from the gentleman as attends to the grooming
at Offendene,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tailor Grandcourt</b></font>)</div>said the tailor, <div class="bookquote">``this Mr. Grandcourt has wonderful
little tongue. Everything must be done dummy-like without his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) ordering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the tailor Grandcourt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)'s the more whip, I doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Girdle. <div class="bookquote">''_She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s_ got
tongue enough, I warrant her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). See, there they come out together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What wonderful long corners she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s got to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes!''  (<font color='red'><b>the tailor</b></font>)</div>said the tailor.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) makes you feel comical when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looks at you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen, in fact, never showed more elasticity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) bearing, more
lustre in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) long brown glance: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had the brilliancy of strong
excitement, which will sometimes come even from pain. It was not pain,
however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was feeling: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had wrought herself up to much the
same condition as that in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stood at the gambling-table when
Deronda was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began to lose. There was an
enjoyment in it: whatever uneasiness a growing conscience had created
was disregarded as an ailment might have been, amidst the gratification
of that ambitious vanity and desire for luxury within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) which it
would take a great deal of slow poisoning to kill. This morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could not have said truly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) repented her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) acceptance of
Grandcourt, or that any fears in hazy perspective could hinder the
glowing effect of the immediate scene in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was the central
object. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was doing something wrong--that a punishment might be
hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--that the woman to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had given a promise and
broken it, was thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in bitterness and misery with a just
reproach--that Deronda with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) way of looking into things very likely
despised her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) for marrying Grandcourt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had despised her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) for
gambling--above all, that the cord which united her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with this lover and
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had heretofore held by the hand, was now being flung over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
neck,--all this yeasty mingling of dimly understood facts with vague
but deep impressions, and with images half real, half fantastic, had
been disturbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) during the weeks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) engagement. Was that
agitating experience nullified this morning? No: it was surmounted and
thrust down with a sort of exulting defiance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt herself
standing at the game of life with many eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), daring everything
to win much--or if to lose, still with _éclat_ and a sense of
importance. But this morning a losing destiny for herself did not press
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as a fear: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was entering on a fuller power
of managing circumstances--with all the official strength of marriage,
which some women made so poor a use of. That intoxication of youthful
egoism out of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been shaken by trouble, humiliation, and a
new sense of culpability, had returned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) under a newly-fed
strength of the old fumes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not in the least present the ideal
of the tearful, tremulous bride. Poor Gwendolen, whom some had judged
much too forward and instructed in the world's ways!--with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) erect
head and elastic footstep she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was walking among illusions; and yet,
too, there was an under-consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was a little
intoxicated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God you bear it so well, my darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) had helped Gwendolen to doff her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) bridal white and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
traveling dress. All the trembling had been done by the poor mother,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) agitation urged Gwendolen doubly to take the morning as if it
were a triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you might have said that, if I had been going to Mrs. Mompert's,
you dear, sad, incorrigible mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen just putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's cheeks with laughing tenderness--then retreating
a little and spreading out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arms as if to exhibit herself: <div class="bookquote">``Here am
I--Mrs. Grandcourt! what else would you have me, but what I am sure to
be? You know you were ready to die with vexation when you thought that
I would not be Mrs. Grandcourt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush, my child, for heaven's sake!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, almost in
a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``How can I help feeling it when I am parting from you. But I
can bear anything gladly if you are happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not gladly, mamma, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head, with a
bright smile. <div class="bookquote">``Willingly you would bear it, but always sorrowfully.
Sorrowing is your sauce; you can take nothing without it.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Then,
clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's shoulders and raining kisses first on one cheek
and then on the other between her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, gaily, <div class="bookquote">``And you
shall sorrow over my having everything at my beck--and enjoying
everything glorious--splendid houses--and horses--and diamonds, I shall
have diamonds--and going to court--and being Lady Certainly--and Lady
Perhaps--and grand here--and tantivy there--and always loving you
better than anybody else in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sweet child!--But I shall not be jealous if you love your husband
better; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will expect to be first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen thrust out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips and chin with a pretty grimace, saying,
<div class="bookquote">``Rather a ridiculous expectation. However, I don't mean to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
ill, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deserves it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the two fell into a clinging embrace, and Gwendolen could not
hinder a rising sob when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you were going with me,
mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But the slight dew on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) long eyelashes only made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) the more
charming when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand to Grandcourt to be led to the carriage.

<p/>The rector looked in on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to give a final <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye; God bless you;
we shall see you again before long,''  (<font color='red'><b>The rector</b></font>)</div>and then returned to Mrs. Davilow,
saying half cheerfully, half solemnly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us be thankful, Fanny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is in a position well suited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
and beyond what I should have dared to hope for. And few women can have
been chosen more entirely for their own sake. You should feel yourself
a happy mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>There was a railway journey of some fifty miles before the new husband
and wife reached the station near Ryelands. The sky had veiled itself
since the morning, and it was hardly more than twilight when they
entered the park-gates, but still Gwendolen, looking out of the
carriage-window as they drove rapidly along, could see the grand
outlines and the nearer beauties of the scene--the long winding drive
bordered with evergreens backed by huge gray stems: then the opening of
wide grassy spaces and undulations studded with dark clumps; till at
last came a wide level where the white house could be seen, with a
hanging wood for a back-ground, and the rising and sinking balustrade
of a terrace in front.

<p/>Gwendolen had been at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) liveliest during the journey, chatting
incessantly, ignoring any change in their mutual position since
yesterday; and Grandcourt had been rather ecstatically quiescent, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) gentle seizure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand into a grasp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hand by
both hers, with an increased vivacity as of a kitten that will not sit
quiet to be petted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was really getting somewhat febrile in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
excitement; and now in this drive through the park her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) usual
susceptibility to changes of light and scenery helped to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart
palpitate newly. Was it at the novelty simply, or the almost incredible
fulfilment about to be given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) girlish dreams of being
<div class="bookquote">``somebody'' (<font color='red'><b>Zephyrs</b></font>)</div>--walking through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own furlong of corridor and under her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
own ceilings of an out-of-sight loftiness, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own painted Spring
was shedding painted flowers, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own fore-shortened Zephyrs were
blowing their trumpets over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); while her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own servants, lackeys in
clothing but men in bulk and shape, were as nought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) presence, and
revered the propriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) insolence to them:--being in short the
heroine of an admired play without the pains of art? Was it alone the
closeness of this fulfilment which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart flutter? or was it
some dim forecast, the insistent penetration of suppressed experience,
mixing the expectation of a triumph with the dread of a crisis? Hers
was one of the natures in which exultation inevitably carries an
infusion of dread ready to curdle and declare itself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fell silent in spite of herself as they approached the gates, and
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband said, <div class="bookquote">``Here we are at home!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>and for the first time
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) on the lips, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hardly knew of it: it was no more than the
passive acceptance of a greeting in the midst of an absorbing show. Was
not all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hurrying life of the last three months a show, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
consciousness was a wondering spectator? After the half-willful
excitement of the day, a numbness had come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) personality.

<p/>But there was a brilliant light in the hall--warmth, matting, carpets,
full-length portraits, Olympian statues, assiduous servants. Not many
servants, however: only a few from Diplow in addition to those
constantly in charge of the house; and Gwendolen's new maid, who had
come with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), was taken under guidance by the housekeeper. Gwendolen
felt herself being led by Grandcourt along a subtly-scented corridor,
into an ante-room where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw an open doorway sending out a rich glow
of light and color.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are our dens,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt. <div class="bookquote">``You will like to be quiet here
till dinner. We shall dine early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lips and moved away, more in love than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
had ever expected to be.

<p/>Gwendolen, yielded up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hat and mantle, threw herself into a chair by
the glowing hearth, and saw herself repeated in glass panels with all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) faint-green satin surroundings. The housekeeper had passed into
this boudoir from the adjoining dressing-room and seemed disposed to
linger, Gwendolen thought, in order to look at the new mistress of
Ryelands, who, however, being impatient for solitude said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Will
you tell Hudson when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has put out my dress to leave everything? I
shall not want her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again, unless I ring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The housekeeper, coming forward, said, <div class="bookquote">``Here is a packet, madam, which
I was ordered to give into nobody's hands but yours, when you were
alone. The person who brought it said it was a present particularly
ordered by Mr. Grandcourt; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was not to know of its arrival till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) saw you wear it. Excuse me, madam; I felt it right to obey orders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen took the packet and let it lie on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lap till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heard the
doors close. It came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind that the packet might contain the
diamonds which Grandcourt had spoken of as being deposited somewhere
and to be given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) marriage. In this moment of confused
feeling and creeping luxurious languor she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was glad of this
diversion--glad of such an event as having her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own diamonds to try on.

<p/>Within all the sealed paper coverings was a box, but within the box
there _was_ a jewel-case; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had the
diamonds. But on opening the case, in the same instant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw
them gleam she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw a letter lying above them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew the handwriting
of the address. It was as if an adder had lain on them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart gave
a leap which seemed to have spent all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) strength; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) opened
the bit of thin paper, it shook with the trembling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands. But it
was legible as print, and thrust its words upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/>These diamonds, which were once given with ardent love to Lydia
Glasher, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) passes on to you. You have broken your word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>), that
you might possess what was hers. Perhaps you think of being happy, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) once was, and of having beautiful children such as hers, who will
thrust hers aside. God is too just for that. The man you have married
has a withered heart. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best young love was mine: you could not take
that from me when you took the rest. It is dead: but I am the grave
in which your chance of happiness is buried as well as mine. You had
your warning. You have chosen to injure me and my children. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
meant to marry me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have married me at last, if you had not
broken your word. You will have your punishment. I desire it with all
my soul.

<p/>Will you give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) this letter to set him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) against me and ruin us
more--me and my children? Shall you like to stand before your husband
with these diamonds on you, and these words of mine in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thoughts and
yours? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) think you have any right to complain when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has made
you miserable? You took him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with your eyes open. The willing wrong you
have done me will be your curse.

<p/>It seemed at first as if Gwendolen's eyes were spell-bound in reading
the horrible words of the letter over and over again as a doom of
penance; but suddenly a new spasm of terror made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lean forward and
stretch out the paper toward the fire, lest accusation and proof at
once should meet all eyes. It flew like a feather from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) trembling
fingers and was caught up in a great draught of flame. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) movement
the casket fell on the floor and the diamonds rolled out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) took no
notice, but fell back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chair again helpless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not see
the reflections of herself then; they were like so many women petrified
white; but coming near herself you might have seen the tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
lips and hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sat so for a long while, knowing little more than
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was feeling ill, and that those written words kept repeating
themselves to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/>Truly here were poisoned gems, and the poison had entered into this
poor young creature.

<p/>After that long while, there was a tap at the door and Grandcourt
entered, dressed for dinner. The sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) brought a new nervous
shock, and Gwendolen screamed again and again with hysterical violence.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had expected to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dressed and smiling, ready to be led down.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pallid, shrieking as it seemed with terror, the jewels
scattered around her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) on the floor. Was it a fit of madness?

<p/>In some form or other the furies had crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) threshold.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXII.

<p/>In all ages it hath been a favorite text that a potent love hath the
nature of an isolated fatality, whereto the mind's opinions and wonted
resolves are altogether alien; as, for example, Daphnis his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) frenzy,
wherein it had little availed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to have been convinced of Heraclitus
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) doctrine; or the philtre-bred passion of Tristan, who, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristan</b></font>)
had been as deep as Duns Scotus, would have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristan</b></font>) reasoning marred
by that cup too much; or Romeo in his (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) sudden taking for Juliet,
wherein any objections he (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) might have held against Ptolemy had made
little difference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) discourse under the balcony. Yet all love is
not such, even though potent; nay, this passion hath as large scope as
any for allying itself with every operation of the soul: so that it
shall acknowledge an effect from the imagined light of unproven
firmaments, and have its scale set to the grander orbits of what hath
been and shall be.


<p/>Deronda, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) return to town, could assure Sir Hugo of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) having
lodged in Grandcourt's mind a distinct understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could get
fifty thousand pounds by giving up a prospect which was probably
distant, and not absolutely certain; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had no further sign of
Grandcourt's disposition in the matter than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was evidently
inclined to keep up friendly communications.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did you think of the future bride on a nearer survey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Sir Hugo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought better of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) than I did in Leubronn. Roulette was not a
good setting for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>); it brought out something of the demon. At Diplow
she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) seemed much more womanly and attractive--less hard and
self-possessed. I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mouth and eyes had quite a different
expression.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't flirt with her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) too much, Dan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, meaning to be
agreeably playful. <div class="bookquote">``If you make Grandcourt savage when they come to the
Abbey at Christmas, it will interfere with my affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can stay in town, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. Lady Mallinger and the children can't do without you at
Christmas. Only don't make mischief--unless you can get up a duel, and
manage to shoot Grandcourt, which might be worth a little
inconvenience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you ever saw me flirt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, not amused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, haven't I, though?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, provokingly. <div class="bookquote">``You are always
looking tenderly at the women, and talking to them in a Jesuitical way.
You are a dangerous young fellow--a kind of Lovelace who will make the
Clarissas run after you instead of you running after them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>What was the use of being exasperated at a tasteless joke?--only the
exasperation comes before the reflection on utility. Few friendly
remarks are more annoying than the information that we are always
seeming to do what we never mean to do. Sir Hugo's notion of flirting,
it was to be hoped, was rather peculiar; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) own part, Deronda was
sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had never flirted. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was glad that the baronet had no
knowledge about the repurchase of Gwendolen's necklace to feed his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
taste for this kind of rallying.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) guard in future; for example, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) behavior at
Mrs. Meyrick's, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was about to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) first visit since his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
arrival from Leubronn. For Mirah was certainly a creature in whom it
was difficult not to show a tender kind of interest both by looks and
speech.

<p/>Mrs. Meyrick had not failed to send Deronda a report of Mirah's
well-being in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) family. <div class="bookquote">``We are getting fonder of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
had written. <div class="bookquote">``At breakfast-time we all look toward the door with
expectation to see her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) come in; and we watch her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) were a native from a new country. I have not heard a word from
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lips that gives me a doubt about her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is quite contented and
full of gratitude. My daughters are learning from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and they hope to
get her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) other pupils; for she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is anxious not to eat the bread of
idleness, but to work, like my girls. Mab says our life has become like
a fairy tale, and all she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) is afraid of is that Mirah will turn into a
nightingale again and fly away from us. Her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) voice is just perfect: not
loud and strong, but searching and melting, like the thoughts of what
has been. That is the way old people like me feel a beautiful voice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mrs. Meyrick did not enter into particulars which would have
required her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) to say that Amy and Mab, who had accompanied Mirah to the
synagogue, found the Jewish faith less reconcilable with their wishes
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) case than in that of Scott's Rebecca. They kept silence out of
delicacy to Mirah, with whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) religion was too tender a subject to
be touched lightly; but after a while Amy, who was much of a practical
reformer, could not restrain a question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, Mirah, but _does_ it seem quite right to you that the women
should sit behind rails in a gallery apart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I never thought of anything else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, with mild surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you like better to see the men with their hats on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab,
cautiously proposing the smallest item of difference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. I like what I have always seen there, because it brings back
to me the same feelings--the feelings I would not part with for
anything else in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>these people</b></font>)</div><p/>After this, any criticism, whether of doctrine or practice, would have
seemed to these generous little people an inhospitable cruelty. Mirah's
religion was of one fibre with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) affections, and had never presented
itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) as a set of propositions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says herself she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is a very bad Jewess, and does not half know her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
people's religion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy, when Mirah was gone to bed. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it
would gradually melt away from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would pass into
Christianity like the rest of the world, if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) got to love us very
much, and never found her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother. It is so strange to be of the Jews'
religion now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh, oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>cried Mab. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I were not such a hideous Christian.
How can an ugly Christian, who is always dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) work, convert a
beautiful Jewess, who has not a fault?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be wicked of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said shrewd Kate, <div class="bookquote">``but I cannot help wishing
that her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother may not be found. There might be something unpleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick. <div class="bookquote">``I believe Mirah is cut
out after the pattern of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother. And what a joy it would be to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
to have such a daughter brought back again! But a mother's feelings are
not worth reckoning, I suppose''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) shot a mischievous glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
own daughters-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``and a dead mother is worth more that a living one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may be, little mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate; <div class="bookquote">``but we would
rather hold you cheaper, and have you alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Not only the Meyricks, whose various knowledge had been acquired by the
irregular foraging to which clever girls have usually been reduced, but
Deronda himself, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) masculine instruction, had been roused by
this apparition of Mirah to the consciousness of knowing hardly
anything about modern Judaism or the inner Jewish history. The Chosen
People have been commonly treated as a people chosen for the sake of
somebody else; and their thinking as something -LRB-no matter exactly what-RRB-
that ought to have been entirely otherwise; and Deronda, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
neighbors, had regarded Judaism as a sort of eccentric fossilized form
which an accomplished man might dispense with studying, and leave to
specialists. But Mirah, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) terrified flight from one parent, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) yearning after the other, had flashed on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the hitherto neglected
reality that Judaism was something still throbbing in human lives,
still making for them the only conceivable vesture of the world; and in
the idling excursion on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediately afterward set out with Sir
Hugo he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to look for the outsides of synagogues, and the title of
books about the Jews. This awakening of a new interest--this passing
from the supposition that we hold the right opinions on a subject we
are careless about, to a sudden care for it, and a sense that our
opinions were ignorance--is an effectual remedy for _ennui_, which,
unhappily, cannot be secured on a physician's prescription; but Deronda
had carried it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and endured his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) weeks of lounging all the
better. It was on this journey that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) first entered a Jewish
synagogue--at Frankfort--where his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) party rested on a Friday. In
exploring the Juden-gasse, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had seen long before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) remembered
well enough its picturesque old houses; what his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes chiefly dwelt on
now were the human types there; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought, busily connecting them
with the past phases of their race, stirred that fibre of historic
sympathy which had helped to determine in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) certain traits worth
mentioning for those who are interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) future. True, when a
young man has a fine person, no eccentricity of manners, the education
of a gentleman, and a present income, it is not customary to feel a
prying curiosity about his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way of thinking, or his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) peculiar tastes. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
may very well be settled in life as an agreeable clever young fellow
without passing a special examination on those heads. Later, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is
getting rather slovenly and portly, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) peculiarities are more
distinctly discerned, and it is taken as a mercy if they are not highly
objectionable. But any one wishing to understand the effect of
after-events on Deronda should know a little more of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was at
five-and-twenty than was evident in ordinary intercourse.

<p/>It happened that the very vividness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) impressions had often made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) the more enigmatic to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) friends, and had contributed to an
apparent indefiniteness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sentiments. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) early-wakened
sensibility and reflectiveness had developed into a many-sided
sympathy, which threatened to hinder any persistent course of action:
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) took up any antagonism, though only in thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) seemed
to himself like the Sabine warriors in the memorable story--with
nothing to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) spear but flesh of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) flesh, and objects that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
loved. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagination had so wrought itself to the habit of seeing
things as they probably appeared to others, that a strong partisanship,
unless it were against an immediate oppression, had become an
insincerity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) plenteous, flexible sympathy had ended by
falling into one current with that reflective analysis which tends to
neutralize sympathy. Few men were able to keep themselves clearer of
vices than he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>); yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hated vices mildly, being used to think of them
less in the abstract than as a part of mixed human natures having an
individual history, which it was the bent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind to trace with
understanding and pity. With the same innate balance he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was fervidly
democratic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) feeling for the multitude, and yet, through his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
affections and imagination, intensely conservative; voracious of
speculations on government and religion, yet loth to part with
long-sanctioned forms which, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), were quick with memories and
sentiments that no argument could lay dead. We fall on the leaning
side; and Deronda suspected himself of loving too well the losing
causes of the world. Martyrdom changes sides, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was in danger of
changing with it, having a strong repugnance to taking up that clue of
success which the order of the world often forces upon us and makes it
treason against the common weal to reject. And yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) fear of falling
into an unreasoning narrow hatred made a check for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) apologized
for the heirs of privilege; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shrank with dislike from the loser's
bitterness and the denunciatory tone of the unaccepted innovator. A too
reflective and diffusive sympathy was in danger of paralyzing in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
that indignation against wrong and that selectness of fellowship which
are the conditions of moral force; and in the last few years of
confirmed manhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had become so keenly aware of this that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
most longed for was either some external event, or some inward light,
that would urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) into a definite line of action, and compress his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
wandering energy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was ceasing to care for knowledge--he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had no
ambition for practice--unless they could both be gathered up into one
current with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) emotions; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) dreaded, as if it were a
dwelling-place of lost souls, that dead anatomy of culture which turns
the universe into a mere ceaseless answer to queries, and knows, not
everything, but everything else about everything--as if one should be
ignorant of nothing concerning the scent of violets except the scent
itself for which one had no nostril. But how and whence was the needed
event to come?--the influence that would justify partiality, and make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) longed to be, yet was unable to make himself--an organic
part of social life, instead of roaming in it like a yearning
disembodied spirit, stirred with a vague social passion, but without
fixed local habitation to render fellowship real? To make a little
difference for the better was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not contented to live
without; but how to make it? It is one thing to see your road, another
to cut it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) found some of the fault in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) birth and the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had
been brought up, which had laid no special demands on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and had given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) no fixed relationship except one of a doubtful kind; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) did not
attempt to hide from himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had fallen into a meditative
numbness, and was gliding farther and farther from that life of
practically energetic sentiment which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would have proclaimed -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
had been inclined to proclaim anything-RRB- to be the best of all life, and
for himself the only way worth living. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wanted some way of keeping
emotion and its progeny of sentiments--which make the savors of
life--substantial and strong in the face of a reflectiveness that
threatened to nullify all differences. To pound the objects of
sentiment into small dust, yet keep sentiment alive and active, was
something like the famous recipe for making cannon--to first take a
round hole and then enclose it with iron; whatever you do keeping fast
hold of your round hole. Yet how distinguish what our will may wisely
save in its completeness, from the heaping of cat-mummies and the
expensive cult of enshrined putrefactions?

<p/>Something like this was the common under-current in Deronda's mind
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was reading law or imperfectly attending to polite
conversation. Meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not set about one function in particular
with zeal and steadiness. Not an admirable experience, to be proposed
as an ideal; but a form of struggle before break of day which some
young men since the patriarch have had to pass through, with more or
less of bruising if not laming.

<p/>I have said that under his (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) calm exterior he (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) had a fervor which made him (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>)
easily feel the presence of poetry in everyday events; and the forms of
the Juden-gasse, rousing the sense of union with what is remote, set
him (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) musing on two elements of our historic life which that sense raises
into the same region of poetry;--the faint beginnings of faiths and
institutions, and their obscure lingering decay; the dust and withered
remnants with which they are apt to be covered, only enhancing for the
awakened perception the impressiveness either of a sublimely
penetrating life, as in the twin green leaves that will become the
sheltering tree, or of a pathetic inheritance in which all the grandeur
and the glory have become a sorrowing memory.

<p/>This imaginative stirring, as he (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) turned out of the Juden-gasse, and
continued to saunter in the warm evening air, meaning to find his (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) way
to the synagogue, neutralized the repellent effect of certain ugly
little incidents on his (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) way. Turning into an old book-shop to ask the
exact time of service at the synagogue, he (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) was affectionately directed
by a precocious Jewish youth, who entered cordially into his (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) wanting,
not the fine new building of the Reformed but the old Rabbinical school
of the orthodox; and then cheated him (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) like a pure Teuton, only with
more amenity, in his (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) charge for a book quite out of request as one
<div class="bookquote">``nicht so leicht zu bekommen.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Meanwhile at the opposite counter a deaf
and grisly tradesman was casting a flinty look at certain cards,
apparently combining advantages of business with religion, and
shoutingly proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) in Jew-dialect by a dingy man in a tall coat
hanging from neck to heel, a bag in hand, and a broad low hat
surmounting his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) chosen nose--who had no sooner disappeared than another
dingy man of the same pattern issued from the background glooms of the
shop and also shouted in the same dialect. In fact, Deronda saw various
queer-looking Israelites not altogether without guile, and just
distinguishable from queer-looking Christians of the same mixed
_morale_. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) anxiety about Mirah's relatives, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had lately been
thinking of vulgar Jews with a sort of personal alarm. But a little
comparison will often diminish our surprise and disgust at the
aberrations of Jews and other dissidents whose lives do not offer a
consistent or lovely pattern of their creed; and this evening Deronda,
becoming more conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was falling into unfairness and
ridiculous exaggeration, began to use that corrective comparison: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thaler too much, without prejudice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) interests in the
Hebrew destiny, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wish to find the _Rabbinische Schule_, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
arrived at by sunset, and entered with a good congregation of men.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) happened to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) seat in a line with an elderly man from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
was distant enough to glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) more than once as rather a
noticeable figure--his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ample white beard and felt hat framing a profile
of that fine contour which may as easily be Italian as Hebrew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
returned Deronda's notice till at last their eyes met; an undesirable
chance with unknown persons, and a reason to Deronda for not looking
again; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) immediately found an open prayer-book pushed toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
and had to bow his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thanks. However, the congregation had mustered, the
reader had mounted to the _almemor_ or platform, and the service began.
Deronda, having looked enough at the German translation of the Hebrew
in the book before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was chiefly hearing Psalms and
Old Testament passages or phrases, gave himself up to that strongest
effect of chanted liturgies which is independent of detailed verbal
meaning--like the effect of an Allegri's _Miserere_ or a Palestrina's
_Magnificat_. The most powerful movement of feeling with a liturgy is
the prayer which seeks for nothing special, but is a yearning to escape
from the limitations of our own weakness and an invocation of all Good
to enter and abide with us; or else a self-oblivious lifting up of
Gladness, a _Gloria in excelsis_ that such Good exists; both the
yearning and the exaltation gathering their utmost force from the sense
of communion in a form which has expressed them both, for long
generations of struggling fellow-men. The Hebrew liturgy, like others,
has its transitions of litany, lyric, proclamation, dry statement and
blessing; but this evening, all were one for Deronda: the chant of the
_Chazaris_ or Reader's grand wide-ranging voice with its passage from
monotony to sudden cries, the outburst of sweet boys' voices from the
little choir, the devotional swaying of men's bodies backward and
forward, the very commonness of the building and shabbiness of the
scene where a national faith, which had penetrated the thinking of half
the world, and moulded the splendid forms of that world's religion, was
finding a remote, obscure echo--all were blent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as one
expression of a binding history, tragic and yet glorious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wondered
at the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own feeling; it seemed beyond the occasion--what
one might imagine to be a divine influx in the darkness, before there
was any vision to interpret. The whole scene was a coherent strain, its
burden a passionate regret, which, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had known the liturgy for the
Day of Reconciliation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might have clad in its authentic burden;
<div class="bookquote">``Happy the eye which saw all these things; but verily to hear only of
them afflicts our soul. Happy the eye that saw our temple and the joy
of our congregation; but verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul.
Happy the eye that saw the fingers when tuning every kind of song; but
verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But with the cessation of the devotional sounds and the movement of
many indifferent faces and vulgar figures before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) there darted into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind the frigid idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had probably been alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
feeling, and perhaps the only person in the congregation for whom the
service was more than a dull routine. There was just time for this
chilling thought before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had bowed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) civil neighbor and was
moving away with the rest--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) arm, and turning
with the rather unpleasant sensation which this abrupt sort of claim is
apt to bring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) the white-bearded face of that
neighbor, who said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in German, <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, young gentleman--allow
me--what is your parentage--your mother's family--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) maiden name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>German</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda had a strongly resistant feeling: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was inclined to shake off
hastily the touch on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) arm; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) managed to slip it away and said
coldly, <div class="bookquote">``I am an Englishman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The questioner looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) dubiously still for an instant, then just
lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) hat and turned away; whether under a sense of having made a
mistake or of having been repulsed, Deronda was uncertain. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) walk
back to the hotel he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tried to still any uneasiness on the subject by
reflecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not have acted differently. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) say
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) did not know the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother's family to that total
stranger?--who indeed had taken an unwarrantable liberty in the
abruptness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) question, dictated probably by some fancy of likeness
such as often occurs without real significance. The incident, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said
to himself, was trivial; but whatever import it might have, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) inward
shrinking on the occasion was too strong for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to be sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
had cut it short. It was a reason, however, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) not mentioning the
synagogue to the Mallingers--in addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) usual inclination to
reticence on anything that the baronet would have been likely to call
Quixotic enthusiasm. Hardly any man could be more good-natured than Sir
Hugo; indeed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) kindliness especially to women, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) did actions
which others would have called romantic; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) never took a romantic
view of them, and in general smiled at the introduction of motives on a
grand scale, or of reasons that lay very far off. This was the point of
strongest difference between him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) and Deronda, who rarely ate at
breakfast without some silent discursive flight after grounds for
filling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) day according to the practice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) contemporaries.

<p/>This halt at Frankfort was taken on their way home, and its impressions
were kept the more actively vibrating in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) by the duty of caring for
Mirah's welfare. That question about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) parentage, which if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not
both inwardly and outwardly shaken it off as trivial, would have seemed
a threat rather than a promise of revelation, and reinforced his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
anxiety as to the effect of finding Mirah's relatives and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) resolve
to proceed with caution. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) made any unpleasant discovery, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
bound to a disclosure that might cast a new net of trouble around her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>)?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had written to Mrs. Meyrick to announce his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) visit at four o'clock,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) found Mirah seated at work with only Mrs. Meyrick and Mab, the
open piano, and all the glorious company of engravings. The dainty
neatness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hair and dress, the glow of tranquil happiness in a
face where a painter need have changed nothing if he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) had wanted to put
it in front of the host singing <div class="bookquote">``peace on earth and good will to men,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>made a contrast to his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) first vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) that was delightful to
Deronda's eyes. Mirah herself was thinking of it, and immediately on
their greeting said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See how different I am from the miserable creature by the river! all
because you found me and brought me to the very best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my good chance to find you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``Any other man would
have been glad to do what I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not the right way to be thinking about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah,
shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) head with decisive gravity, <div class="bookquote">``I think of what really was. It
was you, and not another, who found me and were good to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I agree with Mirah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick. <div class="bookquote">``Saint Anybody is a bad saint
to pray to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, Anybody could not have brought me to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah,
smiling at Mrs. Meyrick. <div class="bookquote">``And I would rather be with you than with any
one else in the world except my mother. I wonder if ever a poor little
bird, that was lost and could not fly, was taken and put into a warm
nest where was a mother and sisters who took to it so that everything
came naturally, as if it had been always there. I hardly thought before
that the world could ever be as happy and without fear as it is to me
now.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) looked meditative a moment, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``sometimes I am a
_little_ afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it you are afraid of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda with anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That when I am turning at the corner of a street I may meet my father.
It seems dreadful that I should be afraid of meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). That is my
only sorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, plaintively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is surely not very probable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, wishing that it were
less so; then, not to let the opportunity escape--<div class="bookquote">``Would it be a great
grief to you now if you were never to meet your mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) did not answer immediately, but meditated again, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) eyes
fixed on the opposite wall. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) turned them on Deronda and said
firmly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had arrived at the exact truth, <div class="bookquote">``I want her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to know
that I have always loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is alive I want to comfort
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may be dead. If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were I should long to know where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
buried; and to know whether my brother lives, so that we can remember
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) together. But I will try not to grieve. I have thought much for so
many years of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being dead. And I shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with me in my mind,
as I have always had. We can never be really parted. I think I have
never sinned against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I have always tried not to do what would hurt
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Only, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might be sorry that I was not a good Jewess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way are you not a good Jewess?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ignorant, and we never observed the laws, but lived among
Christians just as they did. But I have heard my father laugh at the
strictness of the Jews about their food and all customs, and their not
liking Christians. I think my mother was strict; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could never
want me not to like those who are better to me than any of my own
people I have ever known. I think I could obey in other things that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
wished but not in that. It is so much easier to me to share in love
than in hatred. I remember a play I read in German--since I have been
here it has come into my mind--where the heroine says something like
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Antigone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you know it. But I do not believe that my mother would wish me not
to love my best friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be grateful to them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>Here Mirah had
turned to Mrs. Meyrick, and with a sudden lighting up of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) whole
countenance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if we ever do meet and know each other as
we are now, so that I could tell what would comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--I should be so
full of blessedness my soul would know no want but to love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, the words escaping
involuntarily from her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) motherly heart. But to relieve the strain of
feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) looked at Deronda and said, <div class="bookquote">``It is curious that Mirah, who
remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother so well it is as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), cannot recall her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
brother the least bit--except the feeling of having been carried by him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was tired, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) being near her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
mother's lap. It must be that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was rarely at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was already
grown up. It is a pity her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother should be quite a stranger to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is good; I feel sure Ezra is good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, eagerly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) loved
my mother--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) would take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I remember more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) than that.
I remember my mother's voice once calling, ``Ezra!<div class="bookquote">'' and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
answering from a distance `Mother!''' (<font color='red'><b>Ezra</b></font>)</div>--Mirah had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) voice a
little in each of these words and had given them a loving
intonation--<div class="bookquote">``and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) came close to us. I feel sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) is good. I
have always taken comfort from that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>It was impossible to answer this either with agreement or doubt. Mrs.
Meyrick and Deronda exchanged a quick glance: about this brother she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
felt as painfully dubious as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did. But Mirah went on, absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
memories--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not wonderful how I remember the voices better than anything
else? I think they must go deeper into us than other things. I have
often fancied heaven might be made of voices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like your singing--yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, who had hitherto kept a modest
silence, and now spoke bashfully, as was her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) wont in the presence of
Prince Camaralzaman--<div class="bookquote">``Ma, do ask Mirah to sing. Mr. Deronda has not
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Camaralzaman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it be disagreeable to you to sing now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with a
more deferential gentleness than he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had ever been conscious of before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I shall like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah. <div class="bookquote">``My voice has come back a little
with rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) ease of manner was due to something more than the
simplicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) nature. The circumstances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) life made her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) think
of everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) did as work demanded from her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), in which affectation
had nothing to do; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had begun her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) work before self-consciousness
was born.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) immediately rose and went to the piano--a somewhat worn instrument
that seemed to get the better of its infirmities under the firm touch
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) small fingers as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) preluded. Deronda placed himself where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) sang; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) took everything as quietly as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had been a child going to breakfast.

<p/>Imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)--it is always good to imagine a human creature in whom
bodily loveliness seems as properly one with the entire being as the
bodily loveliness of those wondrous transparent orbs of life that we
find in the sea--imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) dark hair brushed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
temples, but yet showing certain tiny rings there which had cunningly
found their own way back, the mass of it hanging behind just to the
nape of the little neck in curly fibres, such as renew themselves at
their own will after being bathed into straightness like that of
water-grasses. Then see the perfect cameo her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) profile makes, cut in a
duskish shell, where by some happy fortune there pierced a gem-like
darkness for the eye and eyebrow; the delicate nostrils defined enough
to be ready for sensitive movements, the finished ear, the firm curves
of the chin and neck, entering into the expression of a refinement
which was not feebleness.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) sang Beethoven's <div class="bookquote">``Per pietà non dirmi addio''  (<font color='red'><b>Beethoven</b></font>)</div>with a subdued but
searching pathos which had that essential of perfect singing, the
making one oblivious of art or manner, and only possessing one with the
song. It was the sort of voice that gives the impression of being meant
like a bird's wooing for an audience near and beloved. Deronda began by
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), but felt himself presently covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
hand, wanting to seclude the melody in darkness; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) refrained from
what might seem oddity, and was ready to meet the look of mute appeal
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) turned toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) at the end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I never enjoyed a song more than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, gratefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You like my singing? I am so glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) said, with a smile of delight.
<div class="bookquote">``It has been a great pain to me, because it failed in what it was
wanted for. But now we think I can use it to get my bread. I have
really been taught well. And now I have two pupils, that Miss Meyrick
found for me. They pay me nearly two crowns for their two lessons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I know some ladies who would find you many pupils after
Christmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``You would not mind singing before any one
who wished to hear you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I want to do something to get money. I could teach reading and
speaking, Mrs. Meyrick thinks. But if no one would learn of me, that is
difficult.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>Mirah smiled with a touch of merriment he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not seen in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) before. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say I should find her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) poor--I mean my mother. I
should want to get money for her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>). And I can not always live on charity;
though'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--here she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) turned so as to take all three of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) companions in
one glance--<div class="bookquote">``it is the sweetest charity in all the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think you can get rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Great ladies
will perhaps like you to teach their daughters, We shall see. But now
do sing again to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) went on willingly, singing with ready memory various things by
Gordigiani and Schubert; then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had left the piano, Mab said,
entreatingly, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mirah, if you would not mind singing the little
hymn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too childish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah. <div class="bookquote">``It is like lisping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the hymn?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the Hebrew hymn she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother singing over her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) when
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lay in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like very much to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``if you think I am
worthy to hear what is so sacred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will sing it if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't sing real
words--only here and there a syllable like hers--the rest is lisping.
Do you know Hebrew? because if you do, my singing will seem childish
nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It will be quite good Hebrew to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) little feet and hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) easiest attitude, and
then lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) head at an angle which seemed to be directed to some
invisible face bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) sang a little hymn of quaint
melancholy intervals, with syllables that really seemed childish
lisping to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) audience; the voice in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) gave it forth had
gathered even a sweeter, more cooing tenderness than was heard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
other songs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were ever to know the real words, I should still go on in my old
way with them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had repeated the hymn several
times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``The lisped syllables are very full of
meaning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick. <div class="bookquote">``A mother hears something of a lisp
in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children's talk to the very last. Their words are not just what
everybody else says, though they may be spelled the same. If I were to
live till my Hans got old, I should still see the boy in him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>). A
mother's love, I often say, is like a tree that has got all the wood in
it, from the very first it made.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is not that the way with friendship, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``We
must not let the mothers be too arrogant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The little woman shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) darning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is easier to find an old mother than an old friend. Friendships
begin with liking or gratitude--roots that can be pulled up. Mother's
love begins deeper down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like what you were saying about the influence of voices,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, looking at Mirah. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think your hymn would have had more
expression for me if I had known the words. I went to the synagogue at
Frankfort before I came home, and the service impressed me just as much
as if I had followed the words--perhaps more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, was it great to you? Did it go to your heart?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah,
eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``I thought none but our people would feel that. I thought it
was all shut away like a river in a deep valley, where only heaven
saw--I mean--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hesitated feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not disentangle
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought from its imagery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``But there is not really such a
separation--deeper down, as Mrs. Meyrick says. Our religion is chiefly
a Hebrew religion; and since Jews are men, their religious feelings
must have much in common with those of other men--just as their poetry,
though in one sense peculiar, has a great deal in common with the
poetry of other nations. Still it is to be expected that a Jew would
feel the forms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) people's religion more than one of another
race--and yet'' (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>--here Deronda hesitated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) turn--<div class="bookquote">``that is perhaps
not always so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, sadly. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen that. I have seen them mock.
Is it not like mocking your parents?--like rejoicing in your parents'
shame?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some minds naturally rebel against whatever they were brought up in,
and like the opposite; they see the faults in what is nearest to them,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda apologetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with
unconscious fixedness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda; <div class="bookquote">``but you know I was not brought up as
a Jew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I am always forgetting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, with a look of disappointed
recollection, and slightly blushing.

<p/>Deronda also felt rather embarrassed, and there was an awkward pause,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) put an end to by saying playfully--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whichever way we take it, we have to tolerate each other; for if we
all went in opposition to our teaching, we must end in difference, just
the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure. We should go on forever in zig-zags,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick.
<div class="bookquote">``I think it is very weak-minded to make your creed up by the rule of
the contrary. Still one may honor one's parents, without following
their notions exactly, any more than the exact cut of their clothing.
My father was a Scotch Calvinist and my mother was a French Calvinist;
I am neither quite Scotch, nor quite French, nor two Calvinists rolled
into one, yet I honor my parents' memory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I could not make myself not a Jewess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, insistently,
<div class="bookquote">``even if I changed my belief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear. But if Jews and Jewesses went on changing their religion,
and making no difference between themselves and Christians, there would
come a time when there would be no Jews to be seen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick,
taking that consummation very cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please not to say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, the tears gathering. ``It is
the first unkind thing you ever said. I will not begin that. I will
never separate myself from my mother's people. I was forced to fly from
my father; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came back in age and weakness and want, and needed
me, should I say, <div class="bookquote">``This is not my father'? If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had shame, I must
share it. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) who was given to me for my father, and not another.
And so it is with my people. I will always be a Jewess. I will love
Christians when they are good, like you. But I will always cling to my
people. I will always worship with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mirah had gone on speaking she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had become possessed with a sorrowful
passion--fervent, not violent. Holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) little hands tightly clasped
and looking at Mrs. Meyrick with beseeching, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) seemed to Deronda a
personification of that spirit which impelled men after a long
inheritance of professed Catholicism to leave wealth and high place and
risk their lives in flight, that they might join their own people and
say, <div class="bookquote">``I am a Jew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mirah, Mirah, my dear child, you mistake me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick,
alarmed. <div class="bookquote">``God forbid I should want you to do anything against your
conscience. I was only saying what might be if the world went on. But I
had better have left the world alone, and not wanted to be over-wise.
Forgive me, come! we will not try to take you from anybody you feel has
more right to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would do anything else for you. I owe you my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, not
yet quite calm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick. <div class="bookquote">``I have been punished enough for
wagging my tongue foolishly--making an almanac for the Millennium, as
my husband used to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But everything in the world must come to an end some time. We must
bear to think of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, unable to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) peace on this
point. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had already suffered from a bondage of tongue which
threatened to become severe if Mirah were to be too much indulged in
this inconvenient susceptibility to innocent remarks.

<p/>Deronda smiled at the irregular, blonde face, brought into strange
contrast by the side of Mirah's--smiled, Mab thought, rather
sarcastically as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``That `prospect of everything coming to an
end will not guide us far in practice. Mirah's feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tells us,
are concerned with what is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mab was confused and wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had not spoken, since Mr. Deronda
seemed to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had found fault with Mirah; but to have spoken
once is a tyrannous reason for speaking again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only meant that we must have courage to hear things, else there is
hardly anything we can talk about.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mab felt herself unanswerable here,
inclining to the opinion of Socrates: <div class="bookquote">``What motive has a man to live,
if not for the pleasure of discourse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Socrates</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda took his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) leave soon after, and when Mrs. Meyrick went outside
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to exchange a few words about Mirah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Hans is to
share my chambers when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) comes at Christmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have written to Rome about that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) face
lighting up. <div class="bookquote">``How very good and thoughtful of you! You mentioned Mirah,
then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I referred to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). I concluded he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) knew everything from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must confess my folly. I have not yet written a word about her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). I
have always been meaning to do it, and yet have ended my letter without
saying a word. And I told the girls to leave it to me. However!--Thank
you a thousand times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda divined something of what was in the mother's mind, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
divination reinforced a certain anxiety already present in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
inward colloquy was not soothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said to himself that no man could
see this exquisite creature without feeling it possible to fall in love
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>); but all the fervor of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature was engaged on the side of
precaution. There are personages who feel themselves tragic because
they march into a palpable morass, dragging another with them, and then
cry out against all the gods. Deronda's mind was strongly set against
imitating them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have my hands on the reins now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and I will not drop
them. I shall go there as little as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw the reasons acting themselves out before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) be
Mirah's guardian and claim to unite with Mrs. Meyrick, to whose charge
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had committed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) showed himself as a lover--whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) did not
love--whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) would not marry? And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) encouraged any germ of
lover's feeling in himself it would lead up to that issue. Mirah's was
not a nature that would bear dividing against itself; and even if love
won her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) consent to marry a man who was not of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) race and religion,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) would never be happy in acting against that strong native bias
which would still reign in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) conscience as remorse.

<p/>Deronda saw these consequences as we see any danger of marring our own
work well begun. It was a delight to have rescued this child acquainted
with sorrow, and to think of having placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) little feet in protected
paths. The creature we help to save, though only a half-reared linnet,
bruised and lost by the wayside--how we watch and fence it, and dote on
its signs of recovery! Our pride becomes loving, our self is a not-self
for whose sake we become virtuous, when we set to some hidden work of
reclaiming a life from misery and look for our triumph in the secret
joy--<div class="bookquote">``This one is the better for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would as soon hold out my finger to be bitten off as set about
spoiling her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) peace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``It was one of the rarest bits of
fortune that I should have had friends like the Meyricks to place her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
with--generous, delicate friends without any loftiness in their ways,
so that her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) dependence on them is not only safety but happiness. There
could be no refuge to replace that, if it were broken up. But what is
the use of my taking the vows and settling everything as it should be,
if that marplot Hans comes and upsets it all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Few things were more likely. Hans was made for mishaps: his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) very limbs
seemed more breakable than other people's--his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) eyes more of a resort
for uninvited flies and other irritating guests. But it was impossible
to forbid Hans's coming to London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was intending to get a studio
there and make it his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) chief home; and to propose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) should defer
coming on some ostensible ground, concealing the real motive of winning
time for Mirah's position to become more confirmed and independent, was
impracticable. Having no other resource Deronda tried to believe that
both he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and Mrs. Meyrick were foolishly troubling themselves about one
of those endless things called probabilities, which never occur; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
did not quite succeed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) trying; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) found himself
going inwardly through a scene where on the first discovery of Han's
inclination he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) a very energetic warning--suddenly checked,
however, by the suspicion of personal feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) warmth might be
creating in Hans. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) could come to no result, but that the position was
peculiar, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) could make no further provision against dangers
until they came nearer. To save an unhappy Jewess from drowning
herself, would not have seemed a startling variation among police
reports; but to discover in her (<font color='blue'><b>Han</b></font>) so rare a creature as Mirah, was an
exceptional event which might well bring exceptional consequences.
Deronda would not let himself for a moment dwell on any supposition
that the consequences might enter deeply into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own life. The image
of Mirah had never yet had that penetrating radiation which would have
been given to it by the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Han</b></font>) loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). When this sort of
effluence is absent from the fancy -LRB-whether from the fact or not-RRB- a man
may go far in devotedness without perturbation.

<p/>As to the search for Mirah's mother and brother, Deronda took what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had said to-day as a warrant for deferring any immediate measures. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
conscience was not quite easy in this desire for delay, any more than
it was quite easy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) not attempting to learn the truth about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
own mother: in both cases he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt that there might be an unfulfilled
duty to a parent, but in both cases there was an overpowering
repugnance to the possible truth, which threw a turning weight into the
scale of argument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At least, I will look about,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) final determination. <div class="bookquote">``I may find
some special Jewish machinery. I will wait till after Christmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>What should we all do without the calendar, when we want to put off a
disagreeable duty? The admirable arrangements of the solar system, by
which our time is measured, always supply us with a term before which
it is hardly worth while to set about anything we are disinclined to.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No man,''  (<font color='red'><b>a Rabbi</b></font>)</div>says a Rabbi, by way of indisputable instance, <div class="bookquote">``may turn the
bones of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father and mother into spoons'' (<font color='red'><b>a Rabbi</b></font>)</div>--sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>) hearers
felt the checks against that form of economy. The market for spoons
has never expanded enough for any one to say, <div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and to argue
that human progress lies in such an application of material. The only
check to be alleged is a sentiment, which will coerce none who do not
hold that sentiments are the better part of the world's wealth.


<p/>Deronda meanwhile took to a less fashionable form of exercise than
riding in Rotten Row. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went often rambling in those parts of London
which are most inhabited by common Jews. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) walked to the synagogues at
times of service, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked into shops, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) observed faces:--a process
not very promising of particular discovery. Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) not address
himself to an influential Rabbi or other member of a Jewish community,
to consult on the chances of finding a mother named Cohen, with a son
named Ezra, and a lost daughter named Mirah? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) thought of doing
so--after Christmas. The fact was, notwithstanding all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) sense of
poetry in common things, Deronda, where a keen personal interest was
aroused, could not, more than the rest of us, continuously escape
suffering from the pressure of that hard unaccommodating Actual, which
has never consulted our taste and is entirely unselect. Enthusiasm, we
know, dwells at ease among ideas, tolerates garlic breathed in the
middle ages, and sees no shabbiness in the official trappings of
classic processions: it gets squeamish when ideals press upon it as
something warmly incarnate, and can hardly face them without fainting.
Lying dreamily in a boat, imagining one's self in quest of a beautiful
maiden's relatives in Cordova elbowed by Jews in the time of
Ibn-Gebirol, all the physical incidents can be borne without shock. Or
if the scenery of St. Mary Axe and Whitechapel were imaginatively
transported to the borders of the Rhine at the end of the eleventh
century, when in the ears listening for the signals of the Messiah, the
Hep! Hep! Hep! of the Crusaders came like the bay of blood-hounds; and
in the presence of those devilish missionaries with sword and firebrand
the crouching figure of the reviled Jew turned round erect, heroic,
flashing with sublime constancy in the face of torture and death--what
would the dingy shops and unbeautiful faces signify to the thrill of
contemplative emotion? But the fervor of sympathy with which we
contemplate a grandiose martyrdom is feeble compared with the
enthusiasm that keeps unslacked where there is no danger, no
challenge--nothing but impartial midday falling on commonplace, perhaps
half-repulsive, objects which are really the beloved ideas made flesh.
Here undoubtedly lies the chief poetic energy:--in the force of
imagination that pierces or exalts the solid fact, instead of floating
among cloud-pictures. To glory in a prophetic vision of knowledge
covering the earth, is an easier exercise of believing imagination than
to see its beginning in newspaper placards, staring at you from the
bridge beyond the corn-fields; and it might well happen to most of us
dainty people that we were in the thick of the battle of Armageddon
without being aware of anything more than the annoyance of a little
explosive smoke and struggling on the ground immediately about us.

<p/>It lay in Deronda's nature usually to contemn the feeble, fastidious
sympathy which shrinks from the broad life of mankind; but now, with
Mirah before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as a living reality, whose experience he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had to care
for, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw every common Jew and Jewess in the light of a comparison
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), and had a presentiment of the collision between her (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) idea of
the unknown mother and brother and the discovered fact--a presentiment
all the keener in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) because of a suppressed consciousness that a not
unlike possibility of collision might lie hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own lot. Not
that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would have looked with more complacency of expectation at
wealthy Jews, outdoing the lords of the Philistines in their sports;
but since there was no likelihood of Mirah's friends being found among
that class, their habits did not immediately affect him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). In this mood
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) rambled, without expectation of a more pregnant result than a little
preparation of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own mind, perhaps for future theorizing as well as
practice--very much as if, Mirah being related to Welsh miners, he (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) had
gone to look more closely at the ways of those people, not without
wishing at the same time to get a little light of detail on the history
of Strikes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) really did not long to find anybody in particular; and when, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>)
habit was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) looked at the name over a shop door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) was well content
that it was not Ezra Cohen. I confess, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) particularly desired that
Ezra Cohen should not keep a shop. Wishes are held to be ominous;
according to which belief the order of the world is so arranged that if
you have an impious objection to a squint, your offspring is the more
likely to be born with one; also, that if you happened to desire a
squint you would not get it. This desponding view of probability the
hopeful entirely reject, taking their wishes as good and sufficient
security for all kinds of fulfilment. Who is absolutely neutral?
Deronda happening one morning to turn into a little side street out of
the noise and obstructions of Holborn, felt the scale dip on the
desponding side.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was rather tired of the streets and had paused to hail a hansom cab
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw coming, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) attention was caught by some fine old
clasps in chased silver displayed in the window at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) right hand. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
first thought was that Lady Mallinger, who had a strictly Protestant
taste for such Catholic spoils, might like to have these missal-clasps
turned into a bracelet: then his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes traveled over the other contents
of the window, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw that the shop was that kind of pawnbroker's
where the lead is given to jewelry, lace and all equivocal objects
introduced as _bric-à-brac_. A placard in one corner
announced--_Watches and Jewelry exchanged and repaired_. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) survey
had been noticed from within, and a figure appeared at the door,
looking round at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and saying in a tone of cordial encouragement,
<div class="bookquote">``Good day, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The instant was enough for Deronda to see the face,
unmistakably Jewish, belonged to a young man about thirty, and wincing
from the shopkeeper's persuasiveness that would probably follow, he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) had
no sooner returned the <div class="bookquote">``good day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>than he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) passed to the other side of
the street and beckoned to the cabman to draw up there. From that
station he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) saw the name over the shop window--Ezra Cohen.

<p/>There might be a hundred Ezra Cohens lettered above shop windows, but
Deronda had not seen them. Probably the young man interested in a
possible customer was Ezra himself; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) was about the age to be
expected in Mirah's brother, who was grown up while she (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) was still a
little child. But Deronda's first endeavor as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) drove homeward was to
convince himself that there was not the slightest warrantable
presumption of this Ezra being Mirah's brother; and next, that even if,
in spite of good reasoning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) turned out to be that brother, while on
inquiry the mother was found to be dead, it was not
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)--Deronda's--duty to make known the discovery to Mirah. In
inconvenient disturbance of this conclusion there came his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
lately-acquired knowledge that Mirah would have a religious desire to
know of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's death, and also to learn whether her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother were
living. How far was he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) justified in determining another life by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own
notions? Was it not his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) secret complaint against the way in which
others had ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own life, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had not open daylight on all
its relations, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had not, like other men, the full guidance of
primary duties?

<p/>The immediate relief from this inward debate was the reflection that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
had not yet made any real discovery, and that by looking into the facts
more closely he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should be certified that there was no demand on him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) for
any decision whatever. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) intended to return to that shop as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
could conveniently, and buy the clasps for Lady Mallinger. But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
hindered for several days by Sir Hugo, who, about to make an
after-dinner speech on a burning topic, wanted Deronda to forage for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) on the legal part of the question, besides wasting time every day
on argument which always ended in a drawn battle. As on many other
questions, they held different sides, but Sir Hugo did not mind this,
and when Deronda put his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) point well, said, with a mixture of
satisfaction and regret--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound it, Dan! why don't you make an opportunity of saying these
things in public? You're wrong, you know. You won't succeed. You've got
the massive sentiment--the heavy artillery of the country against you.
But it's all the better ground for a young man to display himself on.
When I was your age, I should have taken it. And it would be quite as
well for you to be in opposition to me here and there. It would throw
you more into relief. If you would seize an occasion of this sort to
make an impression, you might be in Parliament in no time. And you know
that would gratify me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry not to do what would gratify you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``But
I cannot persuade myself to look at politics as a profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? if a man is not born into public life by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position in the
country, there's no way for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but to embrace it by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own efforts.
The business of the country must be done--her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Majesty's Government
carried on, as the old Duke said. And it never could be, my boy, if
everybody looked at politics as if they were prophecy, and demanded an
inspired vocation. If you are to get into Parliament, it won't do to
sit still and wait for a call either from heaven or constituents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to make a living out of opinions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda;
<div class="bookquote">``especially out of borrowed opinions. Not that I mean to blame other
men. I dare say many better fellows than I don't mind getting on to a
platform to praise themselves, and giving their word of honor for a
party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what, Dan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, <div class="bookquote">``a man who sets his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) face
against every sort of humbug is simply a three-cornered, impracticable
fellow. There's a bad style of humbug, but there is also a good
style--one that oils the wheels and makes progress possible. If you are
to rule men, you must rule them through their own ideas; and I agree
with the Archbishop at Naples who had a St. Januarius procession
against the plague. It's no use having an Order in Council against
popular shallowness. There is no action possible without a little
acting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One may be obliged to give way to an occasional necessity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda. ``But it is one thing to say, ``In this particular case I am
forced to put on this foolscap and grin,<div class="bookquote">'' and another to buy a pocket
foolscap and practice myself in grinning. I can't see any real public
expediency that does not keep an ideal before it which makes a limit of
deviation from the direct path. But if I were to set up for a public
man I might mistake my success for public expediency.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was after this dialogue, which was rather jarring to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that
Deronda set out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) meditated second visit to Ezra Cohen's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
entered the street at the end opposite to the Holborn entrance, and an
inward reluctance slackened his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) pace while his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thoughts were
transferring what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had just been saying about public expediency to
the entirely private difficulty which brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) back again into this
unattractive thoroughfare. It might soon become an immediate practical
question with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could call it a wise expediency to conceal
the fact of close kindred. Such questions turning up constantly in life
are often decided in a rough-and-ready way; and to many it will appear
an over-refinement in Deronda that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should make any great point of a
matter confined to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own knowledge. But we have seen the reasons why
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had come to regard concealment as a bane of life, and the necessity
of concealment as a mark by which lines of action were to be avoided.
The prospect of being urged against the confirmed habit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind was
naturally grating. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) even paused here and there before the most
plausible shop-windows for a gentleman to look into, half inclined to
decide that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would not increase his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knowledge about that modern Ezra,
who was certainly not a leader among his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) people--a hesitation which
proved how, in a man much given to reasoning, a bare possibility may
weigh more than the best-clad likelihood; for Deronda's reasoning had
decided that all likelihood was against this man's being Mirah's
brother.

<p/>One of the shop-windows he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) paused before was that of a second-hand
book-shop, where, on a narrow table outside, the literature of the ages
was represented in judicious mixture, from the immortal verse of Homer
to the mortal prose of the railway novel. That the mixture was
judicious was apparent from Deronda's finding in it something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
wanted--namely, that wonderful bit of autobiography, the life of the
Polish Jew, Salomon Maimon; which, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could easily slip it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) took from its place, and entered the shop to pay for,
expecting to see behind the counter a grimy personage showing that
_nonchalance_ about sales which seems to belong universally to the
second-hand book-business. In most other trades you find generous men
who are anxious to sell you their wares for your own welfare; but even
a Jew will not urge Simson's Euclid on you with an affectionate
assurance that you will have pleasure in reading it, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) wishes
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had twenty more of the article, so much is it in request. One is led
to fear that a secondhand bookseller may belong to that unhappy class
of men who have no belief in the good of what they get their living by,
yet keep conscience enough to be morose rather than unctuous in their
vocation.

<p/>But instead of the ordinary tradesman, he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) saw, on the dark background
of books in the long narrow shop, a figure that was somewhat startling
in its unusualness. A man in threadbare clothing, whose age was
difficult to guess--from the dead yellowish flatness of the flesh,
something like an old ivory carving--was seated on a stool against some
bookshelves that projected beyond the short counter, doing nothing more
remarkable than reading yesterday's _Times_; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let the paper
rest on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lap and looked at the incoming customer, the thought
glanced through Deronda that precisely such a physiognomy as that might
possibly have been seen in a prophet of the Exile, or in some New
Hebrew poet of the mediæval time. It was a fine typical Jewish face,
wrought into intensity of expression apparently by a strenuous eager
experience in which all the satisfaction had been indirect and far off,
and perhaps by some bodily suffering also, which involved that absence
of ease in the present. The features were clear-cut, not large; the
brow not high but broad, and fully defined by the crisp black hair. It
might never have been a particularly handsome face, but it must always
have been forcible; and now with its dark, far-off gaze, and yellow
pallor in relief on the gloom of the backward shop, one might have
imagined one's self coming upon it in some past prison of the
Inquisition, which a mob had suddenly burst upon; while the look fixed
on an incidental customer seemed eager and questioning enough to have
been turned on one who might have been a messenger either of delivery
or of death. The figure was probably familiar and unexciting enough to
the inhabitants of this street; but to Deronda's mind it brought so
strange a blending of the unwonted with the common, that there was a
perceptible interval of mutual observation before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
question; <div class="bookquote">``What is the price of this book?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After taking the book and examining the fly-leaves without rising, the
supposed bookseller said, <div class="bookquote">``There is no mark, and Mr. Ram is not in now.
I am keeping the shop while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ram</b></font>) is gone to dinner. What are you disposed
to give for it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the bookseller</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) held the book close on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) lap with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand on it
and looked examiningly at Deronda, over whom there came the
disagreeable idea, that possibly this striking personage wanted to see
how much could be got out of a customer's ignorance of prices. But
without further reflection he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you know how much it is
worth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not its market-price. May I ask have you read it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I have read an account of it, which makes me want to buy it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a man of learning--you are interested in Jewish history?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This
was said in a deepened tone of eager inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am certainly interested in Jewish history,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, quietly,
curiosity overcoming his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) dislike to the sort of inspection as well as
questioning he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was under.

<p/>But immediately the strange Jew rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) sitting posture, and
Deronda felt a thin hand pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) arm tightly, while a hoarse,
excited voice, not much above a loud whisper, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are perhaps of our race?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda colored deeply, not liking the grasp, and then answered with a
slight shake of the head, <div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>The grasp was relaxed, the hand
withdrawn, the eagerness of the face collapsed into uninterested
melancholy, as if some possessing spirit which had leaped into the eyes
and gestures had sunk back again to the inmost recesses of the frame;
and moving further off as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) held out the little book, the stranger
said in a tone of distant civility, <div class="bookquote">``I believe Mr. Ram will be
satisfied with half-a-crown, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>The effect of this change on Deronda--he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) afterward smiled when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
recalled it--was oddly embarrassing and humiliating, as if some high
dignitary had found him (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) deficient and given him (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) _congé_. There was
nothing further to be said, however: he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) paid his (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) half-crown and carried
off his (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) _Salomon Maimon's Lebensgeschichte_ with a mere <div class="bookquote">``good-morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Salomon Maimon/Maimon</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) felt some vexation at the sudden arrest of the interview, and the
apparent prohibition that he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) should know more of this man, who was
certainly something out of the common way--as different probably as a
Jew could well be from Ezra Cohen, through whose door Deronda was
presently entering, and whose flourishing face glistening on the way to
fatness was hanging over the counter in negotiation with some one on
the other side of the partition, concerning two plated stoppers and
three teaspoons, which lay spread before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). Seeing Deronda enter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
called out <div class="bookquote">``Mother! Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then with a familiar nod and smile,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Coming, sir--coming directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda could not help looking toward the door from the back with some
anxiety, which was not soothed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw a vigorous woman beyond
fifty enter and approach to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). Not that there was anything very
repulsive about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): the worst that could be said was that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had that
look of having made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) toilet with little water, and by twilight,
which is common to unyouthful people of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) class, and of having
presumably slept in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) large earrings, if not in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rings and
necklace. In fact, what caused a sinking of heart in Deronda was, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
not being so coarse and ugly as to exclude the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being
Mirah's mother. Any one who has looked at a face to try and discern
signs of known kinship in it will understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) process of
conjecture--how he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tried to think away the fat which had gradually
disguised the outlines of youth, and to discern what one may call the
elementary expressions of the face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was sorry to see no absolute
negative to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) fears. Just as it was conceivable that this Ezra,
brought up to trade, might resemble the scapegrace father in everything
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) knowledge and talent, so it was not impossible that this mother
might have had a lovely refined daughter whose type of feature and
expression was like Mirah's. The eyebrows had a vexatious similarity of
line; and who shall decide how far a face may be masked when the
uncherishing years have thrust it far onward in the ever-new procession
of youth and age? The good-humor of the glance remained and shone out
in a motherly way at Deronda, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, in a mild guttural tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I serve you, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to look at the silver clasps in the window,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda; <div class="bookquote">``the larger ones, please, in the corner there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>They were not quite easy to get at from the mother's station, and the
son seeing this called out, <div class="bookquote">``I'll reach 'em, mother; I'll reach 'em,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>running forward with alacrity, and then handing the clasps to Deronda
with the smiling remark--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother's too proud: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) wants to do everything herself. That's why I
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) to wait on you, sir. When there's a particular gentleman
customer, sir, I daren't do any other than call her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). But I can't let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) do herself mischief with stretching.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mr. Cohen made way again for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) parent, who gave a little
guttural, amiable laugh while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at Deronda, as much as to say,
<div class="bookquote">``This boy will be at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) jokes, but you see he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s the best son in the
world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda</b></font>)</div>and evidently the son enjoyed pleasing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) also
wished to convey an apology to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) distinguished customer for not
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own exclusive attention.

<p/>Deronda began to examine the clasps as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had many points to observe
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could come to a decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are only three guineas, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, encouragingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First-rate workmanship, sir--worth twice the money; only I get 'em a
bargain from Cologne,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son, parenthetically, from a distance.

<p/>Meanwhile two new customers entered, and the repeated call, <div class="bookquote">``Addy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>customers</b></font>)</div>brought from the back of the shop a group that Deronda turned frankly
to stare at, feeling sure that the stare would be held complimentary.
The group consisted of a black-eyed young woman who carried a
black-eyed little one, its head already covered with black curls, and
deposited it on the counter, from which station it looked round with
even more than the usual intelligence of babies: also a robust boy of
six and a younger girl, both with black eyes and black-ringed
hair--looking more Semitic than their parents, as the puppy lions show
the spots of far-off progenitors. The young woman answering to
<div class="bookquote">``Addy'' (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>--a sort of paroquet in a bright blue dress, with coral necklace
and earrings, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair set up in a huge bush--looked as complacently
lively and unrefined as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband; and by a certain difference from
the mother deepened in Deronda the unwelcome impression that the latter
was not so utterly common a Jewess as to exclude her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being the mother
of Mirah. While that thought was glancing through his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind, the boy had
run forward into the shop with an energetic stamp, and setting himself
about four feet from Deronda, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hands in the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
miniature knickerbockers, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with a precocious air of
survey. Perhaps it was chiefly with a diplomatic design to linger and
ingratiate himself that Deronda patted the boy's head, saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your name, sirrah?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jacob Alexander Cohen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the small man, with much ease and
distinctness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not named after your father, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, after my grandfather; he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) sells knives and razors and scissors--my
grandfather does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, wishing to impress the stranger with
that high connection. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) gave me this knife.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Here a pocket-knife was
drawn forth, and the small fingers, both naturally and artificially
dark, opened two blades and a cork-screw with much quickness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is not that a dangerous plaything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, turning to the
grandmother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)_'ll never hurt himself, bless you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>), contemplating her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>)
grandson with placid rapture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have _you_ got a knife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>says Jacob, coming closer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) small voice
was hoarse in its glibness, as if it belonged to an aged commercial
soul, fatigued with bargaining through many generations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Do you want to see it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, taking a small penknife
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket.

<p/>Jacob seized it immediately and retreated a little, holding the two
knives in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) palms and bending over them in meditative comparison. By
this time the other clients were gone, and the whole family had
gathered to the spot, centering their attention on the marvelous Jacob:
the father, mother, and grandmother behind the counter, with baby held
staggering thereon, and the little girl in front leaning at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
brother's elbow to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in looking at the knives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine's the best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, at last, returning Deronda's knife as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) had been entertaining the idea of exchange and had rejected it.

<p/>Father and mother laughed aloud with delight. <div class="bookquote">``You won't find Jacob
choosing the worst,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cohen, winking, with much confidence in
the customer's admiration. Deronda, looking at the grandmother, who had
only an inward silent laugh, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are these the only grandchildren you have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All. This is my only son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) answered in a communicative tone,
Deronda's glance and manner as usual conveying the impression of
sympathetic interest--which on this occasion answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) purpose well.
It seemed to come naturally enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have no daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an instantaneous change in the mother's face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lips closed
more firmly, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked down, swept her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands outward on the counter,
and finally turned her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back on Deronda to examine some Indian
handkerchiefs that hung in pawn behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son gave a significant
glance, set up his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) shoulders an instant and just put his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fingers to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
lips,--then said quickly, <div class="bookquote">``I think you're a first-rate gentleman in the
city, sir, if I may be allowed to guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with a preoccupied air, <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to do with
the city.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a bad job. I thought you might be the young principal of a
first-rate firm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cohen, wishing to make amends for the check
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) customer's natural desire to know more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But you
understand silver-work, I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, taking up the clasps a moment and laying them
down again. That unwelcome bit of circumstantial evidence had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
mind busy with a plan which was certainly more like acting than
anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been aware of in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own conduct before. But the bare
possibility that more knowledge might nullify the evidence now
overpowered the inclination to rest in uncertainty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To tell you the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``my errand is not so much to buy
as to borrow. I dare say you go into rather heavy transactions
occasionally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, I've accommodated gentlemen of distinction--I'm proud to
say it. I wouldn't exchange my business with any in the world. There's
none more honorable, nor more charitable, nor more necessary for all
classes, from the good lady who wants a little of the ready for the
baker, to a gentleman like yourself, sir, who may want it for
amusement. I like my business, I like my street, and I like my shop. I
wouldn't have it a door further down. And I wouldn't be without a
pawn-shop, sir, to be the Lord Mayor. It puts you in connection with
the world at large. I say it's like the government revenue--it embraces
the brass as well as the gold of the country. And a man who doesn't get
money, sir, can't accommodate. Now, what can I do for _you_, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Solomon</b></font>)</div><p/>If an amiable self-satisfaction is the mark of earthly bliss, Solomon
in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) glory was a pitiable mortal compared with Mr. Cohen--clearly
one of those persons, who, being in excellent spirits about themselves,
are willing to cheer strangers by letting them know it. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) was
delivering himself with lively rapidity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) took the baby from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) wife
and holding it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) arm presented his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) features to be explored by its
small fists. Deronda, not in a cheerful mood, was rashly pronouncing
this Ezra Cohen to be the most unpoetic Jew he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) had ever met with in
books or life: his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) phraseology was as little as possible like that of
the Old Testament: and no shadow of a suffering race distinguished his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>)
vulgarity of soul from that of a prosperous, pink-and-white huckster of
the purest English lineage. It is naturally a Christian feeling that a
Jew ought not to be conceited. However, this was no reason for not
persevering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) project, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) answered at once in adventurous
ignorance of technicalities--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a fine diamond ring to offer as security--not with me at this
moment, unfortunately, for I am not in the habit of wearing it. But I
will come again this evening and bring it with me. Fifty pounds at once
would be a convenience to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, this evening is the Sabbath, young gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said
Cohen, <div class="bookquote">``and I go to the _Shool_. The shop will be closed. But
accommodation is a work of charity; if you can't get here before, and
are any ways pressed--why, I'll look at your diamond. You're perhaps
from the West End--a longish drive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and your Sabbath begins early at this season. I could be here by
five--will that do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda had not been without hope that by asking
to come on a Friday evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might get a better opportunity of
observing points in the family character, and might even be able to put
some decisive question.

<p/>Cohen assented; but here the marvelous Jacob, whose _physique_
supported a precocity that would have shattered a Gentile of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) years,
showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) had been listening with much comprehension by saying,
<div class="bookquote">``You are coming again. Have you got any more knives at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I have one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, smiling down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it two blades and a hook--and a white handle like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said
Jacob, pointing to the waistcoat-pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it has?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like a cork-screw?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, exhibiting that article in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
own knife again, and looking up with serious inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, experimentally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring your knife, then, and we'll shwop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, returning the
knife to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) pocket, and stamping about with the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) had
concluded a good transaction.

<p/>The grandmother had now recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) usual manners, and the whole
family watched Deronda radiantly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) caressingly lifted the little
girl, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not hitherto given attention, and seating her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on
the counter, asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name also. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in silence, and
put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fingers to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gold earrings, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) did not seem to have
noticed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Adelaide Rebekah is her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) name,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, proudly. <div class="bookquote">``Speak to the
gentleman, lovey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shlav'm Shabbes fyock on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adelaide Rebekah/Rebekah</b></font>)</div>said Adelaide Rebekah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) Sabbath frock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) means,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father, in explanation.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>)'ll have her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) Sabbath frock on this evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will you let me see you in it, Adelaide?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with that
gentle intonation which came very easily to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say yes, lovey--yes, if you please, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) mother, enchanted
with this handsome young gentleman, who appreciated remarkable children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And will you give me a kiss this evening?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda with a hand on
each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) little brown shoulders.

<p/>Adelaide Rebekah -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) miniature crinoline and monumental features
corresponded with the combination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) names-RRB- immediately put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>)
lips to pay the kiss in advance; whereupon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) father rising in still
more glowing satisfaction with the general meritoriousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
circumstances, and with the stranger who was an admiring witness, said
cordially--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see there's somebody will be disappointed if you don't come this
evening, sir. You won't mind sitting down in our family place and
waiting a bit for me, if I'm not in when you come, sir? I'll stretch a
point to accommodate a gent of your sort. Bring the diamond, and I'll
see what I can do for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an witness</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda thus left the most favorable impression behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), as a
preparation for more easy intercourse. But for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own part those
amenities had been carried on under the heaviest spirits. If these were
really Mirah's relatives, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not imagine that even her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) fervid
filial piety could give the reunion with them any sweetness beyond such
as could be found in the strict fulfillment of a painful duty. What did
this vaunting brother need? And with the most favorable supposition
about the hypothetic mother, Deronda shrank from the image of a first
meeting between her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and Mirah, and still more from the idea of Mirah's
domestication with this family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) took refuge in disbelief. To find an
Ezra Cohen when the name was running in your head was no more
extraordinary than to find a Josiah Smith under like circumstances; and
as to the coincidence about the daughter, it would probably turn out to
be a difference. If, however, further knowledge confirmed the more
undesirable conclusion, what would be wise expediency?--to try and
determine the best consequences by concealment, or to brave other
consequences for the sake of that openness which is the sweet fresh air
of our moral life.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Er ist geheissen
Israel. Ihn hat verwandelt
Hexenspruch in elnen Hund.
* * * * *
Aber jeden Freitag Abend,
In der Dämmrungstunde, plötzlich
Weicht der Zauber, und der Hund
Wird aufs Neu' ein menschlich Wesen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--HEINE: _Prinzessin Sabbaz_.


<p/>When Deronda arrived at five o'clock, the shop was closed and the door
was opened for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) by the Christian servant. When she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) into
the room behind the shop he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was surprised at the prettiness of the
scene. The house was old, and rather extensive at the back: probably
the large room he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) how entered was gloomy by daylight, but now it was
agreeably lit by a fine old brass lamp with seven oil-lights hanging
above the snow-white cloth spread on the central table, The ceiling and
walls were smoky, and all the surroundings were dark enough to throw
into relief the human figures, which had a Venetian glow of coloring.
The grandmother was arrayed in yellowish brown with a large gold chain
in lieu of the necklace, and by this light her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) yellow face with its
darkly-marked eyebrows and framing roll of gray hair looked as handsome
as was necessary for picturesque effect. Young Mrs. Cohen was clad in
red and black, with a string of large artificial pearls wound round and
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) neck: the baby lay asleep in the cradle under a scarlet
counterpane; Adelaide Rebekah was in braided amber, and Jacob Alexander
was in black velveteen with scarlet stockings. As the four pairs of
black eyes all glistened a welcome at Deronda, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) was almost ashamed of
the supercilious dislike these happy-looking creatures had raised in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) by daylight. Nothing could be more cordial than the greeting he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>)
received, and both mother and grandmother seemed to gather more dignity
from being seen on the private hearth, showing hospitality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) looked
round with some wonder at the old furniture: the oaken bureau and high
side-table must surely be mere matters of chance and economy, and not
due to the family taste. A large dish of blue and yellow ware was set
up on the side-table, and flanking it were two old silver vessels; in
front of them a large volume in darkened vellum with a deep-ribbed
back. In the corner at the farther end was an open door into an inner
room, where there was also a light.

<p/>Deronda took in these details by parenthetic glances while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) met
Jacob's pressing solicitude about the knife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had taken the pains to
buy one with the requisites of the hook and white handle, and produced
it on demand, saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that the sort of thing you want, Jacob?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>It was subjected to a severe scrutiny, the hook and blades were opened,
and the article of barter with the cork-screw was drawn forth for
comparison.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you like a hook better than a cork-screw?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Caush I can get hold of things with a hook. A corkscrew won't go into
anything but corks. But it's better for you, you can draw corks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You agree to change, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, observing that the
grandmother was listening with delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What else have you got in your pockets?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, with deliberative
seriousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush, Jacob, love,''  (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div>said the grandmother. And Deronda, mindful
of discipline, answered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I must not tell you that. Our business was with the knives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Jacob looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) face scanningly for a moment or two, and
apparently arriving at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) conclusions, said gravely--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll shwop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>handing the cork-screw knife to Deronda, who pocketed it
with corresponding gravity.

<p/>Immediately the small son of Shem ran off into the next room, whence
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) voice was heard in rapid chat; and then ran back again--when,
seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father enter, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seized a little velveteen hat which lay on
a chair and put it on to approach him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). Cohen kept on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) own hat, and
took no notice of the visitor, but stood still while the two children
went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) and clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) knees: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) hands on each in
turn and uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) Hebrew benediction; whereupon the wife, who had
lately taken baby from the cradle, brought it up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband and
held it under his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) outstretched hands, to be blessed in its sleep. For
the moment, Deronda thought that this pawnbroker, proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
vocation, was not utterly prosaic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, you found your welcome in my family, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Cohen,
putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) hat and becoming his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) former self. <div class="bookquote">``And you've been
punctual. Nothing like a little stress here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) added, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>)
side pocket as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) sat down. <div class="bookquote">``It's good for us all in our turn. I've
felt it when I've had to make up payments. I began to fit every sort of
box. It's bracing to the mind. Now then! let us see, let us see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the ring I spoke of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, taking it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) finger.
<div class="bookquote">``I believe it cost a hundred pounds. It will be a sufficient pledge to
you for fifty, I think. I shall probably redeem it in a month or so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div><p/>Cohen's glistening eyes seemed to get a little nearer together as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
met the ingenuous look of this crude young gentleman, who apparently
supposed that redemption was a satisfaction to pawnbrokers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) took the
ring, examined and returned it, saying with indifference, <div class="bookquote">``Good, good.
We'll talk of it after our meal. Perhaps you'll join us, if you've no
objection. Me and my wife'll feel honored, and so will mother; won't
you, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>The invitation was doubly echoed, and Deronda gladly accepted it. All
now turned and stood round the table. No dish was at present seen
except one covered with a napkin; and Mrs. Cohen had placed a china
bowl near her (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) husband that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might wash his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands in it. But after
putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hat again, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) paused, and called in a loud voice,
<div class="bookquote">``Mordecai!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Can this be part of the religious ceremony? thought Deronda, not
knowing what might be expected of the ancient hero. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) heard a
<div class="bookquote">``Yes''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from the next room, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) look toward the open door; and
there, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) astonishment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw the figure of the enigmatic Jew whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had this morning met with in the book-shop. Their eyes met, and
Mordecai looked as much surprised as Deronda--neither in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) surprise
making any sign of recognition. But when Mordecai was seating himself
at the end of the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) just bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) head to the guest in a cold
and distant manner, as if the disappointment of the morning remained a
disagreeable association with this new acquaintance.

<p/>Cohen now washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) hands, pronouncing Hebrew words the while:
afterward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) took off the napkin covering the dish and disclosed the
two long flat loaves besprinkled with seed--the memorial of the manna
that fed the wandering forefathers--and breaking off small pieces gave
one to each of the family, including Adelaide Rebekah, who stood on the
chair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) whole length exhibited in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) amber-colored garment, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>)
little Jewish nose lengthened by compression of the lip in the effort
to make a suitable appearance. Cohen then uttered another Hebrew
blessing, and after that, the male heads were uncovered, all seated
themselves, and the meal went on without any peculiarity that
interested Deronda. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not very conscious of what dishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ate
from; being preoccupied with a desire to turn the conversation in a way
that would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to ask some leading question; and also thinking
of Mordecai, between whom and himself there was an exchange of
fascinated, half furtive glances. Mordecai had no handsome Sabbath
garment, but instead of the threadbare rusty black coat of the morning
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) wore one of light drab, which looked as if it had once been a
handsome loose paletot now shrunk with washing; and this change of
clothing gave a still stronger accentuation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) dark-haired, eager
face which might have belonged to the prophet Ezekiel--also probably
not modish in the eyes of contemporaries. It was noticeable that the
thin tails of the fried fish were given to Mordecai; and in general the
sort of share assigned to a poor relation--no doubt a <div class="bookquote">``survival''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>of
prehistoric practice, not yet generally admitted to be superstitious.

<p/>Mr. Cohen kept up the conversation with much liveliness, introducing as
subjects always in taste -LRB-the Jew is proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) loyalty-RRB- the Queen
and the Royal Family, the Emperor and Empress of the French--into which
both grandmother and wife entered with zest. Mrs. Cohen the younger
showed an accurate memory of distinguished birthdays; and the elder
assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) son in informing the guest of what occurred when the
Emperor and Empress were in England and visited the city ten years
before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you know all about it better than we do, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Cohen,
repeatedly, by way of preface to full information; and the interesting
statements were kept up in a trio.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our baby is named _Eu_genie Esther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cohen/Cohen</b></font>)</div>said young Mrs. Cohen,
vivaciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's wonderful how the Emperor's like a cousin of mine in the face,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div>said the grandmother; <div class="bookquote">``it struck me like lightning when I caught sight
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>). I couldn't have thought it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, and me went to see the Emperor and Empress at the Crystal
Palace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cohen. <div class="bookquote">``I had a fine piece of work to take care of,
mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might have been squeezed flat--though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was pretty near
as lusty then as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is now. I said if I had a hundred mothers I'd
never take one of 'em to see the Emperor and Empress at the Crystal
Palace again; and you may think a man can't afford it when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got but
one mother--not if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d ever so big an insurance on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) stroked
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) mother's shoulder affectionately, and chuckled a little at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) own
humor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother has been a widow a long while, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) opportunity. <div class="bookquote">``That has made your care for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the more
needful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, it's a good many _yore-zeit_ since I had to manage for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and
myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Cohen quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I went early to it. It's that makes you a
sharp knife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does--what makes a sharp knife, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) cheek
very much swollen with sweet-cake.

<p/>The father winked at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) guest and said, <div class="bookquote">``Having your nose put on the
grindstone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Jacob slipped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) chair with the piece of sweet-cake in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) hand,
and going close up to Mordecai, who had been totally silent hitherto,
said, <div class="bookquote">``What does that mean--putting my nose to the grindstone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It means that you are to bear being hurt without making a noise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said
Mordecai, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) eyes benignantly on the small face close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>).
Jacob put the corner of the cake into Mordecai's mouth as an invitation
to bite, saying meanwhile, <div class="bookquote">``I shan't though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>and keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) eyes on
the cake to observe how much of it went in this act of generosity.
Mordecai took a bite and smiled, evidently meaning to please the lad,
and the little incident made them both look more lovable. Deronda,
however, felt with some vexation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had taken little by his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy that is the right quarter for learning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), carrying on
the subject that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might have an excuse for addressing Mordecai, to
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) turned and said, <div class="bookquote">``You have been a great student, I imagine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have studied,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the quiet answer. <div class="bookquote">``And you?--You know German by
the book you were buying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have studied in Germany. Are you generally engaged in
bookselling?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I only go to Mr. Ram's shop every day to keep it while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ram</b></font>) goes to
meals,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, who was now looking at Deronda with what seemed
a revival of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) original interest: it seemed as if the face had some
attractive indication for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) which now neutralized the former
disappointment. After a slight pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you know
Hebrew?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to say, not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai's countenance fell: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) cast down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) eyelids, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
hands, which lay crossed before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), and said no more. Deronda had now
noticed more decisively than in their former interview a difficulty in
breathing, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought must be a sign of consumption.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had something else to do than to get book-learning.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Cohen,--<div class="bookquote">``I've had to make myself knowing about useful things. I know
stones well,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cohen</b></font>)</div>--here he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) pointed to Deronda's ring. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid of
taking that ring of yours at my own valuation. But now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) added, with
a certain drop in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) voice to a lower, more familiar nasal, <div class="bookquote">``what do
you want for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifty or sixty pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda answered, rather too carelessly.

<p/>Cohen paused a little, thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) pockets, fixed on
Deronda a pair of glistening eyes that suggested a miraculous
guinea-pig, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't do you that. Happy to oblige, but
couldn't go that lengths. Forty pound--say forty--I'll let you have
forty on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda was aware that Mordecai had looked up again at the words
implying a monetary affair, and was now examining him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) again, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``Very well, I shall redeem it in a month or so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. I'll make you out the ticket by-and-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Cohen,
indifferently. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) finger as a sign that conversation
must be deferred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>), Mordecai and Jacob put on their hats, and Cohen
opened a thanksgiving, which was carried on by responses, till Mordecai
delivered himself alone at some length, in a solemn chanting tone, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) chin slightly uplifted and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) thin hands clasped easily before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). Not only in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) accent and tone, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) freedom from the
self-consciousness which has reference to others' approbation, there
could hardly have been a stronger contrast to the Jew at the other end
of the table. It was an unaccountable conjunction--the presence among
these common, prosperous, shopkeeping types, of a man who, in an
emaciated threadbare condition, imposed a certain awe on Deronda, and
an embarrassment at not meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) expectations.

<p/>No sooner had Mordecai finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) devotional strain, than rising,
with a slight bend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) head to the stranger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) walked back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
room, and shut the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That seems to be rather a remarkable man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, turning to
Cohen, who immediately set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shoulders, put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tongue
slightly, and tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own brow. It was clearly to be understood that
Mordecai did not come up to the standard of sanity which was set by Mr.
Cohen's view of men and things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belong to your family?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/>This idea appeared to be rather ludicrous to the ladies as well as to
Cohen, and the family interchanged looks of amusement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Cohen. <div class="bookquote">``Charity! charity! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worked for me, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
got weaker and weaker I took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s an incumbrance; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brings
a blessing down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teaches the boy. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does the repairing
at the watches and jewelry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda hardly abstained from smiling at this mixture of kindliness and
the desire to justify it in the light of a calculation; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
willingness to speak further of Mordecai, whose character was made the
more enigmatically striking by these new details, was baffled. Mr.
Cohen immediately dismissed the subject by reverting to the
<div class="bookquote">``accommodation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cohen</b></font>)</div>which was also an act of charity, and proceeded to
make out the ticket, get the forty pounds, and present them both in
exchange for the diamond ring. Deronda, feeling that it would be hardly
delicate to protract his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) visit beyond the settlement of the business
which was its pretext, had to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) leave, with no more decided
result than the advance of forty pounds and the pawn-ticket in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
breast-pocket, to make a reason for returning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) came up to town
after Christmas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would then endeavor to gain a
little more insight into the character and history of Mordecai; from
whom also he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) might gather something decisive about the Cohens--for
example, the reason why it was forbidden to ask Mrs. Cohen the elder
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) had a daughter.




<p/>BOOK V.--MORDECAI.


<p/>CHAPTER XXXV.

<p/>Were uneasiness of conscience measured by extent of crime, human
history had been different, and one should look to see the contrivers
of greedy wars and the mighty marauders of the money-market in one
troop of self-lacerating penitents with the meaner robber and
cut-purse and the murderer that doth his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) butchery in small with his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) own
hand. No doubt wickedness hath its rewards to distribute; but who so
wins in this devil's game must needs be baser, more cruel, more brutal
than the order of this planet will allow for the multitude born of
woman, the most of these carrying a form of conscience--a fear which
is the shadow of justice, a pity which is the shadow of love--that
hindereth from the prize of serene wickedness, itself difficult of
maintenance in our composite flesh.


<p/>On the twenty-ninth of December Deronda knew that the Grandcourts had
arrived at the Abbey, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had had no glimpse of them before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went
to dress for dinner. There had been a splendid fall of snow, allowing
the party of children the rare pleasures of snow-balling and
snow-building, and in the Christmas holidays the Mallinger girls were
content with no amusement unless it were joined in and managed by
<div class="bookquote">``cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Mallinger girls</b></font>)</div>as they had always called Deronda. After that outdoor
exertion he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been playing billiards, and thus the hours had passed
without his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) dwelling at all on the prospect of meeting Gwendolen at
dinner. Nevertheless that prospect was interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>); and when, a
little tired and heated with working at amusement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) room
before the half-hour bell had rung, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) began to think of it with some
speculation on the sort of influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) marriage with Grandcourt would
have on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and on the probability that there would be some
discernible shades of change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) manner since he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) at Diplow,
just as there had been since his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) first vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) at Leubronn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy there are some natures one could see growing or degenerating
every day, if one watched them,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose some of us
go on faster than others: and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is a creature who keeps
strong traces of anything that has once impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). That little
affair of the necklace, and the idea that somebody thought her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gambling
wrong, had evidently bitten into her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). But such impressibility leads
both ways: it may drive one to desperation as soon as to anything
better. And whatever fascinations Grandcourt may have for capricious
tastes--good heavens! who can believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would call out the tender
affections in daily companionship? One might be tempted to horsewhip
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) for the sake of getting some show of passion into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) face and
speech. I'm afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) out of ambition--to escape poverty.
But why did she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) run out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) way at first? The poverty came after,
though. Poor thing! she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) may have been urged into it. How can one feel
anything else than pity for a young creature like that--full of unused
life--ignorantly rash--hanging all her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blind expectations on that
remnant of a human being.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Doubtless the phrases which Deronda's meditation applied to the
bridegroom were the less complimentary for the excuses and pity in
which it clad the bride. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) notion of Grandcourt as a <div class="bookquote">``remnant''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>was
founded on no particular knowledge, but simply on the impression which
ordinary polite intercourse had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) that Grandcourt had worn out
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) natural healthy interest in things.

<p/>In general, one may be sure that whenever a marriage of any mark takes
place, male acquaintances are likely to pity the bride, female
acquaintances the bridegroom: each, it is thought, might have done
better; and especially where the bride is charming, young gentlemen on
the scene are apt to conclude that she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) can have no real attachment to a
fellow so uninteresting to themselves as her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) husband, but has married
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on other grounds. Who, under such circumstances, pities the
husband? Even his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) female friends are apt to think his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) position
retributive: he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should have chosen some one else. But perhaps Deronda
may be excused that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) did not prepare any pity for Grandcourt, who had
never struck acquaintances as likely to come out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) experiences
with more suffering than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) inflicted; whereas, for Gwendolen, young,
headlong, eager for pleasure, fed with the flattery which makes a
lovely girl believe in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) divine right to rule--how quickly might life
turn from expectancy to a bitter sense of the irremediable! After what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had seen of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) must have had rather dull feelings not to have
looked forward with some interest to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) entrance into the room. Still,
since the honeymoon was already three weeks in the distance, and
Gwendolen had been enthroned, not only at Ryelands, but at Diplow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was likely to have composed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) countenance with suitable manifestation
or concealment, not being one who would indulge the curious by a
helpless exposure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feelings.

<p/>A various party had been invited to meet the new couple; the old
aristocracy was represented by Lord and Lady Pentreath; the old gentry
by young Mr. and Mrs. Fitzadam of the Worcestershire branch of the
Fitzadams; politics and the public good, as specialized in the cider
interest, by Mr. Fenn, member for West Orchards, accompanied by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) two
daughters; Lady Mallinger's family, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) brother, Mr. Raymond, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wife; the useful bachelor element by Mr. Sinker, the eminent
counsel, and by Mr. Vandernoodt, whose acquaintance Sir Hugo had found
pleasant enough at Leubronn to be adopted in England.

<p/>All had assembled in the drawing-room before the new couple appeared.
Meanwhile, the time was being passed chiefly in noticing the
children--various little Raymonds, nephews and nieces of Lady
Mallinger's with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) own three girls, who were always allowed to appear
at this hour. The scene was really delightful--enlarged by full-length
portraits with deep backgrounds, inserted in the cedar
paneling--surmounted by a ceiling that glowed with the rich colors of
the coats of arms ranged between the sockets--illuminated almost as
much by the red fire of oak-boughs as by the pale wax-lights--stilled
by the deep-piled carpet and by the high English breeding that subdues
all voices; while the mixture of ages, from the white-haired Lord and
Lady Pentreath to the four-year-old Edgar Raymond, gave a varied charm
to the living groups. Lady Mallinger, with fair matronly roundness and
mildly prominent blue eyes, moved about in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) black velvet, carrying a
tiny white dog on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) arm as a sort of finish to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) costume; the
children were scattered among the ladies, while most of the gentlemen
were standing rather aloof, conversing with that very moderate vivacity
observable during the long minutes before dinner. Deronda was a little
out of the circle in a dialogue fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) by Mr. Vandernoodt, a
man of the best Dutch blood imported at the revolution: for the rest,
one of those commodious persons in society who are nothing particular
themselves, but are understood to be acquainted with the best in every
department; close-clipped, pale-eyed, _nonchalant_, as good a foil as
could well be found to the intense coloring and vivid gravity of
Deronda.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was talking of the bride and bridegroom, whose appearance was being
waited for. Mr. Vandernoodt was an industrious gleaner of personal
details, and could probably tell everything about a great philosopher
or physicist except his (<font color='blue'><b>physicist</b></font>) theories or discoveries; he (<font color='blue'><b>physicist</b></font>) was now implying
that he (<font color='blue'><b>physicist</b></font>) had learned many facts about Grandcourt since meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>physicist</b></font>) at
Leubronn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Men who have seen a good deal of life don't always end by choosing
their wives so well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) has had rather an anecdotic history--gone
rather deep into pleasures, I fancy, lazy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is. But, of course, you
know all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, in an indifferent tone. <div class="bookquote">``I know little more
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is Sir Hugo's nephew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vandernoodt/Vandernoodt</b></font>)</div><p/>But now the door opened and deferred any satisfaction of Mr.
Vandernoodt's communicativeness.

<p/>The scene was one to set off any figure of distinction that entered on
it, and certainly when Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt entered, no beholder
could deny that their figures had distinction. The bridegroom had
neither more nor less easy perfection of costume, neither more nor less
well-cut impassibility of face, than before his (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) marriage. It was to be
supposed of him (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) would put up with nothing less than the best in
outward equipment, wife included; and the bride was what he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) might have
been expected to choose. <div class="bookquote">``By George, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s handsomer, if
anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vandernoodt/Vandernoodt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vandernoodt. And Deronda was of the same opinion,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said nothing. The white silk and diamonds--it may seem strange,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) did wear diamonds on her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) neck, in her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) ears, in her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hair--might
have something to do with the new imposingness of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) beauty, which
flashed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as more unquestionable if not more thoroughly
satisfactory than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had first seen her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) at the gaming-table. Some
faces which are peculiar in their beauty are like original works of
art: for the first time they are almost always met with question. But
in seeing Gwendolen at Diplow, Deronda had discerned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) more than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had expected of that tender appealing charm which we call womanly.
Was there any new change since then? He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) distrusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) impressions; but
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) receiving greetings with what seemed a proud cold
quietude and a superficial smile, there seemed to be at work within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
the same demonic force that had possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
resolute glance and turned away a loser from the gaming-table. There
was no time for more of a conclusion--no time even for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
greeting before the summons to dinner.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sat not far from opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) at table, and could sometimes hear
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said in answer to Sir Hugo, who was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) liveliest in
conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); but though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) looked toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with the
intention of bowing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) no opportunity of doing so for some
time. At last Sir Hugo, who might have imagined that they had already
spoken to each other, said, <div class="bookquote">``Deronda, you will like to hear what Mrs.
Grandcourt tells me about your favorite Klesmer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen's eyelids had been lowered, and Deronda, already looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) discovered a quivering reluctance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was obliged to
raise them and return his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) unembarrassed bow and smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own smile
being one of the lip merely. It was but an instant, and Sir Hugo
continued without pause--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Arrowpoints have condoned the marriage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) is spending the
Christmas with his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) bride at Quetcham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) will be glad of it for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) wife, else I dare
say he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) would not have minded keeping at a distance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a sort of troubadour story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pentreath, an easy,
deep-voiced old lady; <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to find a little romance left among us.
I think our young people now are getting too worldly wise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shows the Arrowpoints' good sense, however, to have adopted the
affair, after the fuss in the paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo. <div class="bookquote">``And disowning
your own child because of a _mésalliance_ is something like disowning
your one eye: everybody knows it's yours, and you have no other to make
an appearance with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to _mésalliance_, there's no blood on any side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Pentreath. <div class="bookquote">``Old Admiral Arrowpoint was one of Nelson's men, you know--a
doctor's son. And we all know how the mother's money came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If they were any _mésalliance_ in the case, I should say it was on
Klesmer's side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you think it is a case of the immortal marrying the mortal. What
is your opinion?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, looking at Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt that Herr Klesmer thinks himself immortal. But I dare
say his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) wife will burn as much incense before him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) requires,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had recovered any composure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might have lost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you approve of a wife burning incense before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Sir Hugo, with an air of jocoseness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, <div class="bookquote">``if it were only to make others believe in
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) paused a moment and then said with more gayety, <div class="bookquote">``When Herr
Klesmer admires his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) own genius, it will take off some of the absurdity
if his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) wife says Amen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Klesmer is no favorite of yours, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think very highly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>), I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) genius
is quite above my judgment, and I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) to be exceedingly generous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoke with the sudden seriousness which is often meant to correct
an unfair or indiscreet sally, having a bitterness against Klesmer in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) secret soul which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew herself unable to justify. Deronda was
wondering what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should have thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had never heard of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) before: probably that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) put on a little hardness and defiance by
way of concealing some painful consciousness--if, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could
imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) manners otherwise than in the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) suspicion. But
why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) not recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with more friendliness?

<p/>Sir Hugo, by way of changing the subject, said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Is not this a
beautiful room? It was part of the refectory of the Abbey. There was a
division made by those pillars and the three arches, and afterward they
were built up. Else it was half as large again originally. There used
to be rows of Benedictines sitting where we are sitting. Suppose we
were suddenly to see the lights burning low and the ghosts of the old
monks rising behind all our chairs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a playful shudder. <div class="bookquote">``It is very
nice to come after ancestors and monks, but they should know their
places and keep underground. I should be rather frightened to go about
this house all alone. I suppose the old generations must be angry with
us because we have altered things so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the ghosts must be of all political parties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo. <div class="bookquote">``And
those fellows who wanted to change things while they lived and couldn't
do it must be on our side. But if you would not like to go over the
house alone, you will like to go in company, I hope. You and Grandcourt
ought to see it all. And we will ask Deronda to go round with us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is
more learned about it than I am.''  (<font color='red'><b>The baronet</b></font>)</div>The baronet was in the most
complaisant of humors.

<p/>Gwendolen stole a glance at Deronda, who must have heard what Sir Hugo
said, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) face turned toward them helping himself to an
_entrée_; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) looked as impassive as a picture. At the notion of
Deronda's showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and Grandcourt the place which was to be theirs,
and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with painful emphasis remembered might have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
-LRB-perhaps, if others had acted differently-RRB-, certain thoughts had rushed
in--thoughts repeated within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), but now returning on an occasion
embarrassingly new; and was conscious of something furtive and awkward
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) glance which Sir Hugo must have noticed. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) usual
readiness of resource against betrayal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, playfully, <div class="bookquote">``You don't
know how much I am afraid of Mr. Deronda.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's that? Because you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) too learned?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, whom
the peculiarity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) glance had not escaped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. It is ever since I first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) at Leubronn. Because when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) came
to look on at the roulette-table, I began to lose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) cast an evil eye
on my play. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) didn't approve it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) has told me so. And now whatever I
do before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) will cast an evil eye upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gad! I'm rather afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) myself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) doesn't approve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Sir Hugo, glancing at Deronda; and then turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) face toward
Gwendolen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) said less audibly, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think ladies generally object
to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes upon them.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The baronet's small chronic complaint of
facetiousness was at this moment almost as annoying to Gwendolen as it
often was to Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I object to any eyes that are critical,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, in a cool, high
voice, with a turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck. <div class="bookquote">``Are there many of these old rooms left
in the Abbey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not many. There is a fine cloistered court with a long gallery above
it. But the finest bit of all is turned into stables. It is part of the
old church. When I improved the place I made the most of every other
bit; but it was out of my reach to change the stables, so the horses
have the benefit of the fine old choir. You must go and see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall like to see the horses as well as the building,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have no stud to speak of. Grandcourt will look with contempt at
my horses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo. <div class="bookquote">``I've given up hunting, and go on in a
jog-trot way, as becomes an old gentlemen with daughters. The fact is,
I went in for doing too much at this place. We all lived at Diplow for
two years while the alterations were going on: Do you like Diplow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not particularly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with indifference. One would have
thought that the young lady had all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life had more family seats than
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cared to go to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! it will not do after Ryelands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, well pleased.
<div class="bookquote">``Grandcourt, I know, took it for the sake of the hunting. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) found
something so much better there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>added the baronet, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) voice,
<div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) might well prefer it to any other place in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has one attraction for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, passing over this
compliment with a chill smile, <div class="bookquote">``that it is within reach of Offendene.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, and then let the subject drop.

<p/>What amiable baronet can escape the effect of a strong desire for a
particular possession? Sir Hugo would have been glad that Grandcourt,
with or without reason, should prefer any other place to Diplow; but
inasmuch as in the pure process of wishing we can always make the
conditions of our gratification benevolent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) did wish that
Grandcourt's convenient disgust for Diplow should not be associated
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) marriage with this very charming bride. Gwendolen was much to
the baronet's taste, but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) observed afterward to Lady Mallinger,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should never have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) for a young girl who had married beyond
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) expectations.

<p/>Deronda had not heard much of this conversation, having given his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
attention elsewhere, but the glimpses he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had of Gwendolen's manner
deepened the impression that it had something newly artificial.

<p/>Later, in the drawing-room, Deronda, at somebody's request, sat down to
the piano and sang. Afterward, Mrs. Raymond took his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) place; and on
rising he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) observed that Gwendolen had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seat, and had come to
this end of the room, as if to listen more fully, but was now standing
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) back to every one, apparently contemplating a fine cowled head
carved in ivory which hung over a small table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) longed to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
and speak. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) not obey such an impulse, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would have
done toward any other lady in the room? Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hesitated some moments,
observing the graceful lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) back, but not moving.

<p/>If you have any reason for not indulging a wish to speak to a fair
woman, it is a bad plan to look long at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back: the wish to see what
it screens becomes the stronger. There may be a very sweet smile on the
other side. Deronda ended by going to the end of the small table, at
right angles to Gwendolen's position, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could speak she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) no smile, but such an appealing look of sadness, so
utterly different from the chill effort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) recognition at table,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) speech was checked. For what was an appreciative space of time
to both, though the observation of others could not have measured it,
they looked at each other--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seeming to take the deep rest of
confession, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with an answering depth of sympathy that neutralized all
other feelings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you not join in the music?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said by way of meeting the
necessity for speech.

<p/>That her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) look of confession had been involuntary was shown by that just
perceptible shake and change of countenance with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) roused
herself to reply calmly, <div class="bookquote">``I join in it by listening. I am fond of
music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you not a musician?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have given a great deal of time to music. But I have not talent
enough to make it worth while. I shall never sing again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you are fond of music, it will always be worth while in
private, for your own delight. I make it a virtue to be content with my
middlingness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, smiling; <div class="bookquote">``it is always pardonable, so that
one does not ask others to take it for superiority.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot imitate you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tone of
artificial vivacity. <div class="bookquote">``To be middling with me is another phrase for
being dull. And the worst fault I have to find with the world is, that
it is dull. Do you know, I am going to justify gambling in spite of
you. It is a refuge from dullness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't admit the justification,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``I think what we call
the dullness of things is a disease in ourselves. Else how can any one
find an intense interest in life? And many do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I see! The fault I find in the world is my own fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). Then after a moment, looking up at the ivory
again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Do _you_ never find fault with the world or with
others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. When I am in a grumbling mood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And hate people? Confess you hate them when they stand in your
way--when their gain is your loss? That is your own phrase, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are often standing in each other's way when we can't help it. I
think it is stupid to hate people on that ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if they injure you and could have helped it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen with
a hard intensity unaccountable in incidental talk like this.

<p/>Deronda wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) choice of subjects. A painful impression
arrested his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answer a moment, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, with a graver,
deeper intonation, <div class="bookquote">``Why, then, after all, I prefer my place to theirs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There I believe you are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a sudden little
laugh, and turned to join the group at the piano.

<p/>Deronda looked around for Grandcourt, wondering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
bride's movements with any attention; but it was rather undiscerning to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could find out the fact. Grandcourt had a
delusive mood of observing whatever had an interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), which
could be surpassed by no sleepy-eyed animal on the watch for prey. At
that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was plunged in the depth of an easy chair, being talked
to by Mr. Vandernoodt, who apparently thought the acquaintance of such
a bridegroom worth cultivating; and an incautious person might have
supposed it safe to telegraph secrets in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>), the common
prejudice being that your quick observer is one whose eyes have quick
movements. Not at all. If you want a respectable witness who will see
nothing inconvenient, choose a vivacious gentleman, very much on the
alert, with two eyes wide open, a glass in one of them, and an entire
impartiality as to the purpose of looking. If Grandcourt cared to keep
any one under his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) power he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) saw them out of the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) long
narrow eyes, and if they went behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had a constructive process
by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knew what they were doing there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knew perfectly well
where his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wife was, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was behaving. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) going to be a
jealous husband? Deronda imagined that to be likely; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
imagination was as much astray about Grandcourt as it would have been
about an unexplored continent where all the species were peculiar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
did not conceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) himself was a likely subject of jealousy, or
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should give any pretext for it; but the suspicion that a wife
is not happy naturally leads one to speculate on the husband's private
deportment; and Deronda found himself after one o'clock in the morning
in the rather ludicrous position of sitting up severely holding a
Hebrew grammar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hands -LRB-for somehow, in deference to Mordecai, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
had begun to study Hebrew-RRB-, with the consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had been in
that attitude nearly an hour, and had thought of nothing but Gwendolen
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband. To be an unusual young man means for the most part to
get a difficult mastery over the usual, which is often like the sprite
of ill-luck you pack up your goods to escape from, and see grinning at
you from the top of your luggage van. The peculiarities of Deronda's
nature had been acutely touched by the brief incident and words which
made the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) intercourse with Gwendolen; and this evening's
slight addition had given them an importunate recurrence. It was not
vanity--it was ready sympathy that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) alive to a certain
appealingness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) behavior toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>); and the difficulty with which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had seemed to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes to bow to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), in the first instance,
was to be interpreted now by that unmistakable look of involuntary
confidence which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had afterward turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) under the
consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) approach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the use of it all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>thought Deronda, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
grammar, and began to undress. <div class="bookquote">``I can't do anything to help her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)--nobody
can, if she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) has found out her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) mistake already. And it seems to me that
she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) has a dreary lack of the ideas that might help her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>). Strange and
piteous to human flesh like that might be, wrapped round with fine
raiment, her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) ears pierced for gems, her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) head held loftily, her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) mouth
all smiling pretence, the poor soul within her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) sitting in sick distaste
of all things! But what do I know of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)? There may be a demon in her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)
to match the worst husband, for what I can tell. She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was clearly an
ill-educated, worldly girl: perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) is a coquette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>This last reflection, not much believed in, was a self-administered
dose of caution, prompted partly by Sir Hugo's much-contemned joking on
the subject of flirtation. Deronda resolved not to volunteer any
_tete-à-tete_ with Gwendolen during the days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stay at the Abbey;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was capable of keeping a resolve in spite of much inclination to
the contrary.

<p/>But a man cannot resolve about a woman's actions, least of all about
those of a woman like Gwendolen, in whose nature there was a
combination of proud reserve with rashness, of perilously poised terror
with defiance, which might alternately flatter and disappoint control.
Few words could less represent her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) than <div class="bookquote">``coquette.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had native love
of homage, and belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own power; but no cold artifice for the
sake of enslaving. And the poor thing's belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
other dreams before marriage, had often to be thrust aside now like the
toys of a sick child, which it looks at with dull eyes, and has no
heart to play with, however it may try.

<p/>The next day at lunch Sir Hugo said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``The thaw has gone on like
magic, and it's so pleasant out of doors just now--shall we go and see
the stables and the other odd bits about the place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, pray,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``You will like to see the stables,
Henleigh?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) added, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncommonly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, with an indifference which seemed to
give irony to the word, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) look. It was the first time
Deronda had seen them speak to each other since their arrival, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
thought their exchange of looks as cold or official as if it had been a
ceremony to keep up a charter. Still, the English fondness for reserve
will account for much negation; and Grandcourt's manners with an extra
veil of reserve over them might be expected to present the extreme type
of the national taste.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who else is inclined to make the tour of the house and premises?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Sir Hugo. <div class="bookquote">``The ladies must muffle themselves; there is only just about
time to do it well before sunset. You will go, Dan, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, carelessly, knowing that Sir Hugo would think
any excuse disobliging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All meet in the library, then, when they are ready--say in half an
hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet. Gwendolen made herself ready with wonderful
quickness, and in ten minutes came down into the library in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sables,
plume, and little thick boots. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) entered the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
aware that some one else was there: it was precisely what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had hoped
for. Deronda was standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) back toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) at the far end of
the room, and was looking over a newspaper. How could little thick
boots make any noise on an Axminster carpet? And to cough would have
seemed an intended signaling which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pride could not condescend to;
also, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt bashful about walking up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) know
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was there, though it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hunger to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) which had
set her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination on constructing this chance of finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hurry down, as birds hover near the water which they dare not
drink. Always uneasily dubious about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt a
peculiar anxiety to-day, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with contempt, as
one triumphantly conscious of being Grandcourt's wife, the future lady
of this domain. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) habitual effort now to magnify the
satisfactions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pride, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nourished her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) strength; but
somehow Deronda's being there disturbed them all. There was not the
faintest touch of coquetry in the attitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
was unique to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) among men, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as being not
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) admirer but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) superior: in some mysterious way he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was becoming a
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) conscience, as one woman whose nature is an object of
reverential belief may become a new conscience to a man.

<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not look round and find out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was there! The
paper crackled in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head rose and sank, exploring those
stupid columns, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was evidently stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beard; as if this
world were a very easy affair to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Of course all the rest of the
company would soon be down, and the opportunity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saying something
to efface her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) flippancy of the evening before, would be quite gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
felt sick with irritation--so fast do young creatures like her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) absorb
misery through invisible suckers of their own fancies--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face had
gathered that peculiar expression which comes with a mortification to
which tears are forbidden.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw down the paper and turned round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are there already,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, coming forward a step or two: <div class="bookquote">``I
must go and put on my coat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned aside and walked out of the room. This was behaving quite
badly. Mere politeness would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stay to exchange some words
before leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) alone. It was true that Grandcourt came in with Sir
Hugo immediately after, so that the words must have been too few to be
worth anything. As it was, they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) walking from the library door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A--you look rather ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, going straight up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
standing in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Do you feel equal
to the walk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, without the slightest movement
except this of the lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We could put off going over the house, you know, and only go out of
doors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, kindly, while Grandcourt turned aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, speaking with determination; <div class="bookquote">``let us put
off nothing. I want a long walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>The rest of the walking party--two ladies and two gentlemen besides
Deronda--had now assembled; and Gwendolen rallying, went with due
cheerfulness by the side of Sir Hugo, paying apparently an equal
attention to the commentaries Deronda was called upon to give on the
various architectural fragments, to Sir Hugo's reasons for not
attempting to remedy the mixture of the undisguised modern with the
antique--which in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) opinion only made the place the more truly
historical. On their way to the buttery and kitchen they took the
outside of the house and paused before a beautiful pointed doorway,
which was the only old remnant in the east front.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now, to my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, <div class="bookquote">``that is more interesting
standing as it is in the middle of what is frankly four centuries
later, than if the whole front had been dressed up in a pretense of the
thirteenth century. Additions ought to smack of the time when they are
made and carry the stamp of their period. I wouldn't destroy any old
bits, but that notion of reproducing the old is a mistake, I think. At
least, if a man likes to do it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whistle. Besides,
where are you to stop along that road--making loopholes where you don't
want to peep, and so on? You may as well ask me to wear out the stones
with kneeling; eh, Grandcourt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A confounded nuisance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>drawled Grandcourt. <div class="bookquote">``I hate fellows wanting to
howl litanies--acting the greatest bores that have ever existed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, that's what their romanticism must come to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo,
in a tone of confidential assent--<div class="bookquote">``that is if they carry it out
logically.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that way of arguing against a course because it may be ridden
down to an absurdity would soon bring life to a standstill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``It is not the logic of human action, but of a roasting-jack,
that must go on to the last turn when it has been once wound up. We can
do nothing safely without some judgment as to where we are to stop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I find the rule of the pocket the best guide,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo,
laughingly. <div class="bookquote">``And as for most of your new-old building, you had need to
hire men to scratch and chip it all over artistically to give it an
elderly-looking surface; which at the present rate of labor would not
answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to keep up the old fashions, then, Mr. Deronda?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, taking advantage of the freedom of grouping to fall back a
little, while Sir Hugo and Grandcourt went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some of them. I don't see why we should not use our choice there as we
do elsewhere--or why either age or novelty by itself is an argument for
or against. To delight in doing things because our fathers did them is
good if it shuts out nothing better; it enlarges the range of
affection--and affection is the broadest basis of good in life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen with a little surprise. <div class="bookquote">``I should
have thought you cared most about ideas, knowledge, wisdom, and all
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But to care about _them_ is a sort of affection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sudden _naïveté_. <div class="bookquote">``Call it attachment; interest, willing
to bear a great deal for the sake of being with them and saving them
from injury. Of course, it makes a difference if the objects of
interest are human beings; but generally in all deep affections the
objects are a mixture--half persons and half ideas--sentiments and
affections flow in together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether I understand that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
chin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) old saucy manner. <div class="bookquote">``I believe I am not very affectionate;
perhaps you mean to tell me, that is the reason why I don't see much
good in life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I did _not_ mean to tell you that; but I admit that I should think
it true if I believed what you say of yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, gravely.

<p/>Here Sir Hugo and Grandcourt turned round and paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never can get Mr. Deronda to pay me a compliment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.
<div class="bookquote">``I have quite a curiosity to see whether a little flattery can be
extracted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, glancing at Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``the fact is, it is useless
to flatter a bride. We give it up in despair. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) has been so fed on
sweet speeches that every thing we say seems tasteless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head and smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Grandcourt won me by neatly-turned compliments. If there had been one
word out of place it would have been fatal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you hear that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, looking at the husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, without change of countenance. <div class="bookquote">``It's a deucedly
hard thing to keep up, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>All this seemed to Sir Hugo a natural playfulness between such a
husband and wife; but Deronda wondered at the misleading alternations
in Gwendolen's manner, which at one moment seemed to excite sympathy by
childlike indiscretion, at another to repel it by proud concealment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
tried to keep out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) way by devoting himself to Miss Juliet Fenn, a
young lady whose profile had been so unfavorably decided by
circumstances over which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenn</b></font>) had no control, that Gwendolen some months
ago had felt it impossible to be jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Nevertheless, when
they were seeing the kitchen--a part of the original building in
perfect preservation--the depth of shadow in the niches of the
stone-walls and groined vault, the play of light from the huge glowing
fire on polished tin, brass, and copper, the fine resonance that came
with every sound of voice or metal, were all spoiled for Gwendolen, and
Sir Hugo's speech about them was made rather importunate, because
Deronda was discoursing to the other ladies and kept at a distance from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). It did not signify that the other gentlemen took the opportunity
of being near her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): of what use in the world was their admiration while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had an uneasy sense that there was some standard in Deronda's mind
which measured her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) into littleness? Mr. Vandernoodt, who had the mania
of always describing one thing while you were looking at another, was
quite intolerable with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vandernoodt</b></font>) insistence on Lord Blough's kitchen, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vandernoodt</b></font>) had seen in the north.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't ask us to see two kitchens at once. It makes the heat
double. I must really go out of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cried at last, marching
resolutely into the open air, and leaving the others in the rear.
Grandcourt was already out, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wondered how long you meant to stay in that damned place'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--one of
the freedoms he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had assumed as a husband being the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) strongest
epithets. Gwendolen, turning to see the rest of the party approach,
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was certainly rather too warm in one's wraps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>party</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked on the gravel across a green court, where the snow still
lay in islets on the grass, and in masses on the boughs of the great
cedar and the crenelated coping of the stone walls, and then into a
larger court, where there was another cedar, to find the beautiful
choir long ago turned into stables, in the first instance perhaps after
an impromptu fashion by troopers, who had a pious satisfaction in
insulting the priests of Baal and the images of Ashtoreth, the queen of
heaven. The exterior--its west end, save for the stable door, walled in
with brick and covered with ivy--was much defaced, maimed of finial and
gurgoyle, the friable limestone broken and fretted, and lending its
soft gray to a powdery dark lichen; the long windows, too, were filled
in with brick as far as the springing of the arches, the broad
clerestory windows with wire or ventilating blinds. With the low wintry
afternoon sun upon it, sending shadows from the cedar boughs, and
lighting up the touches of snow remaining on every ledge, it had still
a scarcely disturbed aspect of antique solemnity, which gave the scene
in the interior rather a startling effect; though, ecclesiastical or
reverential indignation apart, the eyes could hardly help dwelling with
pleasure on its piquant picturesqueness. Each finely-arched chapel was
turned into a stall, where in the dusty glazing of the windows there
still gleamed patches of crimson, orange, blue, and palest violet; for
the rest, the choir had been gutted, the floor leveled, paved, and
drained according to the most approved fashion, and a line of loose
boxes erected in the middle: a soft light fell from the upper windows
on sleek brown or gray flanks and haunches; on mild equine faces
looking out with active nostrils over the varnished brown boarding; on
the hay hanging from racks where the saints once looked down from the
altar-pieces, and on the pale golden straw scattered or in heaps; on a
little white-and-liver-colored spaniel making his (<font color='blue'><b>saints</b></font>) bed on the back of an
elderly hackney, and on four ancient angels, still showing signs of
devotion like mutilated martyrs--while over all, the grand pointed
roof, untouched by reforming wash, showed its lines and colors
mysteriously through veiling shadow and cobweb, and a hoof now and then
striking against the boards seemed to fill the vault with thunder,
while outside there was the answering bay of the blood-hounds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, this is glorious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen burst forth, in forgetfulness of
everything but the immediate impression: there had been a little
intoxication for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in the grand spaces of courts and building, and
the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) being an important person among them. <div class="bookquote">``This _is_
glorious! Only I wish there were a horse in every one of the boxes. I
would ten times rather have these stables than those at Diplow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had no sooner said this than some consciousness arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
and involuntarily she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes toward Deronda, who oddly enough
had taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt hat and stood holding it before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as if they
had entered a room or an actual church. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), like others, happened to be
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and their eyes met--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) intense vexation, for it
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that by looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had betrayed the reference of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thoughts, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt herself blushing: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) exaggerated the
impression that even Sir Hugo as well as Deronda would have of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) bad
taste in referring to the possession of anything at the Abbey: as for
Deronda, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had probably made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) annoyance at what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagined to be the obviousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) confusion robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
usual facility in carrying it off by playful speech, and turning up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
face to look at the roof, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wheeled away in that attitude. If any had
noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) blush as significant, they had certainly not interpreted it
by the secret windings and recesses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feeling. A blush is no
language: only a dubious flag-signal which may mean either of two
contradictories. Deronda alone had a faint guess at some part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
feeling; but while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was himself under
observation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you take off your hat to horses?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, with a slight
sneer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, covering himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had really taken off the
hat automatically, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been an ugly man might doubtless have
done so with impunity; ugliness having naturally the air of involuntary
exposure, and beauty, of display.

<p/>Gwendolen's confusion was soon merged in the survey of the horses,
which Grandcourt politely abstained from appraising, languidly
assenting to Sir Hugo's alternate depreciation and eulogy of the same
animal, as one that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) should not have bought when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was younger, and
piqued himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) horses, but yet one that had better qualities
than many more expensive brutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is, stables dive deeper and deeper into the pocket nowadays,
and I am very glad to have got rid of that _démangeaison_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir
Hugo, as they were coming out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is a man to do, though?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must ride. I don't
see what else there is to do. And I don't call it riding to sit astride
a set of brutes with every deformity under the sun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>This delicate diplomatic way of characterizing Sir Hugo's stud did not
require direct notice; and the baronet, feeling that the conversation
had worn rather thin, said to the party generally, <div class="bookquote">``Now we are going to
see the cloister--the finest bit of all--in perfect preservation; the
monks might have been walking there yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/>But Gwendolen had lingered behind to look at the kenneled blood-hounds,
perhaps because she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt a little dispirited; and Grandcourt waited for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better take my arm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) low tone of command; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) took it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a great bore being dragged about in this way, and no cigar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you would like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like it!--one eternal chatter. And encouraging those ugly
girls--inviting one to meet such monsters. How that _fat_ Deronda can
bear looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you call him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) _fat_? Do you object to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) so much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Object? no. What do I care about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) being a _fat_? It's of no
consequence to me. I'll invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to Diplow again if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is too clever and learned to care
about _us_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, thinking it useful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband to be
told -LRB-privately-RRB- that it was possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to be looked down upon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw that make much difference in a man. Either he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a
gentleman, or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt.

<p/>That a new husband and wife should snatch, a moment's _tete-à-tete_ was
what could be understood and indulged; and the rest of the party left
them in the rear till, re-entering the garden, they all paused in that
cloistered court where, among the falling rose-petals thirteen years
before, we saw a boy becoming acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) first sorrow. This
cloister was built of a harder stone than the church, and had been in
greater safety from the wearing weather. It was a rare example of a
northern cloister with arched and pillard openings not intended for
glazing, and the delicately-wrought foliage of the capitals seemed
still to carry the very touches of the chisel. Gwendolen had dropped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's arm and joined the other ladies, to whom Deronda was
noticing the delicate sense which had combined freedom with accuracy in
the imitation of natural forms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether one oftener learns to love real objects through their
representations, or the representations through the real objects,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
said, after pointing out a lovely capital made by the curled leaves of
greens, showing their reticulated under-side with the firm gradual
swell of its central rib. <div class="bookquote">``When I was a little fellow these capitals
taught me to observe and delight in the structure of leaves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you can see every line of them with your eyes shut,''  (<font color='red'><b>Juliet Fenn/Miss Juliet Fenn/Miss Fenn</b></font>)</div>said
Juliet Fenn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I was always repeating them, because for a good many years this
court stood for me as my only image of a convent, and whenever I read
of monks and monasteries, this was my scenery for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must love this place very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Juliet Fenn/Miss Juliet Fenn/Miss Fenn</b></font>)</div>said Miss Fenn, innocently, not
thinking of inheritance. <div class="bookquote">``So many homes are like twenty others. But
this is unique, and you seem to know every cranny of it. I dare say you
could never love another home so well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I carry it with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, quietly, being used to all
possible thoughts of this kind. <div class="bookquote">``To most men their early home is no
more than a memory of their early years, and I'm not sure but they have
the best of it. The image is never marred. There's no disappointment in
memory, and one's exaggerations are always on the good side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen felt sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) spoke in that way out of delicacy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
and Grandcourt--because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knew they must hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>); and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
probably thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as a selfish creature who only cared about
possessing things in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own person. But whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) might say, it must
have been a secret hardship to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) that any circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) birth
had shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) out from the inheritance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) father's position; and if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) exulted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's taking it, what could he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
feel for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) but scornful pity? Indeed it seemed clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
was avoiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and preferred talking to others--which nevertheless
was not kind in him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/>With these thoughts in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was prevented by a mixture of pride
and timidity from addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) again, and when they were looking at
the rows of quaint portraits in the gallery above the cloisters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
kept up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) air of interest and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) vivacious remarks without any
direct appeal to Deronda. But at the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was very weary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
assumed spirits, and Grandcourt turned into the billiard-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went
to the pretty boudoir which had been assigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and shut herself
up to look melancholy at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ease. No chemical process shows a more
wonderful activity than the transforming influence of the thoughts we
imagine to be going on in another. Changes in theory, religion,
admirations, may begin with a suspicion of dissent or disapproval, even
when the grounds of disapproval are but matter of searching conjecture.

<p/>Poor Gwendolen was conscious of an uneasy, transforming process--all
the old nature shaken to its depths, its hopes spoiled, its pleasures
perturbed, but still showing wholeness and strength in the will to
reassert itself. After every new shock of humiliation she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tried to
adjust herself and seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) old supports--proud concealment, trust in
new excitements that would make life go by without much thinking; trust
in some deed of reparation to nullify her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) self-blame and shield her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
from a vague, ever-visiting dread of some horrible calamity; trust in
the hardening effect of use and wont that would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) indifferent to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) miseries.

<p/>Yes--miseries. This beautiful, healthy young creature, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
two-and-twenty years and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gratified ambition, no longer felt
inclined to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fortunate image in the glass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked at it
with wonder that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could be so miserable. One belief which had
accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) unmarried life as a self-cajoling
superstition, encouraged by the subordination of every one about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--the belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own power of dominating--was utterly gone.
Already, in seven short weeks, which seemed half her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband
had gained a mastery which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could no more resist than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could have
resisted the benumbing effect from the touch of a torpedo. Gwendolen's
will had seemed imperious in its small girlish sway; but it was the
will of a creature with a large discourse of imaginative fears: a
shadow would have been enough to relax its hold. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had found a
will like that of a crab or a boa-constrictor, which goes on pinching
or crushing without alarm at thunder. Not that Grandcourt was without
calculation of the intangible effects which were the chief means of
mastery; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had a surprising acuteness in detecting that
situation of feeling in Gwendolen which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) proud and rebellious
spirit dumb and helpless before him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had burned Lydia Glasher's letter with an instantaneous terror lest
other eyes should see it, and had tenaciously concealed from Grandcourt
that there was any other cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) violent hysterics than the
excitement and fatigue of the day: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been urged into an implied
falsehood. <div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me--it was my feeling about everything--it was
the sudden change from home.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The words of that letter kept repeating
themselves, and hung on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consciousness with the weight of a
prophetic doom. <div class="bookquote">``I am the grave in which your chance of happiness is
buried as well as mine. You had your warning. You have chosen to injure
me and my children. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) had meant to marry me. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) would have married me
at last, if you had not broken your word. You will have your
punishment. I desire it with all my soul. Will you give him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) this letter
to set him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) against me and ruin us more--me and my children? Shall you
like to stand before your husband with these diamonds on you, and these
words of mine in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thoughts and yours? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) think you have any
right to complain when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has made you miserable? You took him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with
your eyes open. The willing wrong you have done me will be your curse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The words had nestled their venomous life within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and stirred
continually the vision of the scene at the Whispering Stones. That
scene was now like an accusing apparition: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dreaded that Grandcourt
should know of it--so far out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sight now was that possibility she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had once satisfied herself with, of speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) about Mrs. Glasher
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) children, and making them rich amends. Any endurance seemed
easier than the mortal humiliation of confessing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) knew all
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and in marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) word. For
the reasons by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) had justified herself when the marriage
tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>), and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) easy arrangement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) future power over her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
husband to make him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) do better than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might be inclined to do, were now
as futile as the burned-out lights which set off a child's pageant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
sense of being blameworthy was exaggerated by a dread both definite and
vague. The definite dread was lest the veil of secrecy should fall
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) and Grandcourt, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) the right to taunt her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>). With
the reading of that letter had begun her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) husband's empire of fear.

<p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) husband all the while knew it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not, indeed, any distinct
knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) broken promise, and would not have rated highly the
effect of that breach on her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) conscience; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was aware not only of
what Lush had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) about the meeting at the Whispering Stones, but
also of Gwendolen's concealment as to the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sudden illness.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) felt sure that Lydia had enclosed something with the diamonds, and
that this something, whatever it was, had at once created in Gwendolen
a new repulsion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) and a reason for not daring to manifest it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>)
did not greatly mind, or feel as many men might have felt, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>)
hopes in marriage were blighted: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) had wanted to marry Gwendolen, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) was not a man to repent. Why should a gentleman whose other
relations in life are carried on without the luxury of sympathetic
feeling, be supposed to require that kind of condiment in domestic
life? What he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chiefly felt was that a change had come over the
conditions of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mastery, which, far from shaking it, might establish
it the more thoroughly. And it was established. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) judged that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
not married a simpleton unable to perceive the impossibility of escape,
or to see alternative evils: he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had married a girl who had spirit and
pride enough not to make a fool of herself by forfeiting all the
advantages of a position which had attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted
pregnant hints to help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in making up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind properly he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would take
care not to withhold them.

<p/>Gwendolen, indeed, with all that gnawing trouble in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consciousness,
had hardly for a moment dropped the sense that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) part to bear
herself with dignity, and appear what is called happy. In disclosure of
disappointment or sorrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw nothing but a humiliation which would
have been vinegar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wounds. Whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband might have come
at last to be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meant to wear the yoke so as not to be
pitied. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did think of the coming years with presentiment: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was frightened at Grandcourt. The poor thing had passed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
girlish sauciness of superiority over this inert specimen of personal
distinction into an amazed perception of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) former ignorance about the
possible mental attitude of a man toward the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sought in
marriage--of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) present ignorance as to what their life with each
other might turn into. For novelty gives immeasurableness to fear, and
fills the early time of all sad changes with phantoms of the future.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) little coquetries, voluntary or involuntary, had told on Grandcourt
during courtship, and formed a medium of communication between them,
showing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the light of a creature such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could understand and
manage: But marriage had nulified all such interchange, and Grandcourt
had become a blank uncertainty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in everything but this, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
would do just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) willed, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had neither devices at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
command to determine his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) will, nor any rational means of escaping it.

<p/>What had occurred between them and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wearing the diamonds was
typical. One evening, shortly before they came to the Abbey, they were
going to dine at Brackenshaw Castle. Gwendolen had said to herself that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would never wear those diamonds: they had horrible words clinging
and crawling about them, as from some bad dream, whose images lingered
on the perturbed sense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) came down dressed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) white, with only a
streak of gold and a pendant of emeralds, which Grandcourt had given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck, and the little emerald stars in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ears.

<p/>Grandcourt stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) back to the fire and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I altogether as you like?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, speaking rather gaily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
not without enjoyment in this occasion of going to Brackenshaw Castle
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) new dignities upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), as men whose affairs are sadly
involved will enjoy dining out among persons likely to be under a
pleasant mistake about them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt.

<p/>Gwendolen felt suddenly uncomfortable, wondering what was to come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was not unprepared for some struggle about the diamonds; but suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
were going to say, in low, contemptuous tones, <div class="bookquote">``You are not in any way
what I like.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was very bad for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to be secretly hating him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>); but it
would be much worse when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) gave the first sign of hating her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mercy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) exclaimed, the pause lasting till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could bear it no
longer. <div class="bookquote">``How am I to alter myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Put on the diamonds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, looking straight at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) narrow glance.

<p/>Gwendolen paused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turn, afraid of showing any emotion, and
feeling that nevertheless there was some change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes as they met
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was obliged to answer, and said as indifferently as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, please not. I don't think diamonds suit me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What you think has nothing to do with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) _sotto
voce_ imperiousness seeming to have an evening quietude and finish,
like his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) toilet. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you to wear the diamonds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray excuse me; I like these emeralds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, frightened in
spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) preparation. That white hand of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) which was touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
whisker was capable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fancied, of clinging round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck and
threatening to throttle her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), mingling with the
vague foreboding of some retributive calamity which hung about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
life, had reached a superstitious point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oblige me by telling me your reason for not wearing the diamonds when
I desire it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) eyes were still fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own eyes narrowing under them as if to shut out an
entering pain.

<p/>Of what use was the rebellion within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could say nothing that
would not hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) worse than submission. Turning slowing and covering
herself again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dressing-room. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) reached out the
diamonds it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) unwillingness to wear them might
have already raised a suspicion in Grandcourt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had some
knowledge about them which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had not given her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fancied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
eyes showed a delight in torturing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) be defiant? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had nothing to say that would touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)--nothing but what would give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) a more painful grasp on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consciousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) delights in making the dogs and horses quail: that is half his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)
pleasure in calling them his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) opened the
jewel-case with a shivering sensation.

<p/>``It will come to be so with me; and I shall quail. What else is there
for me? I will not say to the world, <div class="bookquote">``Pity me.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was about to ring for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) maid when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heard the door open behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). It was Grandcourt who came in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want some one to fasten them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, coming toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not answer, but simply stood still, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to take out the
ornaments and fasten them as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would. Doubtless he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had been used to
fasten them on some one else. With a bitter sort of sarcasm against
herself, Gwendolen thought, <div class="bookquote">``What a privilege this is, to have robbed
another woman of!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you so cold?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had fastened the
last ear-ring. <div class="bookquote">``Pray put plenty of furs on. I hate to see a woman come
into a room looking frozen. If you are to appear as a bride at all,
appear decently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>This martial speech was not exactly persuasive, but it touched the
quick of Gwendolen's pride and forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to rally. The words of the
bad dream crawled about the diamonds still, but only for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): to others
they were brilliants that suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) perfectly, and Grandcourt inwardly
observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) answered to the rein.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, mamma, quite happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen had said on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) return to
Diplow. <div class="bookquote">``Not at all disappointed in Ryelands. It is a much finer place
than this--larger in every way. But don't you want some more money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you not know that Mr. Grandcourt left me a letter on your
wedding-day? I am to have eight hundred a year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wishes me to keep
Offendene for the present, while you are at Diplow. But if there were
some pretty cottage near the park at Ryelands we might live there
without much expense, and I should have you most of the year, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must leave that to Mr. Grandcourt, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly. It is exceedingly handsome of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) will
pay the rent for Offendene till June. And we can go on very
well--without any man-servant except Crane, just for out-of-doors. Our
good Merry will stay with us and help me to manage everything. It is
natural that Mr. Grandcourt should wish me to live in a good style of
house in your neighborhood, and I cannot decline. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said nothing
about it to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wished me to hear it from you, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen in fact had been very anxious to have some definite knowledge
of what would be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, but at no moment since her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
marriage had she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) been able to overcome the difficulty of mentioning the
subject to Grandcourt. Now, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a sense of obligation
which would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rest without saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``It is very good of
you to provide for mamma. You took a great deal on yourself in marrying
a girl who had nothing but relations belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt was smoking, and only said carelessly, <div class="bookquote">``Of course I was not
going to let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) live like a gamekeeper's mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At least he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is not mean about money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>thought Gwendolen, <div class="bookquote">``and mamma is
the better off for my marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) often pursued the comparison between what might have been, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had not married Grandcourt, and what actually was, trying to persuade
herself that life generally was barren of satisfaction, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had chosen differently she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might now have been looking back with a
regret as bitter as the feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was trying to argue away. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mother's dullness, which used to irritate her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was at present
inclined to explain as the ordinary result of woman's experience. True,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) still saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would <div class="bookquote">``manage differently from mamma;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
management now only meant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) troubles with
spirit, and let none suspect them. By and by she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) promised herself that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should get used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart-sores, and find excitements that would
carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) through life, as a hard gallop carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) through some of
the morning hours. There was gambling: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had heard stories at
Leubronn of fashionable women who gambled in all sorts of ways. It
seemed very flat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) at this distance, but perhaps if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began to
gamble again, the passion might awake. Then there was the pleasure of
producing an effect by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) appearance in society: what did celebrated
beauties do in town when their husbands could afford display? All men
were fascinated by them: they had a perfect equipage and toilet, walked
into public places, and bowed, and made the usual answers, and walked
out again, perhaps they bought china, and practiced accomplishments. If
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could only feel a keen appetite for those pleasures--could only
believe in pleasure as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) used to do! Accomplishments had ceased to
have the exciting quality of promising any pre-eminence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and as
for fascinated gentlemen--adorers who might hover round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with
languishment, and diversify married life with the romantic stir of
mystery, passion, and danger, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) French reading had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
some girlish notion of--they presented themselves to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination
with the fatal circumstance that, instead of fascinating her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in return,
they were clad in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own weariness and disgust. The admiring male,
rashly adjusting the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) features and the turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>)
conversation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) supposed tastes, had always been an absurd object
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and at present seemed rather detestable. Many courses are
actually pursued--follies and sins both convenient and
inconvenient--without pleasure or hope of pleasure; but to solace
ourselves with imagining any course beforehand, there must be some
foretaste of pleasure in the shape of appetite; and Gwendolen's
appetite had sickened. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wander over the possibilities of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
life as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would, an uncertain shadow dogged her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) confidence in
herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) destiny had turned into remorse and dread; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) trusted
neither herself nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) future.

<p/>This hidden helplessness gave fresh force to the hold Deronda had from
the first taken on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind, as one who had an unknown standard by
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) judged her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) some way of looking at things which might
be a new footing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--an inward safeguard against possible events
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dreaded as stored-up retribution? It is one of the secrets in
that change of mental poise which has been fitly named conversion, that
to many among us neither heaven nor earth has any revelation till some
personality touches theirs with a peculiar influence, subduing them
into receptiveness. It had been Gwendolen's habit to think of the
persons around her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as stale books, too familiar to be interesting.
Deronda had lit up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) attention with a sense of novelty: not by words
only, but by imagined facts, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) influence had entered into the current
of that self-suspicion and self-blame which awakens a new consciousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could know everything about me without my telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thoughts, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sat leaning over the end of a couch,
supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand, and looking at herself in a
mirror--not in admiration, but in a sad kind of companionship. <div class="bookquote">``I wish
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knew that I am not so contemptible as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thinks me; that I am in
deep trouble, and want to be something better if I could.''  (<font color='red'><b>this man</b></font>)</div>Without the
aid of sacred ceremony or costume, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feelings had turned this man,
only a few years older than herself, into a priest; a sort of trust
less rare than the fidelity that guards it. Young reverence for one who
is also young is the most coercive of all: there is the same level of
temptation, and the higher motive is believed in as a fuller force--not
suspected to be a mere residue from weary experience.

<p/>But the coercion is often stronger on the one who takes the reverence.
Those who trust us educate us. And perhaps in that ideal consecration
of Gwendolen's, some education was being prepared for Deronda.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rien ne pese tant qu'un secret
Le porter loin est difficile aux dames:
Et je sçais mesme sur ce fait
Bon nombre d'hommes qui sont femmes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--LA FONTAINE.


<p/>Meanwhile Deronda had been fastened and led off by Mr. Vandernoodt, who
wished for a brisker walk, a cigar, and a little gossip. Since we
cannot tell a man his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own secrets, the restraint of being in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
company often breeds a desire to pair off in conversation with some
more ignorant person, and Mr. Vandernoodt presently said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a washed-out piece of cambric Grandcourt is! But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) is a
favorite of yours, I withdraw the remark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vandernoodt/Vandernoodt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought not. One wonders how he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) came to have a great passion again;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) must have had--to marry in this way. Though Lush, his (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) old chum,
hints that he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) married this girl out of obstinacy. By George! it was a
very accountable obstinacy. A man might make up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
without the stimulus of contradiction. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have made himself a
pretty large drain of money, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! not of the other establishment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keeps up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Diplow? Of course. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took that of Sir Hugo. But merely for the year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; not Diplow: Gadsmere. Sir Hugo knows, I'll answer for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) really began to feel some curiosity, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
foresaw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should hear what Mr. Vandernoodt had to tell, without
the condescension of asking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lush would not altogether own to it, of course. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)'s a confident and
go-between of Grandcourt's. But I have it on the best authority. The
fact is, there's another lady with four children at Gadsmere. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has
had the upper hand of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) these ten years and more, and by what I can
understand has it still--left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and used to travel
with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) everywhere. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's dead now; I found a fellow who was
in the same regiment with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and knew this Mrs. Glasher before she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>)
took wing. A fiery dark-eyed woman--a noted beauty at that time--he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) was dead. They say she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) has Grandcourt under her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) thumb
still, and it's a wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) didn't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>), for there's a very fine
boy, and I understand Grandcourt can do absolutely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) pleases with
the estates. Lush told me as much as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What right had he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to marry this girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with disgust.

<p/>Mr. Vandernoodt, adjusting the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vandernoodt</b></font>) cigar, shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Vandernoodt</b></font>) shoulders
and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Vandernoodt</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_She (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)_ can know nothing of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vandernoodt/Vandernoodt</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, emphatically. But that
positive statement was immediately followed by an inward query--<div class="bookquote">``Could
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) have known anything of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's rather a piquant picture,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vandernoodt/Vandernoodt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vandernoodt--``Grandcourt
between two fiery women. For depend upon it this light-haired one has
plenty of devil in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). I formed that opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at Leubronn. It's
a sort of Medea and Creüsa business. Fancy the two meeting! Grandcourt
is a new kind of Jason: I wonder what sort of a part he (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>)'ll make of it.
It's a dog's part at best. I think I hear Ristori now, saying, ``Jasone!
Jasone!<div class="bookquote">'' These fine women generally get hold of a stick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandcourt can bite, I fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) is no stick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; I meant Jason. I can't quite make out Grandcourt. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>)'s a
keen fellow enough--uncommonly well built too. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) comes into all
this property, the estates will bear dividing. This girl, whose friends
had come to beggary, I understand, may think herself lucky to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>).
I don't want to be hard on a man because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets involved in an affair
of that sort. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might make himself more agreeable. I was telling
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a capital story last night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up and walked away in the
middle. I felt inclined to kick him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Do you suppose that is inattention
or insolence, now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a mixture. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) generally observes the forms: but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't listen
much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. Then, after a moment's pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``I
should think there must be some exaggeration or inaccuracy in what you
have heard about this lady at Gadsmere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit, depend upon it; it has all lain snug of late years. People
have forgotten all about it. But there the nest is, and the birds are
in it. And I know Grandcourt goes there. I have good evidence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
goes there. However, that's nobody's business but his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own. The affair
has sunk below the surface.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you could have learned so much about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
rather drily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there are plenty of people who knew all about it; but such stories
get packed away like old letters. They interest me. I like to know the
manners of my time--contemporary gossip, not antediluvian. These
Dryasdust fellows get a reputation by raking up some small scandal
about Semiramis or Nitocris, and then we have a thousand and one poems
written upon it by all the warblers big and little. But I don't care a
straw about the _faux pas_ of the mummies. You do, though. You are one
of the historical men--more interested in a lady when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s got a rag
face and skeleton toes peeping out. Does that flatter your imagination?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had any woes in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) love, one has the satisfaction of
knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s well out of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are thinking of the Medea, I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda then chose to point to some giant oaks worth looking at in
their bareness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) also felt an interest in this piece of contemporary
gossip, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was satisfied that Mr. Vandernoodt had no more to tell
about it.

<p/>Since the early days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vandernoodt</b></font>) tried to construct the hidden story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vandernoodt</b></font>)
own birth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vandernoodt</b></font>) mind had perhaps never been so active in weaving
probabilities about any private affair as it had now begun to be about
Gwendolen's marriage. This unavowed relation of Grandcourt's--could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
have gained some knowledge of it, which caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to shrink from the
match--a shrinking finally overcome by the urgence of poverty? He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could
recall almost every word she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and in certain of these
words he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) seemed to discern that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was conscious of having done some
wrong--inflicted some injury. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own acute experience made him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) alive
to the form of injury which might affect the unavowed children and
their mother. Was Mrs. Grandcourt, under all her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) determined show of
satisfaction, gnawed by a double, a treble-headed grief--self-reproach,
disappointment, jealousy? He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) dwelt especially on all the slight signs
of self-reproach: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was inclined to judge her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) tenderly, to excuse, to
pity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had found a key now by which to interpret her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) more
clearly: what magnifying of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) misery might not a young creature get
into who had wedded her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) fresh hopes to old secrets! He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) saw
clearly enough now why Sir Hugo had never dropped any hint of this
affair to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>); and immediately the image of this Mrs. Glasher became
painfully associated with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) own hidden birth. Gwendolen knowing of
that woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) children, marrying Grandcourt, and showing herself
contented, would have been among the most repulsive of beings to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>);
but Gwendolen tasting the bitterness of remorse for having contributed
to their injury was brought very near to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) fellow-feeling. If it were
so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had got to a common plane of understanding with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) on some
difficulties of life which a woman is rarely able to judge of with any
justice or generosity; for, according to precedent, Gwendolen's view of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) position might easily have been no other than that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's
marriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) entrance on the path of virtue, while Mrs.
Glasher represented his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) forsaken sin. And Deronda had naturally some
resentment on behalf of the Hagars and Ishmaels.

<p/>Undeniably Deronda's growing solicitude about Gwendolen depended
chiefly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) peculiar manner toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>); and I suppose neither man
nor woman would be the better for an utter insensibility to such
appeals. One sign that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had changed its footing was
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dismissed any caution against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) being a coquette setting
snares to involve him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a vulgar flirtation, and determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would not again evade any opportunity of talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had shaken
off Mr. Vandernoodt, and got into a solitary corner in the twilight;
but half an hour was long enough to think of those possibilities in
Gwendolen's position and state of mind; and on forming the
determination not to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was likely to be
at tea with the other ladies in the drawing-room. The conjecture was
true; for Gwendolen, after resolving not to go down again for the next
four hours, began to feel, at the end of one, that in shutting herself
up she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) missed all chances of seeing and hearing, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) visit
would only last two days more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) adjusted herself, put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) little
air of self-possession, and going down, made herself resolutely
agreeable. Only ladies were assembled, and Lady Pentreath was amusing
them with a description of a drawing-room under the Regency, and the
figure that was cut by ladies and gentlemen in 1819, the year she (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) was
presented--when Deronda entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I be acceptable?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I had better go back and
look for the others. I suppose they are in the billiard-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; stay where you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pentreath. <div class="bookquote">``They were all
getting tired of me; let us hear what _you_ have to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is rather an embarrassing appeal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, drawing up a
chair near Lady Mallinger's elbow at the tea-table. <div class="bookquote">``I think I had
better take the opportunity of mentioning our songstress,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) added,
looking at Lady Mallinger--<div class="bookquote">``unless you have done so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the little Jewess!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Lady Mallinger. <div class="bookquote">``No, I have not mentioned
her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>). It never entered my head that any one here wanted singing lessons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All ladies know some one else who wants singing lessons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``I have happened to find an exquisite singer,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--here he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) turned
to Lady Pentreath. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) is living with some ladies who are friends of
mine--the mother and sisters of a man who was my chum at Cambridge. She (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>)
was on the stage at Vienna; but she (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) wants to leave that life, and
maintain herself by teaching.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are swarms of those people, aren't there?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.
<div class="bookquote">``Are her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) lessons to be very cheap or very expensive? Those are the two
baits I know of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is another bait for those who hear her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>)
singing is something quite exceptional, I think. She (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) has had such
first-rate teaching--or rather first-rate instinct with her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>)
teaching--that you might imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) singing all came by nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) leave the stage, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pentreath. <div class="bookquote">``I'm too old
to believe in first-rate people giving up first-rate chances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) voice was too weak. It is a delicious voice for a room. You who
put up with my singing of Schubert would be enchanted with hers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, looking at Mrs. Raymond. <div class="bookquote">``And I imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) would not object
to sing at private parties or concerts. Her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) voice is quite equal to
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am to have her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) in my drawing-room when we go up to town,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Mallinger. <div class="bookquote">``You shall hear her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) then. I have not heard her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>) myself yet;
but I trust Daniel's recommendation. I mean my girls to have lessons of
her (<font color='blue'><b>songstress</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a charitable affair?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pentreath. <div class="bookquote">``I can't bear
charitable music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Mallinger, who was rather helpless in conversation, and felt
herself under an engagement not to tell anything of Mirah's story, had
an embarrassed smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) face, and glanced at Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a charity to those who want to have a good model of feminine
singing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``I think everybody who has ears would benefit
by a little improvement on the ordinary style. If you heard Miss
Lapidoth'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--here he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked at Gwendolen--<div class="bookquote">``perhaps you would revoke your
resolution to give up singing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should rather think my resolution would be confirmed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I don't feel able to follow your advice of enjoying my own
middlingness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``people who do anything finely always
inspirit me to try. I don't mean that they make me believe I can do it
as well. But they make the thing, whatever it may be, seem worthy to be
done. I can bear to think my own music not good for much, but the world
would be more dismal if I thought music itself not good for much.
Excellence encourages one about life generally; it shows the spiritual
wealth of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then, if we can't imitate it, it only makes our own life seem the
tamer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a mood to resent encouragement founded on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own insignificance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on the point of view, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``We should
have a poor life of it if we were reduced for all our pleasure to our
own performances. A little private imitation of what is good is a sort
of private devotion to it, and most of us ought to practice art only in
the light of private study--preparation to understand and enjoy what
the few can do for us. I think Miss Lapidoth is one of the few.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) must be a very happy person, don't you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
with a touch of sarcasm, and a turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck toward Mrs. Raymond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>answered the independent lady; <div class="bookquote">``I must hear more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
before I say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may have been a bitter disappointment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) voice failed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) for the stage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Juliet Fenn/Miss Juliet Fenn/Miss Fenn</b></font>)</div>said Juliet Fenn, sympathetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)'s past her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) best, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div>said the deep voice of Lady
Pentreath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) has not reached it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) is barely
twenty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div>interposed Lady Mallinger, with an amiable wish to
help Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) has very good manners. I'm sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)'s a bigoted
Jewess; I should not like it for anything else, but it doesn't matter
in singing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) voice is too weak for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) to scream much, I'll tell
Lady Clementina to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) on my nine granddaughters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Pentreath; <div class="bookquote">``and I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)'ll convince eight of them that they have not
voice enough to sing anywhere but at church. My notion is, that many of
our girls nowadays want lessons not to sing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had my lessons in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, looking at Deronda.
<div class="bookquote">``You see Lady Pentreath is on my side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was speaking, Sir Hugo entered with some of the other
gentlemen, including Grandcourt, and standing against the group at the
low tea-table said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What imposition is Deronda putting on you, ladies--slipping in among
you by himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wanting to pass off an obscurity on us as better than any celebrity,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pentreath--<div class="bookquote">``a pretty singing Jewess who is to astonish these
young people. You and I, who heard Catalani in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) prime, are not so
easily astonished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Hugo listened with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) good-humored smile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) took a cup of tea
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) wife, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, a Liberal is bound to
think that there have been singers since Catalani's time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are younger than I am. I dare say you are one of the men who
ran after Alcharisi. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) married off and left you all in the lurch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, yes; it's rather too bad when these great singers marry
themselves into silence before they have a crack in their voices. And
the husband is a public robber. I remember Leroux saying, <div class="bookquote">``A man might
as well take down a fine peal of church bells and carry them off to the
steppes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, setting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) cup and turning away, while
Deronda, who had moved from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) place to make room for others, and felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not in request, sat down a little apart. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
became aware that, in the general dispersion of the group, Gwendolen
had extricated herself from the attentions of Mr. Vandernoodt and had
walked to the piano, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stood apparently examining the music
which lay on the desk. Will any one be surprised at Deronda's
concluding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)? Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wanted to make
amends for the unpleasant tone of resistance with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had met his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
recommendation of Mirah, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had noticed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) first impulse
often was to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) afterward wished to retract. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
side and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you relenting about the music and looking for something to play or
sing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not looking for anything, but I _am_ relenting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
speaking in a submissive tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I know the reason?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to hear Miss Lapidoth and have lessons from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>), since
you admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) so much,--that is, of course, when we go to town. I mean
lessons in rejoicing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) excellence and my own deficiency,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, turning on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) a sweet, open smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be really glad for you to see and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
returning the smile in kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) as perfect in every thing else as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) music?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't vouch for that exactly. I have not seen enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>). But I
have seen nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) that I could wish to be different. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) has had
an unhappy life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) troubles began in early childhood, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) has
grown up among very painful surroundings. But I think you will say that
no advantages could have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) more grace and truer refinement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what sort of trouble hers were?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not any very precise knowledge. But I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) was on the
brink of drowning herself in despair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what hindered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, quickly, looking at Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some ray or other came--which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) ought to
live--that it was good to live,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answered, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) is full of
piety, and seems capable of submitting to anything when it takes the
form of duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those people are not to be pitied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``I
have no sympathy with women who are always doing right. I don't believe
in their great sufferings.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fingers moved quickly among the edges
of the music.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``that the consciousness of having done
wrong is something deeper, more bitter. I suppose we faulty creatures
can never feel so much for the irreproachable as for those who are
bruised in the struggle with their own faults. It is a very ancient
story, that of the lost sheep--but it comes up afresh every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a way of speaking--it is not acted upon, it is not real,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``You admire Miss Lapidoth because you think her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
blameless, perfect. And you know you would despise a woman who had done
something you thought very wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would depend entirely upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) own view of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) had done,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would be satisfied if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) were very wretched, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, impetuously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not satisfied--full of sorrow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>). It was not a mere way of
speaking. I did not mean to say that the finer nature is not more
adorable; I meant that those who would be comparatively uninteresting
beforehand may become worthier of sympathy when they do something that
awakens in them a keen remorse. Lives are enlarged in different ways. I
dare say some would never get their eyes opened if it were not for a
violent shock from the consequences of their own actions. And when they
are suffering in that way one must care for them more than for the
comfortably self-satisfied.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda forgot everything but his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) vision
of what Gwendolen's experience had probably been, and urged by
compassion let his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes and voice express as much interest as they
would.

<p/>Gwendolen had slipped on to the music-stool, and looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with
pain in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) long eyes, like a wounded animal asking for help.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you persuading Mrs. Grandcourt to play to us, Dan?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo,
coming up and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) hand on Deronda's shoulder with a gentle,
admonitory pinch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot persuade myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, rising.

<p/>Others had followed Sir Hugo's lead, and there was an end of any
liability to confidences for that day. But the next was New Year's Eve;
and a grand dance, to which the chief tenants were invited, was to be
held in the picture-gallery above the cloister--the sort of
entertainment in which numbers and general movement may create privacy.
When Gwendolen was dressing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) longed, in remembrance of Leubronn, to
put on the old turquoise necklace for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sole ornament; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dared
not offend her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband by appearing in that shabby way on an occasion
when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would demand her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) utmost splendor. Determined to wear the
memorial necklace somehow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wound it thrice round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wrist and made
a bracelet of it--having gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) room to put it on just before the
time of entering the ball-room.

<p/>It was always a beautiful scene, this dance on New Year's Eve, which
had been kept up by the family tradition as nearly in the old fashion
as inexorable change would allow. Red carpet was laid down for the
occasion: hot-house plants and evergreens were arranged in bowers at
the extremities and in every recess of the gallery; and the old
portraits stretching back through generations, even to the
pre-portraying period, made a piquant line of spectators. Some
neighboring gentry, major and minor, were invited; and it was certainly
an occasion when a prospective master and mistress of Abbott's and
King's Topping might see their future glory in an agreeable light, as a
picturesque provincial supremacy with a rent-roll personified by the
most prosperous-looking tenants. Sir Hugo expected Grandcourt to feel
flattered by being asked to the Abbey at a time which included this
festival in honor of the family estate; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) also hoped that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own
hale appearance might impress his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) successor with the probable length of
time that would elapse before the succession came, and with the wisdom
of preferring a good actual sum to a minor property that must be waited
for. All present, down to the least important farmer's daughter, knew
that they were to see <div class="bookquote">``young Grandcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>farmer daughter</b></font>)</div>Sir Hugo's nephew, the
presumptive heir and future baronet, now visiting the Abbey with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
bride after an absence of many years; any coolness between uncle and
nephew having, it is understood, given way to a friendly warmth. The
bride opening the ball with Sir Hugo was necessarily the cynosure of
all eyes; and less than a year before, if some magic mirror could have
shown Gwendolen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) actual position, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have imagined herself
moving in it with a glow of triumphant pleasure, conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands a life full of favorable chances which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cleverness
and spirit would enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to make the best of. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
wondering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could get so little joy out of the exultation to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been suddenly lifted, away from the distasteful petty
empire of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) girlhood with its irksome lack of distinction and
superfluity of sisters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have been glad to be even
unreasonably elated, and to forget everything but the flattery of the
moment; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was like one courting sleep, in whom thoughts insist
like willful tormentors.

<p/>Wondering in this way at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own dullness, and all the while longing
for an excitement that would deaden importunate aches, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was passing
through files of admiring beholders in the country-dance with which it
was traditional to open the ball, and was being generally regarded by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own sex as an enviable woman. It was remarked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) carried
herself with a wonderful air, considering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been nobody in
particular, and without a farthing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fortune. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been a
duke's daughter, or one of the royal princesses, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not have
taken the honors of the evening more as a matter of course. Poor
Gwendolen! It would by-and-by become a sort of skill in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
automatically practiced to hear this last great gambling loss with an
air of perfect self-possession.

<p/>The next couple that passed were also worth looking at. Lady Pentreath
had said, <div class="bookquote">``I shall stand up for one dance, but I shall choose my
partner. Mr. Deronda, you are the youngest man, I mean to dance with
you. Nobody is old enough to make a good pair with me. I must have a
contrast.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div>And the contrast certainly set off the old lady to the
utmost. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) was one of those women who are never handsome till they are
old, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) had had the wisdom to embrace the beauty of age as early
as possible. What might have seemed harshness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) features when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>)
was young, had turned now into a satisfactory strength of form and
expression which defied wrinkles, and was set off by a crown of white
hair; her (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) well-built figure was well covered with black drapery, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>)
ears and neck comfortably caressed with lace, showing none of those
withered spaces which one would think it a pitiable condition of
poverty to expose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) glided along gracefully enough, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) dark eyes
still with a mischievous smile in them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) observed the company. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>)
partner's young richness of tint against the flattened hues and rougher
forms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) aged head had an effect something like that of a fine
flower against a lichenous branch. Perhaps the tenants hardly
appreciated this pair. Lady Pentreath was nothing more than a straight,
active old lady: Mr. Deronda was a familiar figure regarded with
friendliness; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been the heir, it would have been regretted
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face was not as unmistakably English as Sir Hugo's.

<p/>Grandcourt's appearance when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) came up with Lady Mallinger was not
impeached with foreignness: still the satisfaction in it was not
complete. It would have been matter of congratulation if one who had
the luck to inherit two old family estates had had more hair, a fresher
color, and a look of greater animation; but that fine families dwindled
off into females, and estates ran together into the single heirship of
a mealy-complexioned male, was a tendency in things which seemed to be
accounted for by a citation of other instances. It was agreed that Mr.
Grandcourt could never be taken for anything but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was--a born
gentleman; and that, in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) looked like an heir. Perhaps the
person least complacently disposed toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) at that moment was Lady
Mallinger, to whom going in procession up this country-dance with
Grandcourt was a blazonment of herself as the infelicitous wife who had
produced nothing but daughters, little better than no children, poor
dear things, except for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own fondness and for Sir Hugo's wonderful
goodness to them. But such inward discomfort could not prevent the
gentle lady from looking fair and stout to admiration, or her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) full blue
eyes from glancing mildly at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) neighbors. All the mothers and fathers
held it a thousand pities that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not had a fine boy, or even
several--which might have been expected, to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
first married.

<p/>The gallery included only three sides of the quadrangle, the fourth
being shut off as a lobby or corridor: one side was used for dancing,
and the opposite side for the supper-table, while the intermediate part
was less brilliantly lit, and fitted with comfortable seats. Later in
the evening Gwendolen was in one of these seats, and Grandcourt was
standing near her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). They were not talking to each other: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was leaning
backward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) against the wall; and Deronda, happening
to observe this, went up to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had resolved not to dance
any more. Having himself been doing hard duty in this way among the
guests, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had earned the right to sink for a little while
into the background, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had spoken little to Gwendolen since their
conversation at the piano the day before. Grandcourt's presence would
only make it the easier to show that pleasure in talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) even
about trivialities which would be a sign of friendliness; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
fancied that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face looked blank. A smile beamed over it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) coming, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) raised herself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) leaning posture. Grandcourt
had been grumbling at the _ennui_ of staying so long in this stupid
dance, and proposing that they should vanish: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had resisted on the
ground of politeness--not without being a little frightened at the
probability that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was silently, angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) reason
for staying, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had begun to despair of the opportunity for the
sake of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had put the old necklace on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wrist. But now at
last Deronda had come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I shall not dance any more. Are you not glad?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, with
some gayety, <div class="bookquote">``you might have felt obliged humbly to offer yourself as a
partner, and I feel sure you have danced more than you like already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not deny that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``since you have danced as much as
you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But will you take trouble for me in another way, and fetch me a glass
of that fresh water?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>It was but a few steps that Deronda had to go for the water. Gwendolen
was wrapped in the lightest, softest of white woolen burnouses, under
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands were hidden. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had drawn off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
glove, which was finished with a lace ruffle, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
hand to take the glass and lifted it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mouth, the
necklace-bracelet, which in its triple winding adapted itself clumsily
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wrist, was necessarily conspicuous. Grandcourt saw it, and saw
that it was attracting Deronda's notice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that hideous thing you have got on your wrist?''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the
husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, composedly, pointing to the turquoises, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) still held the glass; <div class="bookquote">``it is an old necklace I like to wear. I lost
it once, and someone found it for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gave the glass again to Deronda, who immediately carried
it away, and on returning said, in order to banish any consciousness
about the necklace--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is worth while for you to go and look out at one of the windows on
that side. You can see the finest possible moonlight on the stone
pillars and carving, and shadows waving across it in the wind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see it. Will you go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, looking up at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cast his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and saying, <div class="bookquote">``No, Deronda will take you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>slowly moved from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) leaning attitude, and walked away.

<p/>Gwendolen's face for a moment showed a fleeting vexation: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resented
this show of indifference toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Deronda felt annoyed, chiefly for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sake; and with a quick sense, that it would relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) most to
behave as if nothing peculiar had occurred, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Will you take my
arm and go, while only servants are there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
understood well her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) action in drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) attention to the necklace:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to infer that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had submitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind to rebuke--her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
speech and manner had from the first fluctuated toward that
submission--and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt no lingering resentment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) evident
confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) interpretation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) appealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as a peculiar
claim.

<p/>When they were walking together, Gwendolen felt as if the annoyance
which had just happened had removed another film of reserve from
between them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had more right than before to be as open as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
wished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not speak, being filled with the sense of silent
confidence, until they were in front of the window looking out on the
moonlit court. A sort of bower had been made round the window, turning
it into a recess. Quitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
burnous, and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brow against the glass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) moved slightly
away, and held the lapels of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) coat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thumbs under the collar
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) manner was: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had a wonderful power of standing perfectly
still, and in that position reminded one sometimes of Dante's _spiriti
magni con occhi tardi e gravi_. -LRB-Doubtless some of these danced in
their youth, doubted of their own vocation, and found their own times
too modern.-RRB- He (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) abstained from remarking on the scene before them,
fearing that any indifferent words might jar on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): already the calm
light and shadow, the ancient steadfast forms, and aloofness enough
from those inward troubles which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) felt sure were agitating her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) judged aright: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have been impatient of polite conversation.
The incidents of the last minute or two had receded behind former
thoughts which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had imagined herself uttering to Deronda, which now
urged themselves to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips. In a subdued voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose I had gambled again, and lost the necklace again, what should
you have thought of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse than I do now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are mistaken about me. You wanted me not to do that--not to
make my gain out of another's loss in that way--and I have done a great
deal worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't imagine temptations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I am able to
understand what you mean. At least I understand self-reproach.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In
spite of preparation he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was almost alarmed at Gwendolen's precipitancy
of confidence toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), in contrast with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) habitual resolute
concealment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What should you do if you were like me--feeling that you were wrong
and miserable, and dreading everything to come?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It seemed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
hurrying to make the utmost use of this opportunity to speak as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
would.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not to be amended by doing one thing only--but many,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, decisively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, hastily, moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brow from the glass and
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked full at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in return, with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought was severity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
felt that it was not a moment in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) must let himself be tender,
and flinch from implying a hard opinion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean there are many thoughts and habits that may help us to bear
inevitable sorrow. Multitudes have to bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brow to the window again, and said impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``You
must tell me then what to think and what to do; else why did you not
let me go on doing as I liked and not minding? If I had gone on
gambling I might have won again, and I might have got not to care for
anything else. You would not let me do that. Why shouldn't I do as I
like, and not mind? Other people do.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Poor Gwendolen's speech expressed
nothing very clearly except her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) irritation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you would ever get not to mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with
deep-toned decision. <div class="bookquote">``If it were true that baseness and cruelty made an
escape from pain, what difference would that make to people who can't
be quite base or cruel? Idiots escape some pain; but you can't be an
idiot. Some may do wrong to another without remorse; but suppose one
does feel remorse? I believe you could never lead an injurious
life--all reckless lives are injurious, pestilential--without feeling
remorse.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda's unconscious fervor had gathered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went on: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
was uttering thoughts which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had used for himself in moments of
painful meditation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then tell me what better I can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, insistently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Many things. Look on other lives besides your own. See what their
troubles are, and how they are borne. Try to care about something in
this vast world besides the gratification of small selfish desires. Try
to care for what is best in thought and action--something that is good
apart from the accidents of your own lot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>For an instant or two Gwendolen was mute. Then, again moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brow
from the glass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that I am selfish and ignorant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fixed look in silence before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answered firmly--<div class="bookquote">``You will
not go on being selfish and ignorant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not turn away her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) glance or let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyelids fall, but a change
came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face--that subtle change in nerve and muscle which will
sometimes give a childlike expression even to the elderly: it is the
subsidence of self-assertion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I lead you back?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, gently, turning and offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) arm again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) took it silently, and in that way they came in sight
of Grandcourt, who was walking slowly near their former place.
Gwendolen went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am ready to go now. Mr. Deronda
will excuse us to Lady Mallinger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``Lord and Lady Pentreath disappeared some
time ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Grandcourt gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) arm in silent compliance, nodding over his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shoulder
to Deronda, and Gwendolen too only half turned to bow and say,
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>The husband and wife left the gallery and paced the corridors
in silence. When the door had closed on them in the boudoir, Grandcourt
threw himself into a chair and said, with undertoned peremptoriness,
<div class="bookquote">``Sit down.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), already in the expectation of something unpleasant,
had thrown off her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) burnous with nervous unconsciousness, and
immediately obeyed. Turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) eyes toward her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) began--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oblige me in future by not showing whims like a mad woman in a play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose there is some understanding between you and Deronda about
that thing you have on your wrist. If you have anything to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>),
say it. But don't carry on a telegraphing which other people are
supposed not to see. It's damnably vulgar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can know all about the necklace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) angry pride
resisting the nightmare of fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to know. Keep to yourself whatever you like.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>Grandcourt
paused between each sentence, and in each his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) speech seemed to become
more preternaturally distinct in its inward tones. <div class="bookquote">``What I care to know
I shall know without your telling me. Only you will please to behave as
becomes my wife. And not make a spectacle of yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you object to my talking to Mr. Deronda?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care two straws about Deronda, or any other conceited
hanger-on. You may talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as much as you like. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is not going to
take my place. You are my wife. And you will either fill your place
properly--to the world and to me--or you will go to the devil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never intended anything but to fill my place properly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, with bitterest mortification in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You put that thing on your wrist, and hid it from me till you wanted
him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to see it. Only fools go into that deaf and dumb talk, and think
they're secret. You will understand that you are not to compromise
yourself. Behave with dignity. That's all I have to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>With that last word Grandcourt rose, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) back to the fire and
looked down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was mute. There was no reproach that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dared
to fling back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) in return for these insulting admonitions, and the
very reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt them to be insulting was that their purport went
with the most absolute dictate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pride. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would least like
to incur was the making a fool of herself and being compromised. It was
futile and irrelevant to try and explain that Deronda too had only been
a monitor--the strongest of all monitors. Grandcourt was contemptuous,
not jealous; contemptuously certain of all the subjection he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cared for.
Why could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) not rebel and defy him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) longed to do it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
might as well have tried to defy the texture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nerves and the
palpitation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband had a ghostly army at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back,
that could close round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might turn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
splendid attire, like a white image of helplessness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seemed to
gratify himself with looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not even make a
passionate exclamation, or throw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arms, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have done in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) maiden days. The sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) scorn kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I ring?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, after what seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) a long while. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head in assent, and after ringing he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
dressing-room.

<p/>Certain words were gnawing within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The wrong you have done me will
be your own curse.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) closed the door, the bitter tears rose, and
the gnawing words provoked an answer: <div class="bookquote">``Why did you put your fangs into
me and not into him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was uttered in a whisper, as the tears came up
silently. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) immediately pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) handkerchief against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
eyes, and checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tendency to sob.

<p/>The next day, recovered from the shuddering fit of this evening scene,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) determined to use the charter which Grandcourt had scornfully given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and to talk as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) liked with Deronda; but no
opportunities occurred, and any little devices she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could imagine for
creating them were rejected by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pride, which was now doubly active.
Not toward Deronda himself--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was singularly free from alarm lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
should think her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) openness wanting in dignity: it was part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) power
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) free from all misunderstanding as to the
way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) appealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>); or rather, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should
misunderstand her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind. But the last morning
came, and still she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never been able to take up the dropped thread
of their talk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was without devices. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and Grandcourt were to
leave at three o'clock. It was too irritating that after a walk in the
grounds had been planned in Deronda's hearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) did not present
himself to join in it. Grandcourt was gone with Sir Hugo to King's
Topping, to see the old manor-house; others of the gentlemen were
shooting; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was condemned to go and see the decoy and the waterfowl,
and everything else that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) least wanted to see, with the ladies, with
old Lord Pentreath and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) anecdotes, with Mr. Vandernoodt and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>)
admiring manners. The irritation became too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); without
premeditation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) took advantage of the winding road to linger a
little out of sight, and then set off back to the house, almost running
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was safe from observation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) entered by a side door, and the
library was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) left hand; Deronda, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew, was often there; why
might she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) not turn in there as well as into any other room in the
house? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been taken there expressly to see the illuminated family
tree, and other remarkable things--what more natural than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
should like to look in again? The thing most to be feared was that the
room would be empty of Deronda, for the door was ajar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pushed it
gently, and looked round it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was there, writing busily at a distant
table, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) back toward the door -LRB-in fact, Sir Hugo had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
to answer some constituents' letters which had become pressing-RRB-. An
enormous log fire, with the scent of Russia from the books, made the
great room as warmly odorous as a private chapel in which the censors
have been swinging. It seemed too daring to go in--too rude to speak
and interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>); yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went in on the noiseless carpet, and stood
still for two or three minutes, till Deronda, having finished a letter,
pushed it aside for signature, and threw himself back to consider
whether there were anything else for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to do, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could
walk out for the chance of meeting the party which included Gwendolen,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) voice saying, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Deronda.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was certainly startling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rose hastily, turned round, and pushed
away his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) chair with a strong expression of surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I wrong to come in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were far on your walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I turned back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you intend to go out again? I could join you now, if you would
allow me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I want to say something, and I can't stay long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
speaking quickly in a subdued tone, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) walked forward and rested
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arms and muff on the back of the chair he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had pushed away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you that it is really so--I can't help feeling remorse
for having injured others. That was what I meant when I said that I had
done worse than gamble again and pawn the necklace again--something
more injurious, as you called it. And I can't alter it. I am punished,
but I can't alter it. You said I could do many things. Tell me again.
What should you do--what should you feel if you were in my place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The hurried directness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoke--the absence of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
little airs, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were only concerned to use the time in getting
an answer that would guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) appeal unspeakably touching.

<p/>Deronda said,--<div class="bookquote">``I should feel something of what you feel--deep sorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what would you try to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with urgent quickness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Order my life so as to make any possible amends, and keep away from
doing any sort of injury again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sense that
the time for speech was brief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can't--I can't; I must go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a passionate
loud whisper. <div class="bookquote">``I have thrust out others--I have made my gain out of
their loss--tried to make it--tried. And I must go on. I can't alter
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was impossible to answer this instantaneously. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) words had
confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) conjecture, and the situation of all concerned rose in
swift images before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) feeling for those who had been thrust out
sanctioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) remorse; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not try to nullify it, yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) heart
was full of pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answered--taking
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) last words--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the bitterest of all--to wear the yoke of our own wrong-doing.
But if you submitted to that as men submit to maiming or life-long
incurable disease?--and made the unalterable wrong a reason for more
effort toward a good, that may do something to counterbalance the evil?
One who has committed irremediable errors may be scourged by that
consciousness into a higher course than is common. There are many
examples. Feeling what it is to have spoiled one life may well make us
long to save other lives from being spoiled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have not wronged any one, or spoiled their lives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, hastily. <div class="bookquote">``It is only others who have wronged _you_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda colored slightly, but said immediately--<div class="bookquote">``I suppose our keen
feeling for ourselves might end in giving us a keen feeling for others,
if, when we are suffering acutely, we were to consider that others go
through the same sharp experience. That is a sort of remorse before
commission. Can't you understand that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I do--now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``But you were right--I _am_
selfish. I have never thought much of any one's feelings, except my
mother's. I have not been fond of people. But what can I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went
on, more quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I must get up in the morning and do what every one
else does. It is all like a dance set beforehand. I seem to see all
that can be--and I am tired and sick of it. And the world is all
confusion to me'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) made a gesture of disgust. <div class="bookquote">``You say I am
ignorant. But what is the good of trying to know more, unless life were
worth more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda promptly, with a touch of indignant severity,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was inclined to encourage as his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own safeguard; <div class="bookquote">``life _would_
be worth more to you: some real knowledge would give you an interest in
the world beyond the small drama of personal desires. It is the curse
of your life--forgive me--of so many lives, that all passion is spent
in that narrow round, for want of ideas and sympathies to make a larger
home for it. Is there any single occupation of mind that you care about
with passionate delight or even independent interest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda paused, but Gwendolen, looking startled and thrilled as by an
electric shock, said nothing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went on more insistently--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I take what you said of music for a small example--it answers for all
larger things--you will not cultivate it for the sake of a private joy
in it. What sort of earth or heaven would hold any spiritual wealth in
it for souls pauperized by inaction? If one firmament has no stimulus
for our attention and awe, I don't see how four would have it. We
should stamp every possible world with the flatness of our own
inanity--which is necessarily impious, without faith or fellowship. The
refuge you are needing from personal trouble is the higher, the
religious life, which holds an enthusiasm for something more than our
own appetites and vanities. The few may find themselves in it simply by
an elevation of feeling; but for us who have to struggle for our
wisdom, the higher life must be a region in which the affections are
clad with knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The half-indignant remonstrance that vibrated in Deronda's voice came,
as often happens, from the habit of inward argument with himself rather
than from severity toward Gwendolen: but it had a more beneficial
effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) than any soothings. Nothing is feebler than the indolent
rebellion of complaint; and to be roused into self-judgment is
comparative activity. For the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt like a shaken
child--shaken out of its wailing into awe, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said humbly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try. I will think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They both stood silent for a minute, as if some third presence had
arrested them,--for Deronda, too, was under that sense of pressure
which is apt to come when our own winged words seem to be hovering
around us,--till Gwendolen began again--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said affection was the best thing, and I have hardly any--none
about me. If I could, I would have mamma; but that is impossible.
Things have changed to me so--in such a short time. What I used not to
like I long for now. I think I am almost getting fond of the old things
now they are gone.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lip trembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take the present suffering as a painful letting in of light,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, more gently. <div class="bookquote">``You are conscious of more beyond the round of
your own inclinations--you know more of the way in which your life
presses on others, and their life on yours. I don't think you could
have escaped the painful process in some form or other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is a very cruel form,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, beating her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) foot on the
ground with returning agitation. <div class="bookquote">``I am frightened at everything. I am
frightened at myself. When my blood is fired I can do daring
things--take any leap; but that makes me frightened at myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
looking at nothing outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes were directed toward the
window, away from Deronda, who, with quick comprehension said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn your fear into a safeguard. Keep your dread fixed on the idea of
increasing that remorse which is so bitter to you. Fixed meditation may
do a great deal toward defining our longing or dread. We are not always
in a state of strong emotion, and when we are calm we can use our
memories and gradually change the bias of our fear, as we do our
tastes. Take your fear as a safeguard. It is like quickness of hearing.
It may make consequences passionately present to you. Try to take hold
of your sensibility, and use it as if it were a faculty, like vision.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda uttered each sentence more urgently; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) were
seizing a faint chance of rescuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from some indefinite danger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know; I understand what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) loud
whisper, not turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, but lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) small gloved hand and
waving it in deprecation of the notion that it was easy to obey that
advice. <div class="bookquote">``But if feelings rose--there are some feelings--hatred and
anger--how can I be good when they keep rising? And if there came a
moment when I felt stifled and could bear it no longer--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) broke
off, and with agitated lips looked at Deronda, but the expression on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face pierced her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with an entirely new feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was under the
baffling difficulty of discerning, that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been urging on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was thrown into the pallid distance of mere thought before the outburst
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) habitual emotion. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) drowning while his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
limbs were bound. The pained compassion which was spread over his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
features as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with a compunction unlike any
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had felt before, and in a changed and imploring tone she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am grieving you. I am ungrateful. You _can_ help me. I will think of
everything. I will try. Tell me--it will not be a pain to you that I
have dared to speak of my trouble to you? You began it, you know, when
you rebuked me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was a melancholy smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said
that, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) added more entreatingly, <div class="bookquote">``It will not be a pain to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if it does anything to save you from an evil to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, with strong emphasis; <div class="bookquote">``otherwise, it will be a lasting pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--no--it shall not be. It may be--it shall be better with me because
I have known you.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned immediately, and quitted the room.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was on the first landing of the staircase, Sir Hugo passed
across the hall on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) way to the library, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Grandcourt was
not with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/>Deronda, when the baronet entered, was standing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ordinary
attitude, grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) coat-collar, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) back to the table, and
with that indefinable expression by which we judge that a man is still
in the shadow of a scene which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has just gone through. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved,
however, and began to arrange the letters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Mrs. Grandcourt been in here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are the others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) left them somewhere in the grounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>After a moment's silence, in which Sir Hugo looked at a letter without
reading it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``I hope you are not playing with fire, Dan--you
understand me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe I do, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, after a slight hesitation, which
had some repressed anger in it. <div class="bookquote">``But there is nothing answering to your
metaphor--no fire, and therefore no chance of scorching.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Hugo looked searchingly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>), and then said, <div class="bookquote">``So much the better.
For, between ourselves, I fancy there may be some hidden gunpowder in
that establishment.''




 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXVII.

<p/>_Aspern._ Pardon, my lord--I speak for Sigismund.
_Fronsberg._ For him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)? Oh, ay--for him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) I always hold
A pardon safe in bank, sure he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) will draw
Sooner or later on me. What his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) need?
Mad project broken? fine mechanic wings
That would not fly? durance, assault on watch,
Bill for Epernay, not a crust to eat?
_Aspern._ Oh, none of these, my lord; he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) has escaped
From Circe's herd, and seeks to win the love
Of your fair ward Cecilia: but would win
First your consent. You frown.
_Fronsberg._ Distinguish words.
I said I held a pardon, not consent.


<p/>In spite of Deronda's reasons for wishing to be in town again--reasons
in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) anxiety for Mirah was blent with curiosity to know more of
the enigmatic Mordecai--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) did not manage to go up before Sir Hugo, who
preceded his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) family that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) might be ready for the opening of
Parliament on the sixth of February. Deronda took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) quarters in
Park Lane, aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) chambers were sufficiently tenanted by Hans
Meyrick. This was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) expected; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) found other things not
altogether according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) expectations.

<p/>Most of us remember Retzsch's drawing of destiny in the shape of
Mephistopheles playing at chess with man for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul, a game in which
we may imagine the clever adversary making a feint of unintended moves
so as to set the beguiled mortal on carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) defensive pieces away
from the true point of attack. The fiend makes preparation his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) favorite
object of mockery, that he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) may fatally persuade us against our taking
out waterproofs when he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) is well aware the sky is going to clear,
foreseeing that the imbecile will turn this delusion into a prejudice
against waterproofs instead of giving a closer study to the
weather-signs. It is a peculiar test of a man's metal when, after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has painfully adjusted himself to what seems a wise provision, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finds
all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mental precaution a little beside the mark, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excellent
intentions no better than miscalculated dovetails, accurately cut from
a wrong starting-point. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) magnanimity has got itself ready to meet
misbehavior, and finds quite a different call upon it. Something of
this kind happened to Deronda.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) first impression was one of pure pleasure and amusement at finding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sitting-room transformed into an _atelier_ strewed with
miscellaneous drawings and with the contents of two chests from Rome,
the lower half of the windows darkened with baize, and the blonde Hans
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) weird youth as the presiding genius of the littered place--his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
hair longer than of old, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) face more whimsically creased, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
high voice as usual getting higher under the excitement of rapid talk.
The friendship of the two had been kept up warmly since the memorable
Cambridge time, not only by correspondence but by little episodes of
companionship abroad and in England, and the original relation of
confidence on one side and indulgence on the other had been developed
in practice, as is wont to be the case where such spiritual borrowing
and lending has been well begun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you would like to see my casts and antiquities,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans,
after the first hearty greetings and inquiries, <div class="bookquote">``so I didn't scruple to
unlade my chests here. But I've found two rooms at Chelsea not many
hundred yards from my mother and sisters, and I shall soon be ready to
hang out there--when they've scraped the walls and put in some new
lights. That's all I'm waiting for. But you see I don't wait to begin
work: you can't conceive what a great fellow I'm going to be. The seed
of immortality has sprouted within me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a fungoid growth, I dare say--a growing disease in the lungs,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, accustomed to treat Hans in brotherly fashion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
walking toward some drawings propped on the ledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) bookcases;
five rapidly-sketched heads--different aspects of the same face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
stood at a convenient distance from them, without making any remark.
Hans, too, was silent for a minute, took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) palette and began
touching the picture on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) easel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of them?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The full face looks too massive; otherwise the likenesses are good,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, more coldly than was usual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it is not too massive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, decisively. <div class="bookquote">``I have noted that.
There is always a little surprise when one passes from the profile to
the full face. But I shall enlarge her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) scale for Berenice. I am making
a Berenice series--look at the sketches along there--and now I think of
it, you are just the model I want for the Agrippa.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>Hans, still with
pencil and palette in hand, had moved to Deronda's side while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said
this, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) added hastily, as if conscious of a mistake, <div class="bookquote">``No, no, I
forgot; you don't like sitting for your portrait, confound you!
However, I've picked up a capital Titus. There are to be five in the
series. The first is Berenice clasping the knees of Gessius Florus and
beseeching him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) people; I've got that on the easel. Then,
this, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) is standing on the Xystus with Agrippa, entreating the
people not to injure themselves by resistance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Agrippa's legs will never do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The legs are good realistically,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) face creasing drolly;
<div class="bookquote">``public men are often shaky about the legs--' Their legs, the emblem of
their various thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>as somebody says in the `Rehearsal.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But these are as impossible as the legs of Raphael's Alcibiades,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then they are good ideally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans. <div class="bookquote">``Agrippa's legs were possibly
bad; I idealize that and make them impossibly bad. Art, my Eugenius,
must intensify. But never mind the legs now: the third sketch in the
series is Berenice exulting in the prospects of being Empress of Rome,
when the news has come that Vespasian is declared Emperor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) lover
Titus his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) successor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must put a scroll in her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) mouth, else people will not understand
that. You can't tell that in a picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will make them feel their ignorance then--an excellent æsthetic
effect. The fourth is, Titus sending Berenice away from Rome after she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>)
has shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) palace for ten years--both reluctant, both sad--_invitus
invitam_, as Suetonius hath it. I've found a model for the Roman brute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you make Berenice look fifty? She (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) must have been that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; a few mature touches to show the lapse of time. Dark-eyed
beauty wears well, hers particularly. But now, here is the fifth:
Berenice seated lonely on the ruins of Jerusalem. That is pure
imagination. That is what ought to have been--perhaps was. Now, see how
I tell a pathetic negative. Nobody knows what became of her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>)--that is
finely indicated by the series coming to a close. There is no sixth
picture.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>Here Hans pretended to speak with a gasping sense of
sublimity, and drew back his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) head with a frown, as if looking for a
like impression on Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``I break off in the Homeric style. The
story is chipped off, so to speak, and passes with a ragged edge into
nothing--_le néant_; can anything be more sublime, especially in
French? The vulgar would desire to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) corpse and burial--perhaps
her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) will read and her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) linen distributed. But now come and look at this
on the easel. I have made some way there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That beseeching attitude is really good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, after a
moment's contemplation. <div class="bookquote">``You have been very industrious in the
Christmas holidays; for I suppose you have taken up the subject since
you came to London.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>Neither of them had yet mentioned Mirah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, putting touches to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) picture, <div class="bookquote">``I made up my mind to
the subject before. I take that lucky chance for an augury that I am
going to burst on the world as a great painter. I saw a splendid woman
in the Trastevere--the grandest women there are half Jewesses--and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
set me hunting for a fine situation of a Jewess at Rome. Like other men
of vast learning, I ended by taking what lay on the surface. I'll show
you a sketch of the Trasteverina's head when I can lay my hands on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be a more suitable model for Berenice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, not knowing exactly how to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) discontent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it. The model ought to be the most beautiful Jewess in
the world, and I have found her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you made yourself sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) would like to figure in that
character? I should think no woman would be more abhorrent to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Does
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quite know what you are doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. I got her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to throw herself precisely into this attitude.
Little mother sat for Gessius Florus, and Mirah clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knees.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>Here Hans went a little way off and looked at the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) touches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knows nothing about Berenice's history,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
feeling more indignation than he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would have been able to justify.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does--ladies' edition. Berenice was a fervid patriot, but
was beguiled by love and ambition into attaching herself to the
arch-enemy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) people. Whence the Nemesis. Mirah takes it as a
tragic parable, and cries to think what the penitent Berenice suffered
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) wandered back to Jerusalem and sat desolate amidst desolation.
That was her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) own phrase. I couldn't find it in my heart to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) I
invented that part of the story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Show me your Trasteverina,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, chiefly in order to hinder
himself from saying something else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you mind turning over that folio?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans. <div class="bookquote">``My studies of
heads are all there. But they are in confusion. You will perhaps find
her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) next to a crop-eared undergraduate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>After Deronda had been turning over the drawings a minute or two, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These seem to be all Cambridge heads and bits of country. Perhaps I
had better begin at the other end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you'll find her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) about the middle. I emptied one folio into
another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this one of your undergraduates?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, holding up a
drawing. <div class="bookquote">``It's an unusually agreeable face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That! Oh, that's a man named Gascoigne--Rex Gascoigne. An uncommonly
good fellow; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) upper lip, too, is good. I coached him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) got
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) scholarship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) ought to have taken honors last Easter. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) was
ill, and has had to stay up another year. I must look him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) up. I want to
know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)'s going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) is, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, holding up a sketch of the
Trasteverina.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, looking at it rather contemptuously, <div class="bookquote">``too coarse. I
was unregenerate then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda was silent while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) closed the folio, leaving the Trasteverina
outside. Then clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) coat-collar, and turning toward Hans, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``I dare say my scruples are excessive, Meyrick, but I must ask
you to oblige me by giving up this notion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Hans threw himself into a tragic attitude, and screamed, <div class="bookquote">``What! my
series--my immortal Berenice series? Think of what you are saying,
man--destroying, as Milton says, not a life but an immortality. Wait
before you, answer, that I may deposit the implements of my art and be
ready to uproot my hair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Hans laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) pencil and palette, threw himself backward into
a great chair, and hanging limply over the side, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) long hair
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) face, lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) hooked fingers on each side his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) head, and
looked up with comic terror at Deronda, who was obliged to smile, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paint as many Berenices as you like, but I wish you could feel with
me--perhaps you will, on reflection--that you should choose another
model.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, standing up, and looking serious again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) may get into such a position that her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) face is likely to be
recognized. Mrs. Meyrick and I are anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) should be
known as an admirable singer. It is right, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) wishes it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
should make herself independent. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) has excellent chances. One
good introduction is secured already, and I am going to speak to
Klesmer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) face may come to be very well known, and--well, it is
useless to attempt to explain, unless you feel as I do. I believe that
if Mirah saw the circumstances clearly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) would strongly object to
being exhibited in this way--to allowing herself to be used as a model
for a heroine of this sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>As Hans stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) thumbs in the belt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) blouse, listening to
this speech, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) face showed a growing surprise melting into amusement,
that at last would have its way in an explosive laugh: but seeing that
Deronda looked gravely offended, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) checked himself to say, <div class="bookquote">``Excuse my
laughing, Deronda. You never gave me an advantage over you before. If
it had been about anything but my own pictures, I should have swallowed
every word because you said it. And so you actually believe that I
should get my five pictures hung on the line in a conspicuous position,
and carefully studied by the public? Zounds, man! cider-cup and conceit
never gave me half such a beautiful dream. My pictures are likely to
remain as private as the utmost hypersensitiveness could desire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Hans turned to paint again as a way of filling up awkward pauses.
Deronda stood perfectly still, recognizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mistake as to publicity,
but also conscious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) repugnance was not much diminished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
the reverse of satisfied either with himself or with Hans; but the
power of being quiet carries a man well through moments of
embarrassment. Hans had a reverence for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) friend which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) feel
a sort of shyness at Deronda's being in the wrong; but it were not in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) nature to give up anything readily, though it were only a whim--or
rather, especially if it were a whim, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) presently went on,
painting the while--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But even supposing I had a public rushing after my pictures as if they
were a railway series including nurses, babies and bonnet-boxes, I
can't see any justice in your objection. Every painter worth
remembering has painted the face he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) admired most, as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) could.
It is a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) soul that goes out into his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) pictures. He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) diffuses
its influence in that way. He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) puts what he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) hates into a caricature. He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>)
puts what he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) adores into some sacred, heroic form. If a man could paint
the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves a thousand times as the Stella Marts to put courage
into the sailors on board a thousand ships, so much the more honor to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Stella</b></font>). Isn't that better than painting a piece of staring immodesty and
calling it by a worshipful name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every objection can be answered if you take broad ground enough, Hans:
no special question of conduct can be properly settled in that way,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with a touch of peremptoriness. <div class="bookquote">``I might admit all your
generalities, and yet be right in saying you ought not to publish
Mirah's face as a model for Berenice. But I give up the question of
publicity. I was unreasonable there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda hesitated a moment.
<div class="bookquote">``Still, even as a private affair, there might be good reasons for your
not indulging yourself too much in painting her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) from the point of view
you mention. You must feel that her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) situation at present is a very
delicate one; and until she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) is in more independence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) should be kept
as carefully as a bit of Venetian glass, for fear of shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) out of
the safe place she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) is lodged in. Are you quite sure of your own
discretion? Excuse me, Hans. My having found her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) binds me to watch over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>). Do you understand me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) face into a good-humored smile.
<div class="bookquote">``You have the very justifiable opinion of me that I am likely to
shatter all the glass in my way, and break my own skull into the
bargain. Quite fair. Since I got into the scrape of being born,
everything I have liked best has been a scrape either for myself or
somebody else. Everything I have taken to heartily has somehow turned
into a scrape. My painting is the last scrape; and I shall be all my
life getting out of it. You think now I shall get into a scrape at
home. No; I am regenerate. You think I must be over head and ears in
love with Mirah. Quite right; so I am. But you think I shall scream and
plunge and spoil everything. There you are mistaken--excusably, but
transcendently mistaken. I have undergone baptism by immersion. Awe
takes care of me. Ask the little mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't reckon a hopeless love among your scrapes, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, whose voice seemed to get deeper as Hans's went higher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to call mine hopeless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, with provoking
coolness, laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) tools, thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) thumbs into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) belt,
and moving away a little, as if to contemplate his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) picture more
deliberately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, you are only preparing misery for yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, decisively. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not marry a Christian, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>). Have you heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--of course you have--heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) speak of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) people and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) religion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That can't last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will see no Jew who is tolerable.
Every male of that race is insupportable,--`insupportably
advancing'--his (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) nose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may rejoin her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family. That is what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) longs for. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother and
brother are probably strict Jews.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll turn proselyte, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wishes it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, with a shrug and a
laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk nonsense, Hans. I thought you professed a serious love for
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, getting heated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I do. You think it desperate, but I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing; I can't tell what has happened. We must be prepared
for surprises. But I can hardly imagine a greater surprise to me than
that there should have seemed to be anything in Mirah's sentiments for
you to found a romantic hope on.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was too
contemptuous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't found my romantic hopes on a woman's sentiments,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans,
perversely inclined to be the merrier when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was addressed with
gravity. <div class="bookquote">``I go to science and philosophy for my romance. Nature
designed Mirah to fall in love with me. The amalgamation of races
demands it--the mitigation of human ugliness demands it--the affinity
of contrasts assures it. I am the utmost contrast to Mirah--a bleached
Christian, who can't sing two notes in tune. Who has a chance against
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see now; it was all _persiflage_. You don't mean a word you say,
Meyrick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand on Meyrick's shoulder, and
speaking in a tone of cordial relief. <div class="bookquote">``I was a wiseacre to answer you
seriously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my honor I do mean it, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, facing round and
laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) left hand on Deronda's shoulder, so that their eyes fronted
each other closely. <div class="bookquote">``I am at the confessional. I meant to tell you as
soon as you came. My mother says you are Mirah's guardian, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
thinks herself responsible to you for every breath that falls on Mirah
in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house. Well, I love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--I worship her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--I won't despair--I mean
to deserve her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, you can't do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have said, I mean to try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't keep your resolve, Hans. You used to resolve what you would
do for your mother and sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a right to reproach me, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I am ungenerous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, not apologetically, however.
<div class="bookquote">``Yet it can't be ungenerous to warn you that you are indulging mad,
Quixotic expectations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who will be hurt but myself, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``I
am not going to say anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unless I felt sure of the answer. I
dare not ask the oracles: I prefer a cheerful caliginosity, as Sir
Thomas Browne might say. I would rather run my chance there and lose,
than be sure of winning anywhere else. And I don't mean to swallow the
poison of despair, though you are disposed to thrust it on me. I am
giving up wine, so let me get a little drunk on hope and vanity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart, if it will do you any good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, loosing
Hans's shoulder, with a little push. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tone kindly, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
words were from the lip only. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) real feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was silenced.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was conscious of that peculiar irritation which will sometimes
befall the man whom others are inclined to trust as a mentor--the
irritation of perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) is supposed to be entirely off the
same plane of desire and temptation as those who confess to him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>). Our
guides, we pretend, must be sinless: as if those were not often the
best teachers who only yesterday got corrected for their mistakes.
Throughout their friendship Deronda had been used to Hans's egotism,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had never before felt intolerant of it: when Hans, habitually
pouring out his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) own feelings and affairs, had never cared for any
detail in return, and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) chanced to know any, and soon forgotten
it. Deronda had been inwardly as well as outwardly indulgent--nay,
satisfied. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had noted with some indignation, all the stronger
because it must not be betrayed, Hans's evident assumption that for any
danger of rivalry or jealousy in relation to Mirah, Deronda was not as
much out of the question as the angel Gabriel. It is one thing to be
resolute in placing one's self out of the question, and another to
endure that others should perform that exclusion for us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had
expected that Hans would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) trouble: what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had not expected was
that the trouble would have a strong element of personal feeling. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was rather ashamed that Hans's hopes caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) uneasiness in spite
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) well-warranted conviction that they would never be fulfilled.
They had raised an image of Mirah changing; and however he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) might
protest that the change would not happen, the protest kept up the
unpleasant image. Altogether poor Hans seemed to be entering into
Deronda's experience in a disproportionate manner--going beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
part of rescued prodigal, and rousing a feeling quite distinct from
compassionate affection.

<p/>When Deronda went to Chelsea he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not made as comfortable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ought
to have been by Mrs. Meyrick's evident release from anxiety about the
beloved but incalculable son. Mirah seemed livelier than before, and
for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) laugh. It was when they were talking of
Hans, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) being naturally the mother's first topic. Mirah wished to know
if Deronda had seen Mr. Hans going through a sort of character piece
without changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) passes from one figure to another as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) were a bit of flame
where you fancied the figures without seeing them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, full of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) subject; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) is so wonderfully quick. I used never to like comic
things on the stage--they were dwelt on too long; but all in one minute
Mr. Hans makes himself a blind bard, and then Rienzi addressing the
Romans, and then an opera-dancer, and then a desponding young
gentleman--I am sorry for them all, and yet I laugh, all in one'' (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>--here
Mirah gave a little laugh that might have entered into a song.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We hardly thought that Mirah could laugh till Hans came,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Meyrick, seeing that Deronda, like herself, was observing the pretty
picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hans seems in great force just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda in a tone of
congratulation. <div class="bookquote">``I don't wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) enlivening you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)'s been just perfect ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) came back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick,
keeping to herself the next clause--<div class="bookquote">``if it will but last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a great happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, <div class="bookquote">``to see the son and brother come
into this dear home. And I hear them all talk about what they did
together when they were little. That seems like heaven, and to have a
mother and brother who talk in that way. I have never had it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, involuntarily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, regretfully. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you had. I wish you had had
every good.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>The last words were uttered with a serious ardor as if
they had been part of a litany, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) eyes were fixed on Deronda,
who with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) elbow on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) chair was contemplating her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) by
the new light of the impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had made on Hans, and the
possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) being attracted by that extraordinary contrast. It
was no more than what had happened on each former visit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>), that
Mirah appeared to enjoy speaking of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) felt very much as a little
girl fresh from school pours forth spontaneously all the long-repressed
chat for which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has found willing ears. For the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
life Mirah was among those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) entirely trusted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) original
visionary impression that Deronda was a divinely-sent messenger hung
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) image still, stirring always anew the disposition to reliance
and openness. It was in this way she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took what might have been the
injurious flattery of admiring attention into which her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) helpless
dependence had been suddenly transformed. Every one around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) watched
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks and words, and the effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was simply that of
having passed from a trifling imprisonment into an exhilarating air
which made speech and action a delight. To her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind it was all a gift
from others' goodness. But that word of Deronda's implying that there
had been some lack in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life which might be compared with anything
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had known in hers, was an entirely new inlet of thought about him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).
After her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) first expression of sorrowful surprise she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Hans said yesterday that you thought so much of others you
hardly wanted anything for yourself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) told us a wonderful story of
Buddha giving himself to the famished tigress to save her (<font color='blue'><b>tigress</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>tigress</b></font>)
little ones from starving. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) said you were like Buddha. That is
what we all imagine of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't imagine that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, who had lately been finding
such suppositions rather exasperating. <div class="bookquote">``Even if it were true that I
thought so much of others, it would not follow that I had no wants for
myself. When Buddha let the tigress eat him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) might have been very
hungry himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps if he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) was starved he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) would not mind so much about being
eaten,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, shyly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't think that, Mab; it takes away the beauty of the action,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if it were true, Mirah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said the rational Amy, having a
half-holiday from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) teaching; <div class="bookquote">``you always take what is beautiful as
if it were true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, gently. <div class="bookquote">``If people have thought what is the
most beautiful and the best thing, it must be true. It is always there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mirah, what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, coming to the rescue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a truth in thought though it may never have been carried out in
action. It lives as an idea. Is that it?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) turned to Mirah, who was
listening with a blind look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lovely eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be that, because you understand me, but I cannot quite
explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, rather abstractedly--still searching for some
expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But _was_ it beautiful for Buddha to let the tiger eat him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy,
changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ground. <div class="bookquote">``It would be a bad pattern.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The world would get full of fat tigers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab.

<p/>Deronda laughed, but defended the myth. <div class="bookquote">``It is like a passionate word,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``the exaggeration is a flash of fervor. It is an extreme image
of what is happening every day-the transmutation of self.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I can say what I mean, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, who had not heard the
intermediate talk. <div class="bookquote">``When the best thing comes into our thoughts, it is
like what my mother has been to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has been just as really with me
as all the other people about me--often more really with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda, inwardly wincing under this illustration, which brought other
possible realities about that mother vividly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), presently
turned the conversation by saying, <div class="bookquote">``But we must not get too far away
from practical matters. I came, for one thing, to tell of an interview
I had yesterday, which I hope Mirah will find to have been useful to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). It was with Klesmer, the great pianist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, with satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">``You think he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) will help
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) is very much occupied, but has promised to fix a time
for receiving and hearing Miss Lapidoth, as we must learn to call
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>--here Deronda smiled at Mirah--<div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) consents to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very grateful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) wants to hear me sing,

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda was struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) plain sense about these matters of
practical concern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will not be at all trying to you, I hope, if Mrs. Meyrick will
kindly go with you to Klesmer's house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, not at all trying. I have been doing that all my life--I mean,
told to do things that others may judge of me. And I have gone through
a bad trial of that sort. I am prepared to bear it, and do some very
small thing. Is Klesmer a severe man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is peculiar, but I have not had experience enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to know
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be what you would call severe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is kind-hearted--kind in action, if not in speech.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been used to be frowned at and not praised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the by, Klesmer frowns a good deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``but there is
often a sort of smile in his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) eyes all the while. Unhappily he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) wears
spectacles, so you must catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) in the right light to see the smile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not be frightened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) were like a roaring
lion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) only wants me to sing. I shall do what I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I feel sure you will not mind being invited to sing in Lady
Mallinger's drawing-room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) intends to ask you next
month, and will invite many ladies to hear you, who are likely to want
lessons from you for their daughters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How fast we are mounting!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, with delight. <div class="bookquote">``You never
thought of getting grand so quickly, Mirah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a little frightened at being called Miss Lapidoth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah,
coloring with a new uneasiness. <div class="bookquote">``Might I be called Cohen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, promptly. <div class="bookquote">``But I assure you, you must
not be called Cohen. The name is inadmissible for a singer. This is one
of the trifles in which we must conform to vulgar prejudice. We could
choose some other name, however--such as singers ordinarily choose--an
Italian or Spanish name, which would suit your _physique_.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>To Deronda
just now the name Cohen was equivalent to the ugliest of yellow badges.

<p/>Mirah reflected a little, anxiously, then said, <div class="bookquote">``No. If Cohen will not
do, I will keep the name I have been called by. I will not hide myself.
I have friends to protect me. And now--if my father were very miserable
and wanted help--no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) said, looking at Mrs. Meyrick, <div class="bookquote">``I should
think, then, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was perhaps crying as I used to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and had
nobody to pity him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and I had hidden myself from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had none
belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) but me. Others that made friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always left
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep to what you feel right, my dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick. <div class="bookquote">''_I_
would not persuade you to the contrary.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>For her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) own part she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had no
patience or pity for that father, and would have left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) crying.

<p/>Deronda was saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I am rather base to be angry with Hans.
How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) help being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? But it is too absurdly
presumptuous for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) even to frame the idea of appropriating her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and a
sort of blasphemy to suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could possibly give herself to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>What would it be for Daniel Deronda to entertain such thoughts? He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
not one who could quite naively introduce himself where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had just
excluded his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) friend, yet it was undeniable that what had just happened
made a new stage in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) feeling toward Mirah. But apart from other
grounds for self-repression, reasons both definite and vague made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
shut away that question as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might have shut up a half-opened writing
that would have carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagination too far, and given too much
shape to presentiments. Might there not come a disclosure which would
hold the missing determination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) course? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) really know
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) origin? Strangely in these latter months when it seemed right
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should exert his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) will in the choice of a destination, the
passion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) nature had got more and more locked by this uncertainty.
The disclosure might bring its pain, indeed the likelihood seemed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to be all on that side; but if it helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life a
sequence which would take the form of duty--if it saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) from having
to make an arbitrary selection where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt no preponderance of
desire? Still more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wanted to escape standing as a critic outside
the activities of men, stiffened into the ridiculous attitude of
self-assigned superiority. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) chief tether was his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) early inwrought
affection for Sir Hugo, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) gratefully deferential to wishes
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had little agreement: but gratitude had been sometimes
disturbed by doubts which were near reducing it to a fear of being
ungrateful. Many of us complain that half our birthright is sharp duty:
Deronda was more inclined to complain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was robbed of this half;
yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) accused himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would have accused another, of being
weakly self-conscious and wanting in resolve. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was the reverse of
that type painted for us in Faulconbridge and Edmund of Gloster, whose
coarse ambition for personal success is inflamed by a defiance of
accidental disadvantages. To Daniel the words Father and Mother had the
altar-fire in them; and the thought of all closest relations of our
nature held still something of the mystic power which had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) neck
and ears burn in boyhood. The average man may regard this sensibility
on the question of birth as preposterous and hardly credible; but with
the utmost respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knowledge as the rock from which all other
knowledge is hewn, it must be admitted that many well-proved facts are
dark to the average man, even concerning the action of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own heart
and the structure of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own retina. A century ago he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
forefathers had not had the slightest notion of that electric discharge
by means of which they had all wagged their tongues mistakenly; any
more than they were awake to the secluded anguish of exceptional
sensitiveness into which many a carelessly-begotten child of man is
born.

<p/>Perhaps the ferment was all the stronger in Deronda's mind because he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
had never had a confidant to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could open himself on these
delicate subjects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had always been leaned on instead of being
invited to lean. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had longed for the sort of friend to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might possibly unfold his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) experience: a young man like himself who
sustained a private grief and was not too confident about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own
career; speculative enough to understand every moral difficulty, yet
socially susceptible, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) himself was, and having every outward sign
of equality either in bodily or spiritual wrestling;--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had found
it impossible to reciprocate confidences with one who looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had no expectation of meeting the friend he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagined. Deronda's
was not one of those quiveringly-poised natures that lend themselves to
second-sight.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII.

<p/>There be who hold that the deeper tragedy were a Prometheus Bound not
_after_ but _before_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had well got the celestial fire into
the _narthex_ whereby it might be conveyed to mortals: thrust by
the Kratos and Bia of instituted methods into a solitude of despised
ideas, fastened in throbbing helplessness by the fatal pressure of
poverty and disease--a solitude where many pass by, but none regard.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Second-sight''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is a flag over disputed ground. But it is matter of
knowledge that there are persons whose yearnings, conceptions--nay,
traveled conclusions--continually take the form of images which have a
foreshadowing power; the deed they would do starts up before them in
complete shape, making a coercive type; the event they hunger for or
dread rises into vision with a seed-like growth, feeding itself fast on
unnumbered impressions. They are not always the less capable of the
argumentative process, nor less sane than the commonplace calculators
of the market: sometimes it may be that their natures have manifold
openings, like the hundred-gated Thebes, where there may naturally be a
greater and more miscellaneous inrush than through a narrow
beadle-watched portal. No doubt there are abject specimens of the
visionary, as there is a minim mammal which you might imprison in the
finger of your glove. That small relative of the elephant has no harm
in him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>); but what great mental or social type is free from specimens
whose insignificance is both ugly and noxious? One is afraid to think
of all that the genus <div class="bookquote">``patriot''  (<font color='red'><b>genus</b></font>)</div>embraces; or of the elbowing there
might be at the day of judgment for those who ranked as authors, and
brought volumes either in their hands or on trucks.

<p/>This apology for inevitable kinship is meant to usher in some facts
about Mordecai, whose figure had bitten itself into Deronda's mind as a
new question which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt an interest in getting answered. But the
interest was no more than a vaguely-expectant suspense: the
consumptive-looking Jew, apparently a fervid student of some kind,
getting his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) crust by a quiet handicraft, like Spinoza, fitted into none
of Deronda's anticipations.

<p/>It was otherwise with the effect of their meeting on Mordecai. For many
winters, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had been conscious of an ebbing physical life, and as
widening spiritual loneliness, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) passionate desire had
concentrated itself in the yearning for some young ear into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
could pour his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind as a testament, some soul kindred enough to accept
the spiritual product of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own brief, painful life, as a mission to
be executed. It was remarkable that the hopefulness which is often the
beneficent illusion of consumptive patients, was in Mordecai wholly
diverted from the prospect of bodily recovery and carried into the
current of this yearning for transmission. The yearning, which had
panted upward from out of over-whelming discouragements, had grown into
a hope--the hope into a confident belief, which, instead of being
checked by the clear conception he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hastening decline, took
rather the intensity of expectant faith in a prophecy which has only
brief space to get fulfilled in.

<p/>Some years had now gone since he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had first begun to measure men with a
keen glance, searching for a possibility which became more and more a
distinct conception. Such distinctness as it had at first was reached
chiefly by a method of contrast: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) wanted to find a man who differed
from himself. Tracing reasons in that self for the rebuffs he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had met
with and the hindrances that beset him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) imagined a man who would
have all the elements necessary for sympathy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), but in an
embodiment unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) must be a Jew, intellectually cultured,
morally fervid--in all this a nature ready to be plenished from
Mordecai's; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) face and frame must be beautiful and strong, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
must have been used to all the refinements of social life, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) voice
must flow with a full and easy current, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) circumstances be free from
sordid need: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) must glorify the possibilities of the Jew, not sit and
wonder as Mordecai did, bearing the stamp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) people amid the sign
of poverty and waning breath. Sensitive to physical characteristics, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
had, both abroad and in England, looked at pictures as well as men, and
in a vacant hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had sometimes lingered in the National Gallery in
search of paintings which might feed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hopefulness with grave and
noble types of the human form, such as might well belong to men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
own race. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) returned in disappointment. The instances are
scattered but thinly over the galleries of Europe, in which the fortune
or selection even of the chief masters has given to art a face at once
young, grand, and beautiful, where, if there is any melancholy, it is
no feeble passivity, but enters into the foreshadowed capability of
heroism.

<p/>Some observant persons may perhaps remember his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) emaciated figure, and
dark eyes deep in their sockets, as he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) stood in front of a picture that
had touched him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) either to new or habitual meditation: he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) commonly wore
a cloth cap with black fur round it, which no painter would have asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) to take off. But spectators would be likely to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) as an
odd-looking Jew who probably got money out of pictures; and Mordecai,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) looked at them, was perfectly aware of the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) made.
Experience had rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) morbidly alive to the effect of a man's
poverty and other physical disadvantages in cheapening his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) ideas,
unless they are those of a Peter the Hermit who has a tocsin for the
rabble. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hermit</b></font>) was too sane and generous to attribute his (<font color='blue'><b>Hermit</b></font>) spiritual
banishment solely to the excusable prejudices of others; certain
incapacities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hermit</b></font>) own had made the sentence of exclusion; and hence
it was that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hermit</b></font>) imagination had constructed another man who would be
something more ample than the second soul bestowed, according to the
notion of the Cabbalists, to help out the insufficient first--who would
be a blooming human life, ready to incorporate all that was worthiest
in an existence whose visible, palpable part was burning itself fast
away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hermit</b></font>) inward need for the conception of this expanded, prolonged
self was reflected as an outward necessity. The thoughts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hermit</b></font>) heart
-LRB-that ancient phrase best shadows the truth-RRB- seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hermit</b></font>) too
precious, too closely interwoven with the growth of things not to have
a further destiny. And as the more beautiful, the stronger, the more
executive self took shape in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hermit</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hermit</b></font>) loved it beforehand with an
affection half identifying, half contemplative and grateful.

<p/>Mordecai's mind wrought so constantly in images, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) coherent
trains of thought often resembled the significant dreams attributed to
sleepers by waking persons in their most inventive moments: nay, they
often resembled genuine dreams in their way of breaking off the passage
from the known to the unknown. Thus, for a long while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) habitually
thought of the Being answering to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) need as one distantly approaching
or turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) back toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), darkly painted against a golden sky.
The reason of the golden sky lay in one of Mordecai's habits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was
keenly alive to some poetic aspects of London; and a favorite resort of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), when strength and leisure allowed, was to some of the bridges,
especially about sunrise or sunset. Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was bending over
watch-wheels and trinkets, or seated in a small upper room looking out
on dingy bricks and dingy cracked windows, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) imagination
spontaneously planted him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) on some spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had a far-stretching
scene; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) thoughts went on in wide spaces; and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
tried to have in reality the influences of a large sky. Leaning on the
parapet of Blackfriar's Bridge, and gazing meditatively, the breadth
and calm of the river, with its long vista half hazy, half luminous,
the grand dim masses of tall forms of buildings which were the signs of
world-commerce, the oncoming of boats and barges from the still
distance into sound and color, entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mood and blent
themselves indistinguishably with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) thinking, as a fine symphony to
which we can hardly be said to listen, makes a medium that bears up our
spiritual wings. Thus it happened that the figure representative of
Mordecai's longing was mentally seen darkened by the excess of light in
the aerial background. But in the inevitable progress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
imagination toward fuller detail, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) ceased to see the figure with its
back toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). It began to advance, and a face became discernible;
the words youth, beauty, refinement, Jewish birth, noble gravity,
turned into hardly individual but typical form and color: gathered from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) memory of faces seen among the Jews of Holland and Bohemia, and
from the paintings which revived that memory. Reverently let it be said
of this mature spiritual need that it was akin to the boy's and girl's
picturing of the future beloved; but the stirrings of such young desire
are feeble compared with the passionate current of an ideal life
straining to embody itself, made intense by resistance to imminent
dissolution. The visionary form became a companion and auditor; keeping
a place not only in the waking imagination, but in those dreams of
lighter slumber of which it is truest to say, <div class="bookquote">``I sleep, but my heart
waketh'' (<font color='red'><b>auditor</b></font>)</div>--when the disturbing trivial story of yesterday is charged with
the impassioned purpose of years.

<p/>Of late the urgency of irremediable time, measured by the gradual
choking of life, had turned Mordecai's trust into an agitated watch for
the fulfillment that must be at hand. Was the bell on the verge of
tolling, the sentence about to be executed? The deliverer's footstep
must be near--the deliverer who was to rescue Mordecai's spiritual
travail from oblivion, and give it an abiding-place in the best
heritage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) people. An insane exaggeration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own value, even
if his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) ideas had been as true and precious as those of Columbus or
Newton, many would have counted this yearning, taking it as the
sublimer part for a man to say, <div class="bookquote">``If not I, then another,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>and to hold
cheap the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own life. But the fuller nature desires to be
an agent, to create, and not merely to look on: strong love hungers to
bless, and not merely to behold blessing. And while there is warmth
enough in the sun to feed an energetic life, there will still be men to
feel, <div class="bookquote">``I am lord of this moment's change, and will charge it with my
soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>men lord</b></font>)</div><p/>But with that mingling of inconsequence which belongs to us all, and
not unhappily, since it saves us from many effects of mistake,
Mordecai's confidence in the friend to come did not suffice to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
passive, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) tried expedients, pathetically humble, such as happened
to be within his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) reach, for communicating something of himself. It was
now two years since he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) abode under Ezra Cohen's roof,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was regarded with much good-will as a compound of workman,
dominie, vessel of charity, inspired idiot, man of piety, and -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
were inquired into-RRB- dangerous heretic. During that time little Jacob
had advanced into knickerbockers, and into that quickness of
apprehension which has been already made manifest in relation to
hardware and exchange. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) had also advanced in attachment to Mordecai,
regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) as an inferior, but liking him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) none the worse, and taking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) helpful cleverness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) might have taken the services of an
enslaved Djinn. As for Mordecai, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had given Jacob his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) first lessons,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) habitual tenderness easily turned into the teacher's
fatherhood. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was fully conscious of the spiritual distance
between the parents and himself, and would never have attempted any
communication to them from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) peculiar world, the boy moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) with
that idealizing affection which merges the qualities of the individual
child in the glory of childhood and the possibilities of a long future.
And this feeling had drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) on, at first without premeditation, and
afterward with conscious purpose, to a sort of outpouring in the ear of
the boy which might have seemed wild enough to any excellent man of
business who overheard it. But none overheard when Jacob went up to
Mordecai's room one day, for example, in which there was little work to
be done, or at an hour when the work was ended, and after a brief
lesson in English reading or in numeration, was induced to remain
standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) teacher's knees, or chose to jump astride them, often
to the patient fatigue of the wasted limbs. The inducement was perhaps
the mending of a toy, or some little mechanical device in which
Mordecai's well-practiced finger-tips had an exceptional skill; and
with the boy thus tethered, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would begin to repeat a Hebrew poem of
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own, into which years before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had poured his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) first youthful
ardors for that conception of a blended past and future which was the
mistress of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) soul, telling Jacob to say the words after him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The boy will get them engraved within him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>thought Mordecai; <div class="bookquote">``it is a
way of printing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>None readier than Jacob at this fascinating game of imitating
unintelligible words; and if no opposing diversion occurred he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) would
sometimes carry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) share in it as long as the teacher's breath
would last out. For Mordecai threw into each repetition the fervor
befitting a sacred occasion. In such instances, Jacob would show no
other distraction than reaching out and surveying the contents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
pockets; or drawing down the skin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) cheeks to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eyes look
awful, and rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) head to complete the effect; or alternately
handling his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) own nose and Mordecai's as if to test the relation of
their masses. Under all this the fervid reciter would not pause,
satisfied if the young organs of speech would submit themselves. But
most commonly a sudden impulse sent Jacob leaping away into some antic
or active amusement, when, instead of following the recitation he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) would
return upon the foregoing words most ready to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) tongue, and mouth or
gabble, with a see-saw suited to the action of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) limbs, a verse on
which Mordecai had spent some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) too scanty heart's blood. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
waited with such patience as a prophet needs, and began his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) strange
printing again undiscouraged on the morrow, saying inwardly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My words may rule him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) some day. Their meaning may flash out on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). It
is so with a nation--after many days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a prophet</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile Jacob's sense of power was increased and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) time enlivened
by a store of magical articulation with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) made the baby crow, or
drove the large cat into a dark corner, or promised himself to frighten
any incidental Christian of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own years. One week he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had
unfortunately seen a street mountebank, and this carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
muscular imitativeness in sad divergence from New Hebrew poetry, after
the model of Jehuda ha-Levi. Mordecai had arrived at a fresh passage in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) poem; for as soon as Jacob had got well used to one portion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was
led on to another, and a fresh combination of sounds generally answered
better in keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) fast for a few minutes. The consumptive voice,
generally a strong high baritone, with its variously mingling
hoarseness, like a haze amidst illuminations, and its occasional
incipient gasp had more than the usual excitement, while it gave forth
Hebrew verses with a meaning something like this:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Away from me the garment of forgetfulness.
Withering the heart;
The oil and wine from presses of the Goyim,
Poisoned with scorn.
Solitude is on the sides of Mount Nebo,
In its heart a tomb:
There the buried ark and golden cherubim
Make hidden light:
There the solemn gaze unchanged,
The wings are spread unbroken:
Shut beneath in silent awful speech
The Law lies graven.
Solitude and darkness are my covering,
And my heart a tomb;
Smite and shatter it, O Gabriel!
Shatter it as the clay of the founder
Around the golden image.''

 (<font color='red'><b>voice a baritone</b></font>)</div><p/>In the absorbing enthusiasm with which Mordecai had intoned rather than
spoken this last invocation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was unconscious that Jacob had ceased
to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) and had started away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) knees; but pausing he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) saw,
as by a sudden flash, that the lad had thrown himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hands with
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) feet in the air, mountebank fashion, and was picking up with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
lips a bright farthing which was a favorite among his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) pocket treasures.
This might have been reckoned among the tricks Mordecai was used to,
but at this moment it jarred him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) horribly, as if it had been a Satanic
grin upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) prayer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Child! child!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) called out with a strange cry that startled Jacob to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) feet, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) sank backward with a shudder, closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, quickly. Then, not getting an immediate answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
pressed Mordecai's knees with a shaking movement, in order to rouse
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>). Mordecai opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) eyes with a fierce expression in them, leaned
forward, grasped the little shoulders, and said in a quick, hoarse
whisper--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A curse is on your generation, child. They will open the mountain and
drag forth the golden wings and coin them into money, and the solemn
faces they will break up into ear-rings for wanton women! And they
shall get themselves a new name, but the angel of ignominy, with the
fiery brand, shall know them, and their heart shall be the tomb of dead
desires that turn their life to rottenness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>The aspect and action of Mordecai were so new and mysterious to
Jacob--they carried such a burden of obscure threat--it was as if the
patient, indulgent companion had turned into something unknown and
terrific: the sunken dark eyes and hoarse accents close to him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>), the
thin grappling fingers, shook Jacob's little frame into awe, and while
Mordecai was speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) stood trembling with a sense that the house
was tumbling in and they were not going to have dinner any more. But
when the terrible speech had ended and the pinch was relaxed, the shock
resolved itself into tears; Jacob lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) small patriarchal
countenance and wept aloud. This sign of childish grief at once
recalled Mordecai to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) usual gentle self: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was not able to speak
again at present, but with a maternal action he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) drew the curly head
toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) and pressed it tenderly against his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) breast. On this Jacob,
feeling the danger well-nigh over, howled at ease, beginning to imitate
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) own performance and improve upon it--a sort of transition from
impulse into art often observable. Indeed, the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) undertook to
terrify Adelaide Rebekah in like manner, and succeeded very well.

<p/>But Mordecai suffered a check which lasted long, from the consciousness
of a misapplied agitation; sane as well as excitable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) judged
severely his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) moments of aberration into futile eagerness, and felt
discredited with himself. All the more his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind was strained toward the
discernment of that friend to come, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) would have a calm
certainty of fellowship and understanding.

<p/>It was just then that, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) usual midday guardianship of the old
book-shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was struck by the appearance of Deronda, and it is
perhaps comprehensible now why Mordecai's glance took on a sudden eager
interest as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) looked at the new-comer: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) saw a face and frame which
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) to realize the long-conceived type. But the disclaimer of
Jewish birth was for the moment a backward thrust of double severity,
the particular disappointment tending to shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) confidence in the
more indefinite expectation. Nevertheless, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) found Deronda seated
at the Cohens' table, the disclaimer was for the moment nullified: the
first impression returned with added force, seeming to be guaranteed by
this second meeting under circumstance more peculiar than the former;
and in asking Deronda if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) knew Hebrew, Mordecai was so possessed by
the new inrush of belief, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had forgotten the absence of any
other condition to the fulfillment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hopes. But the answering <div class="bookquote">``No''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>struck them all down again, and the frustration was more painful than
before. After turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) back on the visitor that Sabbath evening,
Mordecai went through days of a deep discouragement, like that of men
on a doomed ship, who having strained their eyes after a sail, and
beheld it with rejoicing, behold it never advance, and say, <div class="bookquote">``Our sick
eyes make it.''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>But the long-contemplated figure had come as an
emotional sequence of Mordecai's firmest theoretic convictions; it had
been wrought from the imagery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) most passionate life; and it
inevitably reappeared--reappeared in a more specific self-asserting
form than ever. Deronda had that sort of resemblance to the
preconceived type which a finely individual bust or portrait has to the
more generalized copy left in our minds after a long interval: we renew
our memory with delight, but we hardly know with how much correction.
And now, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face met Mordecai's inward gaze as it had always belonged
to the awaited friend, raying out, moreover, some of that influence
which belongs to breathing flesh; till by-and-by it seemed that
discouragement had turned into a new obstinacy of resistance, and the
ever-recurrent vision had the force of an outward call to disregard
counter-evidence, and keep expectation awake. It was Deronda now who
was seen in the often painful night-watches, when we are all liable to
be held with the clutch of a single thought--whose figure, never with
its back turned, was seen in moments of soothed reverie or soothed
dozing, painted on that golden sky which was the doubly blessed symbol
of advancing day and of approaching rest.

<p/>Mordecai knew that the nameless stranger was to come and redeem his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
ring; and, in spite of contrary chances, the wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) again was
growing into a belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). In the January weeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
felt an increasing agitation of that subdued hidden quality which
hinders nervous people from any steady occupation on the eve of an
anticipated change. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) could not go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) printing of Hebrew on
little Jacob's mind; or with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) attendance at a weekly club, which was
another effort of the same forlorn hope: something else was coming. The
one thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) longed for was to get as far as the river, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) could
do but seldom and with difficulty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) yearned with a poet's yearning
for the wide sky, the far-reaching vista of bridges, the tender and
fluctuating lights on the water which seems to breathe with a life that
can shiver and mourn, be comforted and rejoice.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vor den Wissenden sich stellen
Sicher ist's in alien Fällen!
Wenn du lange dich gequälet
Weiss er gleich wo dir es fehlet;
Auch auf Beifall darfst du hoffen,
Denn er weiss wo du's getroffen,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--GOETHE: _West-östlicker Divan_.


<p/>Momentous things happened to Deronda the very evening of that visit to
the small house at Chelsea, when there was the discussion about Mirah's
public name. But for the family group there, what appeared to be the
chief sequence connected with it occurred two days afterward. About
four o'clock wheels paused before the door, and there came one of those
knocks with an accompanying ring which serve to magnify the sense of
social existence in a region where the most enlivening signals are
usually those of the muffin-man. All the girls were at home, and the
two rooms were thrown together to make space for Kate's drawing, as
well as a great length of embroidery which had taken the place of the
satin cushions--a sort of _pièce de résistance_ in the courses of
needlework, taken up by any clever fingers that happened to be at
liberty. It stretched across the front room picturesquely enough, Mrs.
Meyrick bending over it on one corner, Mab in the middle, and Amy at
the other end. Mirah, whose performances in point of sewing were on the
make-shift level of the tailor-bird's, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) education in that branch
having been much neglected, was acting as reader to the party, seated
on a camp-stool; in which position she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) also served Kate as model for a
title-page vignette, symbolizing a fair public absorbed in the
successive volumes of the family tea-table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was giving forth with
charming distinctness the delightful Essay of Elia, <div class="bookquote">``The Praise of
Chimney-Sweeps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elia</b></font>)</div>and all were smiling over the <div class="bookquote">``innocent blackness,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Elia</b></font>)</div>when the imposing knock and ring called their thoughts to loftier
spheres, and they looked up in wonderment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick; <div class="bookquote">``can it be Lady Mallinger? Is there a
grand carriage, Amy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--only a hansom cab. It must be a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Prime Minister, I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate dryly. <div class="bookquote">``Hans says the
greatest man in London may get into a hansom cab.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh, oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>cried Mab. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose it should be Lord Russell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>The five bright faces were all looking amused when the old maid-servant
bringing in a card distractedly left the parlor-door open, and there
was seen bowing toward Mrs. Meyrick a figure quite unlike that of the
respected Premier--tall and physically impressive even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) kid and
kerseymere, with massive face, flamboyant hair, and gold spectacles: in
fact, as Mrs. Meyrick saw from the card, _Julius Klesmer_.

<p/>Even embarrassment could hardly have made the <div class="bookquote">``little mother''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>awkward,
but quick in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) perceptions she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was at once aware of the situation,
and felt well satisfied that the great personage had come to Mirah
instead of requiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Julius</b></font>); taking it as a sign of active
interest. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Julius</b></font>) entered, the rooms shrank into closets, the
cottage piano, Mab thought, seemed a ridiculous toy, and the entire
family existence as petty and private as an establishment of mice in
the Tuileries. Klesmer's personality, especially his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) way of glancing
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>), immediately suggested vast areas and a multitudinous
audience, and probably they made the usual scenery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
consciousness, for we all of us carry on our thinking in some habitual
locus where there is a presence of other souls, and those who take in a
larger sweep than their neighbors are apt to seem mightily vain and
affected. Klesmer was vain, but not more so than many contemporaries of
heavy aspect, whose vanity leaps out and startles one like a spear out
of a walking-stick; as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) carriage and gestures, these were as
natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) as the length of his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) fingers; and the rankest
affectation he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) could have shown would have been to look diffident and
demure. While his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) grandiose air was making Mab feel herself a
ridiculous toy to match the cottage piano, he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) was taking in the details
around him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) with a keen and thoroughly kind sensibility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) remembered a
home no longer than this on the outskirts of Bohemia; and in the
figurative Bohemia too he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had had large acquaintance with the variety
and romance which belong to small incomes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) addressed Mrs. Meyrick
with the utmost deference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I have not taken too great a freedom. Being in the
neighborhood, I ventured to save time by calling. Our friend, Mr.
Deronda, mentioned to me an understanding that I was to have the honor
of becoming acquainted with a young lady here--Miss Lapidoth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Klesmer had really discerned Mirah in the first moment of entering,
but, with subtle politeness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) looked round bowingly at the three
sisters as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) were uncertain which was the young lady in question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those are my daughters: this is Miss Lapidoth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick,
waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hand toward Mirah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, in a tone of gratified expectation, turning a
radiant smile and deep bow to Mirah, who, instead of being in the least
taken by surprise, had a calm pleasure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) liked the look
of Klesmer, feeling sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) would scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), like a great musician
and a kind man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not object to beginning our acquaintance by singing to me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) added, aware that they would all be relieved by getting rid of
preliminaries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very glad. It is good of you to be willing to listen to
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, moving to the piano. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I accompany myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, seating himself, at Mrs. Meyrick's
invitation, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) could have a good view of the singer. The acute
little mother would not have acknowledged the weakness, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) really
said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) will like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) singing better if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>All the feminine hearts except Mirah's were beating fast with anxiety,
thinking Klesmer terrific as he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) listening frown on, and
only daring to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) furtively. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) did say anything severe it
would be so hard for them all. They could only comfort themselves with
thinking that Prince Camaralzaman, who had heard the finest things,
preferred Mirah's singing to any other:--also she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) appeared to be doing
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) very best, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were more instead of less at ease than usual.

<p/>The song she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had chosen was a fine setting of some words selected from
Leopardi's grand Ode to Italy:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_O patria mia, vedo le mura c gli archi
E le colonne e i simula-cri e l'erme
Torridegli avi nostri_'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>This was recitative: then followed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Ma la gloria--non vedo_'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>a mournful melody, a rhythmic plaint. After this came a climax of
devout triumph--passing from the subdued adoration of a happy Andante
in the words--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Beatissimi voi.
Che offriste il petto alle nemiche lance
Per amor di costei che al sol vi diede_'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>to the joyous outburst of an exultant Allegro in--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Oh viva, oh viva:
Beatissimi voi
Mentre nel monde si favelli o scriva._''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatissimi</b></font>) had ended, Klesmer said after a moment--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is Joseph Leo's music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leo</b></font>) was my last master--at Vienna: so fierce and so good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said
Mirah, with a melancholy smile. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Leo</b></font>) prophesied that my voice would not
do for the stage. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Leo</b></font>) was right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Con_tinue, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) lips and
shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) long fingers, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) went on with a smothered
articulation quite unintelligible to the audience.

<p/>The three girls detested him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) unanimously for not saying one word of
praise. Mrs. Meyrick was a little alarmed.

<p/>Mirah, simply bent on doing what Klesmer desired, and imagining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
would now like to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) sing some German, went through Prince
Radzivill's music to Gretchen's songs in the <div class="bookquote">``Faust,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gretchen</b></font>)</div>one after the
other without any interrogatory pause. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretchen</b></font>) had finished he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) rose
and walked to the extremity of the small space at command, then walked
back to the piano, where Mirah had risen from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretchen</b></font>) seat and stood
looking toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretchen</b></font>) little hands crossed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretchen</b></font>), meekly
awaiting judgment; then with a sudden unknitting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) brow and with
beaming eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hand and said abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``Let us
shake hands: you are a musician.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mab felt herself beginning to cry, and all the three girls held Klesmer
adorable. Mrs. Meyrick took a long breath.

<p/>But straightway the frown came again, the long hand, back uppermost,
was stretched out in quite a different sense to touch with finger-tip
the back of Mirah's, and with protruded lip he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for great tasks. No high roofs. We are no skylarks. We must be
modest.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Klesmer paused here. And Mab ceased to think him (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) adorable: <div class="bookquote">``as
if Mirah had shown the least sign of conceit!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah was silent, knowing that there was a specific opinion to be
waited for, and Klesmer presently went on--<div class="bookquote">``I would not advise--I would
not further your singing in any larger space than a private
drawing-room. But you will do there. And here in London that is one of
the best careers open. Lessons will follow. Will you come and sing at a
private concert at my house on Wednesday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I shall be grateful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hands together
devoutly. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather get my bread in that way than by anything
more public. I will try to improve. What should I work at most?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Klesmer made a preliminary answer in noises which sounded like words
bitten in two and swallowed before they were half out, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
fingers the while, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) said, quite distinctly, <div class="bookquote">``I shall introduce
you to Astorga: he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is the foster-father of good singing and will give
you advice.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then addressing Mrs. Meyrick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Klesmer will
call before Wednesday, with your permission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall feel that to be a great kindness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will sing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, turning again to Mirah. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) is a
thorough musician, and has a soul with more ears to it than you will
often get in a musician. Your singing will satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>):--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vor den Wissenden sich stellen;'

<p/>you know the rest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Sicher ist's in alien Fällen.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mirah, promptly. And Klesmer saying <div class="bookquote">``Schön!''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) hand
again as a good-bye.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) had certainly chosen the most delicate way of praising Mirah, and
the Meyrick girls had now given him (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) all their esteem. But imagine Mab's
feeling when suddenly fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) said decisively, <div class="bookquote">``That
young lady is musical, I see!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was a mere blush and sense of
scorching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) behalf. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has a touch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, Mirah--a scramble, not a touch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, in anguish,
with a horrible fear of what the next thing might be: this dreadful
divining personage--evidently Satan in gray trousers--might order her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
to sit down to the piano, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) heart was like molten wax in the
midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>). But this was cheap payment for her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) amazed joy when
Klesmer said benignantly, turning to Mrs. Meyrick, <div class="bookquote">``Will she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) like to
accompany Miss Lapidoth and hear the music on Wednesday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There could hardly be a greater pleasure for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will be most glad and grateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sisters</b></font>)</div><p/>Thereupon Klesmer bowed round to the three sisters more grandly than
they had ever been bowed to before. Altogether it was an amusing
picture--the little room with so much of its diagonal taken up in
Klesmer's magnificent bend to the small feminine figures like images a
little less than life-size, the grave Holbein faces on the walls, as
many as were not otherwise occupied, looking hard at this stranger who
by his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) face seemed a dignified contemporary of their own, but whose
garments seemed a deplorable mockery of the human form.

<p/>Mrs. Meyrick could not help going out of the room with Klesmer and
closing the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), and said with a
frowning nod--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will do: if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doesn't attempt too much and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice holds out,
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can make an income. I know that is the great point: Deronda told
me. You are taking care of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looks like a good girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is an angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the warm-hearted woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>said Klesmer, with a playful nod; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a pretty Jewess: the
angels must not get the credit of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). But I think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has found a
guardian angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) ended, bowing himself out in this amiable way.

<p/>The four young creatures had looked at each other mutely till the door
banged and Mrs. Meyrick re-entered. Then there was an explosion. Mab
clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hands and danced everywhere inconveniently; Mrs. Meyrick
kissed Mirah and blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>); Amy said emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``We can never get
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a new dress before Wednesday!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>and Kate exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Thank heaven my
table is not knocked over!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah had reseated herself on the music-stool without speaking, and the
tears were rolling down her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cheeks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, now, Mab!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick; <div class="bookquote">``come and sit down reasonably and
let us talk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, let us talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, cordially, coming back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) low seat
and caressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) knees. <div class="bookquote">``I am beginning to feel large again. Hans said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was coming this afternoon. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had been here--only there would
have been no room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>). Mirah, what are you looking sad for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am too happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah. <div class="bookquote">``I feel so full of gratitude to you all;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was so very kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, sharply. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) might have said something
encouraging sooner. I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) dreadfully ugly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) sat frowning,
and only said, '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>_Con_tinue.<div class="bookquote">'' I hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) all the long way from the top
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hair to the toe of his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) polished boot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Mab; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) has a splendid profile,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Now_, but not _then_. I cannot bear people to keep their minds
bottled up for the sake of letting them off with a pop. They seem to
grudge making you happy unless they can make you miserable beforehand.
However, I forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Mab, with a magnanimous air,
<div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) has invited me. I wonder why he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) fixed on me as the musical one?
Was it because I have a bulging forehead, ma, and peep from under it
like a newt from under a stone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was your way of listening to the singing, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Meyrick. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) has magic spectacles and sees everything through them,
depend upon it. But what was that German quotation you were so ready
with, Mirah--you learned puss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that was not learning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) tearful face breaking into
an amused smile. <div class="bookquote">``I said it so many times for a lesson. It means that
it is safer to do anything--singing or anything else--before those who
know and understand all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was why you were not one bit frightened, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy.
<div class="bookquote">``But now, what we have to talk about is a dress for you on Wednesday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want anything better than this black merino,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah,
rising to show the effect. <div class="bookquote">``Some white gloves and some new _bottines_.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little foot, clad in the famous felt slipper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There comes Hans,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick. <div class="bookquote">``Stand still, and let us hear
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) says about the dress. Artists are the best people to consult
about such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't consult me, ma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) eyebrow with a
playful complainingness. <div class="bookquote">``I notice mothers are like the people I deal
with--the girls' doings are always priced low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, the boys are such a trouble--we could never put up with
them, if we didn't make believe they were worth more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Meyrick, just as her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) boy entered. <div class="bookquote">``Hans, we want your opinion about
Mirah's dress. A great event has happened. Klesmer has been here, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) is going to sing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) house on Wednesday among grand people. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>)
thinks this dress will do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans. Mirah in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) childlike way turned toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
to be looked at; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>), going to a little further distance, knelt with
one knee on a hassock to survey her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This would be thought a very good stage-dress for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) said,
pleadingly, <div class="bookquote">``in a part where I was to come on as a poor Jewess and sing
to fashionable Christians.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be effective,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, with a considering air; <div class="bookquote">``it would
stand out well among the fashionable _chiffons_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you ought not to claim all the poverty on your side, Mirah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said
Amy. <div class="bookquote">``There are plenty of poor Christians and dreadfully rich Jews and
fashionable Jewesses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean any harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah. <div class="bookquote">``Only I have been used to
thinking about my dress for parts in plays. And I almost always had a
part with a plain dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That makes me think it questionable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, who had suddenly
become as fastidious and conventional on this occasion as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had
thought Deronda was, apropos of the Berenice-pictures. <div class="bookquote">``It looks a
little too theatrical. We must not make you a _rôle_ of the poor
Jewess--or of being a Jewess at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>Hans had a secret desire to
neutralize the Jewess in private life, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was in danger of not
keeping secret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is what I am really. I am not pretending anything. I shall
never be anything else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah. <div class="bookquote">``I always feel myself a Jewess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we can't feel that about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, with a devout look.
<div class="bookquote">``What does it signify whether a perfect woman is a Jewess or not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is your kind way of praising me; I never was praised so before,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, with a smile, which was rather maddening to Hans and made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) feel still more of a cosmopolitan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``People don't think of me as a British Christian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) face
creasing merrily. <div class="bookquote">``They think of me as an imperfectly handsome young
man and an unpromising painter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are wandering from the dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``If that will not do,
how are we to get another before Wednesday? and to-morrow Sunday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed this will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, entreatingly. <div class="bookquote">``It is all real, you
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>here she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked at Hans--<div class="bookquote">``even if it seemed theatrical. Poor
Berenice sitting on the ruins--any one might say that was theatrical,
but I know that this is just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) would do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a scoundrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, overcome by this misplaced trust. <div class="bookquote">``That
is my invention. Nobody knows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) did that. Shall you forgive me
for not saying so before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, after a momentary pause of surprise. <div class="bookquote">``You knew
it was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) would be sure to do--a Jewess who had not been
faithful--who had done what she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) did and was penitent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) could have no
joy but to afflict herself; and where else would she (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) go? I think it is
very beautiful that you should enter so into what a Jewess would feel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Jewesses of that time sat on ruins,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, starting up with a
sense of being checkmated. <div class="bookquote">``That makes them convenient for pictures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the dress--the dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy; <div class="bookquote">``is it settled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; is it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, looking doubtfully at Mrs. Meyrick, who
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) turn looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) son, and said, <div class="bookquote">``What do you think, Hans?''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That dress will not do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, decisively. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) is not going to
sit on ruins. You must jump into a cab with her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>), little mother, and go
to Regent Street. It's plenty of time to get anything you like--a black
silk dress such as ladies wear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) must not be taken for an object of
charity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) has talents to make people indebted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is what Mr. Deronda would like--for her (<font color='blue'><b>Berenice</b></font>) to have a handsome
dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, deliberating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, with some sharpness. <div class="bookquote">``You may take my
word for what a gentleman would feel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to do what Mr. Deronda would like me to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah,
gravely, seeing that Mrs. Meyrick looked toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>); and Hans, turning
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) heel, went to Kate's table and took up one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) drawings as if
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) interest needed a new direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't you like to make a study of Klesmer's head, Hans?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said
Kate. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have often seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Hans, immediately throwing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) head and
mane, seating himself at the piano and looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) were
surveying an amphitheatre, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) fingers down
perpendicularly toward the keys. But then in another instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) wheeled
round on the stool, looked at Mirah and said, half timidly--<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps
you don't like this mimicry; you must always stop my nonsense when you
don't like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah had been smiling at the swiftly-made image, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) smiled still,
but with a touch of something else than amusement, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``Thank
you. But you have never done anything I did not like. I hardly think he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
could, belonging to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) added, looking at Mrs. Meyrick.

<p/>In this way Hans got food for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) hope. How could the rose help it when
several bees in succession took its sweet odor as a sign of personal
attachment?




<p/>CHAPTER XL.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Within the soul a faculty abides,
That with interpositions, which would hide
And darken, so can deal, that they become
Contingencies of pomp; and serve to exalt
Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) native brightness, as the ample moon.
In the deep stillness of a summer even.
Rising behind a thick and lofty grove.
Into a substance glorious as her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own,
Yea, with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own incorporated, by power
Capacious and serene.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--WORDSWORTH: _Excursion_, B. IV.


<p/>Deronda came out of the narrow house at Chelsea in a frame of mind that
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) long for some good bodily exercise to carry off what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
himself inclined to call the fumes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was going toward
the city, and the sight of the Chelsea Stairs with the waiting boats at
once determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to avoid the irritating inaction of being driven in
a cab, by calling a wherry and taking an oar.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) errand was to go to Ram's book-shop, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had yesterday arrived
too late for Mordecai's midday watch, and had been told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
invariably came there again between five and six. Some further
acquaintance with this remarkable inmate of the Cohens was particularly
desired by Deronda as a preliminary to redeeming his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ring: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wished
that their conversation should not again end speedily with that drop of
Mordecai's interest which was like the removal of a drawbridge, and
threatened to shut out any easy communication in future. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) got
warmed with the use of the oar, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind on the errand before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) and the ends he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) wanted to achieve on Mirah's account, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
experienced, as was wont with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), a quick change of mental light,
shifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) point of view to that of the person whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had been
thinking of hitherto chiefly as serviceable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own purposes, and
was inclined to taunt himself with being not much better than an
enlisting sergeant, who never troubles himself with the drama that
brings him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) the needful recruits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose if I got from this man the information I am most anxious
about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>thought Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``I should be contented enough if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt no
disposition to tell me more of himself, or why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to have some
expectation from me which was disappointed. The sort of curiosity he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stirs would die out; and yet it might be that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had neared and parted
as one can imagine two ships doing, each freighted with an exile who
would have recognized the other if the two could have looked out face
to face. Not that there is any likelihood of a peculiar tie between me
and this poor fellow, whose voyage, I fancy, must soon be over. But I
wonder whether there is much of that momentous mutual missing between
people who interchange blank looks, or even long for one another's
absence in a crowded place. However, one makes one's self chances of
missing by going on the recruiting sergeant's plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>When the wherry was approaching Blackfriars Bridge, where Deronda meant
to land, it was half-past four, and the gray day was dying gloriously,
its western clouds all broken into narrowing purple strata before a
wide-spreading saffron clearness, which in the sky had a monumental
calm, but on the river, with its changing objects, was reflected as a
luminous movement, the alternate flash of ripples or currents, the
sudden glow of the brown sail, the passage of laden barges from
blackness into color, making an active response to that brooding glory.

<p/>Feeling well heated by this time, Deronda gave up the oar and drew over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) again his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) Inverness cape. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) head while fastening
the topmost button his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes caught a well-remembered face looking
toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) over the parapet of the bridge--brought out by the western
light into startling distinctness and brilliancy--an illuminated type
of bodily emaciation and spiritual eagerness. It was the face of
Mordecai, who also, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) watch toward the west, had caught sight of
the advancing boat, and had kept it fast within his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) gaze, at first
simply because it was advancing, then with a recovery of impressions
that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) quiver as with a presentiment, till at last the nearing
figure lifted up its face toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)--the face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) visions--and then
immediately, with white uplifted hand, beckoned again and again.

<p/>For Deronda, anxious that Mordecai should recognize and await him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), had
lost no time before signaling, and the answer came straightway.
Mordecai lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) cap and waved it--feeling in that moment that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
inward prophecy was fulfilled. Obstacles, incongruities, all melted
into the sense of completion with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) soul was flooded by this
outward satisfaction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) longing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) exultation was not widely
different from that of the experimenter, bending over the first
stirrings of change that correspond to what in the fervor of
concentrated prevision his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) thought has foreshadowed. The prefigured
friend had come from the golden background, and had signaled to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>):
this actually was: the rest was to be.

<p/>In three minutes Deronda had landed, had paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) boatman, and was
joining Mordecai, whose instinct it was to stand perfectly still and
wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was very glad to see you standing here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``for I was
intending to go on to the book-shop and look for you again. I was there
yesterday--perhaps they mentioned it to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai; <div class="bookquote">``that was the reason I came to the bridge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>This answer, made with simple gravity, was startlingly mysterious to
Deronda. Were the peculiarities of this man really associated with any
sort of mental alienation, according to Cohen's hint?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You knew nothing of my being at Chelsea?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) said, after a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I expected you to come down the river. I have been waiting for
you these five years.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>Mordecai's deep-sunk eyes were fixed on those of
the friend who had at last arrived with a look of affectionate
dependence, at once pathetic and solemn. Deronda's sensitiveness was
not the less responsive because he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not but believe that this
strangely-disclosed relation was founded on an illusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a satisfaction to me if I can be of any real use to you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answered, very earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we get into a cab and drive
to--wherever you wish to go? You have probably had walking enough with
your short breath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go to the book-shop. It will soon be time for me to be there.
But now look up the river,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, turning again toward it and
speaking in undertones of what may be called an excited calm--so
absorbed by a sense of fulfillment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was conscious of no barrier
to a complete understanding between him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) and Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``See the sky, how
it is slowly fading. I have always loved this bridge: I stood on it
when I was a little boy. It is a meeting-place for the spiritual
messengers. It is true--what the Masters said--that each order of
things has its angel: that means the full message of each from what is
afar. Here I have listened to the messages of earth and sky; when I was
stronger I used to stay and watch for the stars in the deep heavens.
But this time just about sunset was always what I loved best. It has
sunk into me and dwelt with me--fading, slowly fading: it was my own
decline: it paused--it waited, till at last it brought me my new
life--my new self--who will live when this breath is all breathed out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda did not speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt himself strangely wrought upon. The
first-prompted suspicion that Mordecai might be liable to
hallucinations of thought--might have become a monomaniac on some
subject which had given too severe a strain to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) diseased
organism--gave way to a more submissive expectancy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) nature was too
large, too ready to conceive regions beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own experience, to rest
at once in the easy explanation, <div class="bookquote">``madness,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whenever a consciousness
showed some fullness and conviction where his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own was blank. It
accorded with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) habitual disposition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) should meet rather than
resist any claim on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) in the shape of another's need; and this claim
brought with it a sense of solemnity which seemed a radiation from
Mordecai, as utterly nullifying his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) outward poverty and lifting him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
into authority as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had been that preternatural guide seen in the
universal legend, who suddenly drops his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mean disguise and stands a
manifest Power. That impression was the more sanctioned by a sort of
resolved quietude which the persuasion of fulfillment had produced in
Mordecai's manner. After they had stood a moment in silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Let us go now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and when they were riding he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``We will get down
at the end of the street and walk to the shop. You can look at the
books, and Mr. Ram will be going away directly and leave us alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed that this enthusiast was just as cautious, just as much alive
to judgments in other minds as if he (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) had been that antipode of all
enthusiasm called <div class="bookquote">``a man of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While they were rattling along in the cab, Mirah was still present with
Deronda in the midst of this strange experience, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) foresaw that
the course of conversation would be determined by Mordecai, not by
himself: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was no longer confident what questions he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) should be able to
ask; and with a reaction on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own mood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) inwardly said, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose
I am in a state of complete superstition, just as if I were awaiting
the destiny that could interpret the oracle. But some strong relation
there must be between me and this man, since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels it strongly.
Great heaven! what relation has proved itself more potent in the world
than faith even when mistaken--than expectation even when perpetually
disappointed? Is my side of the relation to be disappointing or
fulfilling?--well, if it is ever possible for me to fulfill I will not
disappoint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In ten minutes the two men, with as intense a consciousness as if they
had been two undeclared lovers, felt themselves alone in the small
gas-lit book-shop and turned face to face, each baring his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) head from an
instinctive feeling that they wished to see each other fully. Mordecai
came forward to lean his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) back against the little counter, while Deronda
stood against the opposite wall hardly more than four feet off. I wish
I could perpetuate those two faces, as Titian's <div class="bookquote">``Tribute Money''  (<font color='red'><b>Titian</b></font>)</div>has
perpetuated two types presenting another sort of contrast. Imagine--we
all of us can--the pathetic stamp of consumption with its brilliancy of
glance to which the sharply-defined structure of features reminding one
of a forsaken temple, give already a far-off look as of one getting
unwillingly out of reach; and imagine it on a Jewish face naturally
accentuated for the expression of an eager mind--the face of a man
little above thirty, but with that age upon it which belongs to time
lengthened by suffering, the hair and beard, still black, throwing out
the yellow pallor of the skin, the difficult breathing giving more
decided marking to the mobile nostril, the wasted yellow hands
conspicuous on the folded arms: then give to the yearning consumptive
glance something of the slowly dying mother's look, when her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) one loved
son visits her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bedside, and the flickering power of gladness leaps out
as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``My boy!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--for the sense of spiritual perpetuation in
another resembles that maternal transference of self.

<p/>Seeing such a portrait you would see Mordecai. And opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was
a face not more distinctively oriental than many a type seen among what
we call the Latin races; rich in youthful health, and with a forcible
masculine gravity in its repose, that gave the value of judgment to the
reverence with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) met the gaze of this mysterious son of poverty
who claimed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) as a long-expected friend. The more exquisite quality
of Deronda's nature--that keenly perceptive sympathetic emotiveness
which ran along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) speculative tendency--was never more
thoroughly tested. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt nothing that could be called belief in the
validity of Mordecai's impressions concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) or in the probability
of any greatly effective issue: what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) felt was a profound sensibility
to a cry from the depths of another and accompanying that, the summons
to be receptive instead of superciliously prejudging. Receptiveness is
a rare and massive power, like fortitude; and this state of mind now
gave Deronda's face its utmost expression of calm benignant force--an
expression which nourished Mordecai's confidence and made an open way
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) began to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot know what has guided me to you and brought us together at
this moment. You are wondering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not impatient,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``I am ready to listen to whatever
you may wish to disclose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see some of the reasons why I needed you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, speaking
quietly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) wished to reserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) strength. <div class="bookquote">``You see that I am
dying. You see that I am as one shut up behind bars by the wayside, who
if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke to any would be met only by head-shaking and pity. The day
is closing--the light is fading--soon we should not have been able to
discern each other. But you have come in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I rejoice that I am come in time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, feelingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would
not say, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you are not mistaken in me,'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--the very word
<div class="bookquote">``mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought, would be a cruelty at that moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the hidden reasons why I need you began afar off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai;
<div class="bookquote">``began in my early years when I was studying in another land. Then
ideas, beloved ideas, came to me, because I was a Jew. They were a
trust to fulfill, because I was a Jew. They were an inspiration,
because I was a Jew, and felt the heart of my race beating within me.
They were my life; I was not fully born till then. I counted this
heart, and this breath, and this right hand'' (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>--Mordecai had pathetically
pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) breast, and then stretched its wasted fingers
out before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)--``I counted my sleep and my waking, and the work I fed
my body with, and the sights that fed my eyes--I counted them but as
fuel to the divine flame. But I had done as one who wanders and
engraves his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) thought in rocky solitudes, and before I could change my
course came care and labor and disease, and blocked the way before me,
and bound me with the iron that eats itself into the soul. Then I said,
<div class="bookquote">``How shall I save the life within me from being stifled with this
stifled breath?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai paused to rest that poor breath which had been taxed by the
rising excitement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) speech. And also he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) wished to check that
excitement. Deronda dared not speak the very silence in the narrow
space seemed alive with mingled awe and compassion before this
struggling fervor. And presently Mordecai went on--

<p/>``But you may misunderstand me. I speak not as an ignorant dreamer--as
one bred up in the inland valleys, thinking ancient thoughts anew, and
not knowing them ancient, never having stood by the great waters where
the world's knowledge passes to and fro. English is my mother-tongue,
England is the native land of this body, which is but as a breaking pot
of earth around the fruit-bearing tree, whose seed might make the
desert rejoice. But my true life was nourished in Holland at the feet
of my mother's brother, a Rabbi skilled in special learning: and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>) died I went to Hamburg to study, and afterwards to Göttingen, that I
might take a larger outlook on my people, and on the Gentile world, and
drank knowledge at all sources. I was a youth; I felt free; I saw our
chief seats in Germany; I was not then in utter poverty. And I had
possessed myself of a handicraft. For I said, I care not if my lot be
as that of Joshua ben Chananja: after the last destruction he (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) earned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) bread by making needles, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) youth he (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) had been a singer on
the steps of the Temple, and had a memory of what was before the glory
departed. I said, let my body dwell in poverty, and my hands be as the
hands of the toiler: but let my soul be as a temple of remembrance
where the treasures of knowledge enter and the inner sanctuary is hope.
I knew what I chose. They said, ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) feeds himself on visions,<div class="bookquote">'' and I
denied not; for visions are the creators and feeders of the world. I
see, I measure the world as it is, which the vision will create anew.
You are not listening to one who raves aloof from the lives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
fellows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai paused, and Deronda, feeling that the pause was expectant,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Do me the justice to believe that I was not inclined to call
your words raving. I listen that I may know, without prejudgment. I
have had experience which gives me a keen interest in the story of a
spiritual destiny embraced willingly, and embraced in youth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A spiritual destiny embraced willingly--in youth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>Mordecai repeated
in a corrective tone. <div class="bookquote">``It was the soul fully born within me, and it
came in my boyhood. It brought its own world--a mediaeval world, where
there are men who made the ancient language live again in new psalms of
exile. They had absorbed the philosophy of the Gentile into the faith
of the Jew, and they still yearned toward a center for our race. One of
their souls was born again within me, and awakened amid the memories of
their world. It traveled into Spain and Provence; it debated with
Aben-Ezra; it took ship with Jehuda ha-Levi; it heard the roar of the
Crusaders and the shrieks of tortured Israel. And when its dumb tongue
was loosed, it spoke the speech they had made alive with the new blood
of their ardor, their sorrow, and their martyred trust: it sang with
the cadence of their strain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai paused again, and then said in a loud, hoarse whisper--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``While it is imprisoned in me, it will never learn another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you written entirely in Hebrew, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, remembering
with some anxiety the former question as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own knowledge of that
tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, in a tone of deep sadness: ``in my youth I
wandered toward that solitude, not feeling that it was a solitude. I
had the ranks of the great dead around me; the martyrs gathered and
listened. But soon I found that the living were deaf to me. At first I
saw my life spread as a long future: I said part of my Jewish heritage
is an unbreaking patience; part is skill to seek divers methods and
find a rooting-place where the planters despair. But there came new
messengers from the Eternal. I had to bow under the yoke that presses
on the great multitude born of woman: family troubles called me--I had
to work, to care, not for myself alone. I was left solitary again; but
already the angel of death had turned to me and beckoned, and I felt
his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) skirts continually on my path. I loosed not my effort. I besought
hearing and help. I spoke; I went to men of our people--to the rich in
influence or knowledge, to the rich in other wealth. But I found none
to listen with understanding. I was rebuked for error; I was offered a
small sum in charity. No wonder. I looked poor; I carried a bundle of
Hebrew manuscript with me; I said, our chief teachers are misleading
the hope of our race. Scholar and merchant were both too busy to
listen. Scorn stood as interpreter between me and them. One said, ``The
book of Mormon would never have answered in Hebrew; and if you mean to
address our learned men, it is not likely you can teach them anything.<div class="bookquote">''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) touched a truth there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>The last words had a perceptible irony in their hoarsened tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But though you had accustomed yourself to write in Hebrew, few,
surely, can use English better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, wanting to hint
consolation in a new effort for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could smooth the way.

<p/>Mordecai shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) head slowly, and answered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too late--too late. I can write no more. My writing would be like this
gasping breath. But the breath may wake the fount of pity--the writing
not. If I could write now and used English, I should be as one who
beats a board to summon those who have been used to no signal but a
bell. My soul has an ear to hear the faults of its own speech. New
writing of mine would be like this body'' (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>--Mordecai spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
arms--``within it there might be the Ruach-ha-kodesh--the breath of
divine thought--but, men would smile at it and say, ``A poor Jew!<div class="bookquote">'' and
the chief smilers would be of my own people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai let his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hands fall, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) head sink in melancholy: for the
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had lost hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hope. Despondency, conjured up by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
own words, had floated in and hovered above him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) with eclipsing wings.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had sunk into momentary darkness,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel with you--I feel strongly with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, in a clear
deep voice which was itself a cordial, apart from the words of
sympathy. <div class="bookquote">``But forgive me if I speak hastily--for what you have
actually written there need be no utter burial. The means of
publication are within reach. If you will rely on me, I can assure you
of all that is necessary to that end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, quickly, looking up again with the
flash of recovered memory and confidence. <div class="bookquote">``That is not all my trust in
you. You must be not only a hand to me, but a soul--believing my
belief--being moved by my reasons--hoping my hope-seeing the vision I
point to--beholding a glory where I behold it!'' (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>--Mordecai had taken a
step nearer as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) spoke, and now laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hand on Deronda's arm with a
tight grasp; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) face little more than a foot off had something like a
pale flame in it--an intensity of reliance that acted as a peremptory
claim, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) went on--<div class="bookquote">``You will be my life: it will be planted
afresh; it will grow. You shall take the inheritance; it has been
gathering for ages. The generations are crowding on my narrow life as a
bridge: what has been and what is to be are meeting there; and the
bridge is breaking. But I have found you. You have come in time, You
will take the inheritance which the base son refuses because of the
tombs which the plow and harrow may not pass over or the gold-seeker
disturb: you will take the sacred inheritance of the Jew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda had become as pallid as Mordecai. Quick as an alarm of flood or
fire, there spread within him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) not only a compassionate dread of
discouraging this fellowman who urged a prayer as one in the last
agony, but also the opposing dread of fatally feeding an illusion, and
being hurried on to a self-committal which might turn into a falsity.
The peculiar appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) tenderness overcame the repulsion that most
of us experience under a grasp and speech which assumed to dominate.
The difficulty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was to inflict the accents of hesitation and
doubt on this ardent suffering creature, who was crowding too much of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) brief being into a moment of perhaps extravagant trust. With
exquisite instinct, Deronda, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) lips, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) palm
gently on Mordecai's straining hand--an act just then equal to many
speeches. And after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, without haste, as if conscious that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might be wrong--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you forget what I told you when we first saw each other? Do you
remember that I said I was not of your race?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't be true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>Mordecai whispered immediately, with no sign of
shock. The sympathetic hand still upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had fortified the feeling
which was stronger than those words of denial. There was a perceptible
pause, Deronda feeling it impossible to answer, conscious indeed that
the assertion <div class="bookquote">``It can't be true'' (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>--had the pressure of argument for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).
Mordecai, too entirely possessed by the supreme importance of the
relation between himself and Deronda to have any other care in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
speech, followed up that assertion by a second, which came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) lips
as a mere sequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) long-cherished conviction--<div class="bookquote">``You are not sure
of your own origin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Daniel, with an habitual shrinking which
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) remove his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) hands from Mordecai's, who also relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hold,
and fell back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) former leaning position.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it--I know it; what is my life else?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, with a low
cry of impatience. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me everything: tell me why you deny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) could have no conception what that demand was to the hearer--how
probingly it touched the hidden sensibility, the vividly conscious
reticence of years; how the uncertainty he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was insisting on as part of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own hope had always for Daniel been a threatening possibility of
painful revelation about his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) mother. But the moment had influences
which were not only new but solemn to Deronda; any evasion here might
turn out to be a hateful refusal of some task that belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>),
some act of due fellowship; in any case it would be a cruel rebuff to a
being who was appealing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as a forlorn hope under the shadow of a
coming doom. After a few moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, with a great effort over
himself--determined to tell all the truth briefly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never known my mother. I have no knowledge about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I have
never called any man father. But I am convinced that my father is an
Englishman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda's deep tones had a tremor in them as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) uttered this
confession; and all the while there was an undercurrent of amazement in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) at the strange circumstances under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) uttered it. It seemed
as if Mordecai were hardly overrating his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own power to determine the
action of the friend whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had mysteriously chosen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be seen--it will be declared,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, triumphantly.
<div class="bookquote">``The world grows, and its frame is knit together by the growing soul;
dim, dim at first, then clearer and more clear, the consciousness
discerns remote stirrings. As thoughts move within us darkly, and shake
us before they are fully discerned--so events--so beings: they are knit
with us in the growth of the world. You have risen within me like a
thought not fully spelled; my soul is shaken before the words are all
there. The rest will come--it will come.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must not lose sight of the fact that the outward event has not
always been a fulfillment of the firmest faith,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, in a
tone that was made hesitating by the painfully conflicting desires, not
to give any severe blow to Mordecai, and not to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) confidence a
sanction which might have the severest of blows in reserve.

<p/>Mordecai's face, which had been illuminated to the utmost in that last
declaration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) confidence, changed under Deronda's words, not only
into any show of collapsed trust: the force did not disappear from the
expression, but passed from the triumphant into the firmly resistant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would remind me that I may be under an illusion--that the history
of our people's trust has been full of illusion. I face it all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>Here
Mordecai paused a moment. Then bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) head a little forward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hoarse whisper, <div class="bookquote">''_So it might be with my trust, if you
would make it an illusion. But you will not._''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The very sharpness with which these words penetrated Deronda made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
feel the more that here was a crisis in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) must be firm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What my birth was does not lie in my will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``My sense of
claims on me cannot be independent of my knowledge there. And I cannot
promise you that I will try to hasten a disclosure. Feelings which have
struck root through half my life may still hinder me from doing what I
have never been able to do. Everything must be waited for. I must know
more of the truth about my own life, and I must know more of what it
would become if it were made a part of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai had folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) arms again while Deronda was speaking, and now
answered with equal firmness, though with difficult breathing--

<p/>``You _shall_ know. What are we met for, but that you should know. Your
doubts lie as light as dust on my belief. I know the philosophies of
this time and of other times; if I chose I could answer a summons
before their tribunals. I could silence the beliefs which are the
mother-tongue of my soul and speak with the rote-learned language of a
system, that gives you the spelling of all things, sure of its alphabet
covering them all. I could silence them: may not a man silence his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) awe
or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love, and take to finding reasons, which others demand? But if
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love lies deeper than any reasons to be found? Man finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>)
pathways: at first they were foot tracks, as those of the beast in the
wilderness: now they are swift and invisible: his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) thought dives through
the ocean, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) wishes thread the air: has he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) found all the pathways
yet? What reaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>), stays with him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>), rules him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) must accept it,
not knowing its pathway. Say, my expectation of you has grown but as
false hopes grow. That doubt is in your mind? Well, my expectation was
there, and you are come. Men have died of thirst. But I was thirsty,
and the water is on my lips! What are doubts to me? In the hour when
you come to me and say, <div class="bookquote">``I reject your soul: I know that I am not a
Jew: we have no lot in common'--I shall not doubt. I shall be
certain--certain that I have been deluded. That hour will never come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda felt a new chord sounding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) speech: it was rather
imperious than appealing--had more of conscious power than of the
yearning need which had acted as a beseeching grasp on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) before. And
usually, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was the reverse of pugnacious, such a change of
attitude toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would have weakened his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) inclination to admit a
claim. But here there was something that balanced his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) resistance and
kept it aloof. This strong man whose gaze was sustainedly calm and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
finger-nails pink with health, who was exercised in all questioning,
and accused of excessive mental independence, still felt a subduing
influence over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the tenacious certitude of the fragile creature
before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), whose pallid yellow nostril was tense with effort as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
breath labored under the burthen of eager speech. The influence seemed
to strengthen the bond of sympathetic obligation. In Deronda at this
moment the desire to escape what might turn into a trying embarrassment
was no more likely to determine action than the solicitations of
indolence are likely to determine it in one with whom industry is a
daily law. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answered simply--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my wish to meet and satisfy your wishes wherever that is
possible to me. It is certain to me at least that I desire not to
undervalue your toil and your suffering. Let me know your thoughts. But
where can we meet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai. <div class="bookquote">``It is not hard for you to
come into this neighborhood later in the evening? You did so once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can manage it very well occasionally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``You live under
the same roof with the Cohens, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Before Mordecai could answer, Mr. Ram re-entered to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Ram</b></font>) place
behind the counter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ram</b></font>) was an elderly son of Abraham, whose childhood
had fallen on the evil times at the beginning of this century, and who
remained amid this smart and instructed generation as a preserved
specimen, soaked through and through with the effect of the poverty and
contempt which were the common heritage of most English Jews seventy
years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) had none of the oily cheerfulness observable in Mr.
Cohen's aspect: his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) very features--broad and chubby--showed that
tendency to look mongrel without due cause, which, in a miscellaneous
London neighborhood, may perhaps be compared with the marvels of
imitation in insects, and may have been nature's imperfect effort on
behalf of the pure Caucasian to shield him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) from the shame and spitting
to which purer features would have been exposed in the times of zeal.
Mr. Ram dealt ably in books, in the same way that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ram</b></font>) would have dealt
in tins of meat and other commodities--without knowledge or
responsibility as to the proportion of rottenness or nourishment they
might contain. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ram</b></font>) believed in Mordecai's learning as something
marvellous, and was not sorry that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ram</b></font>) conversation should be sought by
a bookish gentleman, whose visits had twice ended in a purchase. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ram</b></font>)
greeted Deronda with a crabbed good-will, and, putting on large silver
spectacles, appeared at once to abstract himself in the daily accounts.

<p/>But Deronda and Mordecai were soon in the street together, and without
any explicit agreement as to their direction, were walking toward Ezra
Cohen's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't meet there: my room is too narrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, taking up
the thread of talk where they had dropped it. <div class="bookquote">``But there is a tavern
not far from here where I sometimes go to a club. It is the _Hand and
Banner_, in the street at the next turning, five doors down. We can
have the parlor there any evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can try that for once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``But you will perhaps let me
provide you with some lodging, which would give you more freedom and
comfort than where you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I need nothing. My outer life is as nought. I will take nothing
less precious from you than your soul's brotherhood. I will think of
nothing else yet. But I am glad you are rich. You did not need money on
that diamond ring. You had some other motive for bringing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda was a little startled by this clear-sightedness; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
could reply Mordecai added--<div class="bookquote">``it is all one. Had you been in need of the
money, the great end would have been that we should meet again. But you
are rich?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) ended, in a tone of interrogation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not rich, except in the sense that every one is rich who has more than
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) needs for himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I desired that your life should be free,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai,
dreamily--<div class="bookquote">``mine has been a bondage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>It was clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had no interest in the fact of Deronda's
appearance at the Cohens' beyond its relation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own ideal purpose.
Despairing of leading easily up to the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wished to ask,
Deronda determined to put it abruptly, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me why Mrs. Cohen, the mother, must not be spoken to
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no immediate answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should have to
repeat the question. The fact was that Mordecai had heard the words,
but had to drag his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind to a new subject away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) passionate
preoccupation. After a few moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) replied with a careful effort
such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) would have used if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had been asked the road to Holborn--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know the reason. But I will not speak even of trivial family affairs
which I have heard in the privacy of the family. I dwell in their tent
as in a sanctuary. Their history, so far as they injure none other, is
their own possession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda felt the blood mounting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) cheeks as a sort of rebuke he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
was little used to, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) also found himself painfully baffled where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had reckoned with some confidence on getting decisive knowledge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
became the more conscious of emotional strain from the excitements of
the day; and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had the money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) pocket to redeem his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
ring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) recoiled from the further task of a visit to the Cohens',
which must be made not only under the former uncertainty, but under a
new disappointment as to the possibility of its removal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will part from you now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, just before they could reach
Cohen's door; and Mordecai paused, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) with an anxious
fatigued face under the gaslight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When will you come back?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) said, with slow emphasis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I leave that unfixed? May I ask for you at the Cohens' any evening
after your hour at the book-shop? There is no objection, I suppose, to
their knowing that you and I meet in private?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai. <div class="bookquote">``But the days I wait now are longer than the
years of my strength. Life shrinks: what was but a tithe is now the
half. My hope abides in you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be faithful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda--he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not have left those words
unuttered. <div class="bookquote">``I will come the first evening I can after seven: on
Saturday or Monday, if possible. Trust me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ungloved hand. Mordecai, clasping it eagerly, seemed to
feel a new instreaming of confidence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) said with some recovered
energy--<div class="bookquote">``This is come to pass, and the rest will come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>That was their good-bye.




<p/>BOOK VI--REVELATIONS


<p/>CHAPTER XLI.

<p/>``This, too is probable, according to that saying of Agathon: <div class="bookquote">``It is a
part of probability that many improbable things will happen.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--ARISTOTLE: _Poetics_.


<p/>Imagine the conflict in a mind like Deronda's given not only to feel
strongly but to question actively, on the evening after the interview
with Mordecai. To a young man of much duller susceptibilities the
adventure might have seemed enough out of the common way to divide his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
thoughts; but it had stirred Deronda so deeply, that with the usual
reaction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) intellect he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) began to examine the grounds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
emotion, and consider how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) must resist its guidance. The
consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was half dominated by Mordecai's energetic
certitude, and still more by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) fervent trust, roused his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) alarm. It
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) characteristic bias to shrink from the moral stupidity of
valuing lightly what had come close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), and of missing blindly in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own life of to-day the crisis which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) recognized as momentous and
sacred in the historic life of men. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had read of this incident as
having happened centuries ago in Rome, Greece, Asia Minor, Palestine,
Cairo, to some man young as himself, dissatisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neutral
life, and wanting some closer fellowship, some more special duty to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ardor for the possible consequences of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work, it would have
appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quite natural that the incident should have created a
deep impression on that far-off man, whose clothing and action would
have been seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imagination as part of an age chiefly known to us
through its more serious effects. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
agitated feeling merely because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dressed for dinner, wore a white
tie, and lived among people who might laugh at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owning any
conscience in the matter, as the solemn folly of taking himself too
seriously?--that bugbear of circles in which the lack of grave emotion
passes for wit. From such cowardice before modish ignorance and
obtuseness, Deronda shrank. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) also shrank from having his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) course
determined by mere contagion, without consent of reason; or from
allowing a reverential pity for spiritual struggle to hurry him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) along a
dimly-seen path.

<p/>What, after all, had really happened? He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) knew quite accurately the
answer Sir Hugo would have given: <div class="bookquote">``A consumptive Jew, possessed by a
fanaticism which obstacles and hastening death intensified, had fixed
on Deronda as the antitype of some visionary image, the offspring of
wedded hope and despair: despair of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own life, irrepressible hope in
the propagation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) fanatical beliefs. The instance was perhaps odd,
exceptional in its form, but substantially it was not rare. Fanaticism
was not so common as bankruptcy, but taken in all its aspects it was
abundant enough. While Mordecai was waiting on the bridge for the
fulfillment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) visions, another man was convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the
mathematical key of the universe which would supersede Newton, and
regarded all known physicists as conspiring to stifle his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) discovery and
keep the universe locked; another, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) had the metaphysical key,
with just that hair's-breadth of difference from the old wards which
would make it fit exactly. Scattered here and there in every direction
you might find a terrible person, with more or less power of speech,
and with an eye either glittering or preternaturally dull, on the
look-out for the man who must hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and in most cases he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
volumes which it was difficult to get printed, or if printed to get
read. This Mordecai happened to have a more pathetic aspect, a more
passionate, penetrative speech than was usual with such monomaniacs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
was more poetical than a social reformer with colored views of the new
moral world in parallelograms, or than an enthusiast in sewage; still
he (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) came under the same class. It would be only right and kind to
indulge him (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) a little, to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) with such help as was practicable;
but what likelihood was there that his (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) notions had the sort of value he (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>)
ascribed to them? In such cases a man of the world knows what to think
beforehand. And as to Mordecai's conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had found a new
executive self, it might be preparing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) the worst of
disappointments--that which presents itself as final.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda's ear caught all these negative whisperings; nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) repeated
them distinctly to himself. It was not the first but it was the most
pressing occasion on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had had to face this question of the
family likeness among the heirs of enthusiasm, whether prophets or
dreamers of dreams, whether the

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great benefactors of mankind, deliverers,''

 (<font color='red'><b>dreamers</b></font>)</div><p/>or the devotees of phantasmal discovery--from the first believer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
own unmanifested inspiration, down to the last inventor of an ideal
machine that will achieve perpetual motion. The kinship of human
passion, the sameness of mortal scenery, inevitably fill fact with
burlesque and parody. Error and folly have had their hecatombs of
martyrs. Reduce the grandest type of man hitherto known to an abstract
statement of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) qualities and efforts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appears in dangerous
company: say that, like Copernicus and Galileo, he (<font color='blue'><b>Galileo</b></font>) was immovably
convinced in the face of hissing incredulity; but so is the contriver
of perpetual motion. We cannot fairly try the spirits by this sort of
test. If we want to avoid giving the dose of hemlock or the sentence of
banishment in the wrong case, nothing will do but a capacity to
understand the subject-matter on which the immovable man is convinced,
and fellowship with human travail, both near and afar, to hinder us
from scanning and deep experience lightly. Shall we say, <div class="bookquote">``Let the ages
try the spirits, and see what they are worth?''  (<font color='red'><b>the ages</b></font>)</div>Why, we are the
beginning of the ages, which can only be just by virtue of just
judgments in separate human breasts--separate yet combined. Even
steam-engines could not have got made without that condition, but must
have stayed in the mind of James Watt.

<p/>This track of thinking was familiar enough to Deronda to have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
from any contemptuous prejudgment of Mordecai, even if their
communication had been free from that peculiar claim on himself
strangely ushered in by some long-growing preparation in the Jew's
agitated mind. This claim, indeed, considered in what is called a
rational way, might seem justifiably dismissed as illusory and even
preposterous; but it was precisely what turned Mordecai's hold on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
from an appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) ready sympathy into a clutch on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) struggling
conscience. Our consciences are not all of the same pattern, an inner
deliverance of fixed laws: they are the voice of sensibilities as
various as our memories -LRB-which also have their kinship and likeness-RRB-.
And Deronda's conscience included sensibilities beyond the common,
enlarged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) early habit of thinking himself imaginatively into the
experience of others.

<p/>What was the claim this eager soul made upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)?--<div class="bookquote">``You must believe my
beliefs--be moved by my reasons--hope my hopes--see the vision I point
to--behold a glory where I behold it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>To take such a demand in the
light of an obligation in any direct sense would have been
preposterous--to have seemed to admit it would have been dishonesty;
and Deronda, looking on the agitation of those moments, felt thankful
that in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) compassion he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had preserved himself from the
bondage of false concessions. The claim hung, too, on a supposition
which might be--nay, probably was--in discordance with the full fact:
the supposition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), Deronda, was of Jewish blood. Was there ever a
more hypothetic appeal?

<p/>But since the age of thirteen Deronda had associated the deepest
experience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) affections with what was a pure supposition, namely,
that Sir Hugo was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) father: that was a hypothesis which had been the
source of passionate struggle within him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>); by its light he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had been
accustomed to subdue feelings and to cherish them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had been well
used to find a motive in a conception which might be disproved; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
had been also used to think of some revelation that might influence his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
view of the particular duties belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>). To be in a state of
suspense, which was also one of emotive activity and scruple, was a
familiar attitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) conscience.

<p/>And now, suppose that wish-begotten belief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) Jewish birth, and
that extravagant demand of discipleship, to be the foreshadowing of an
actual discovery and a genuine spiritual result: suppose that
Mordecai's ideas made a real conquest over Deronda's conviction? Nay,
it was conceivable that as Mordecai needed and believed that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had
found an active replenishment of himself, so Deronda might receive from
Mordecai's mind the complete ideal shape of that personal duty and
citizenship which lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own thought like sculptured fragments
certifying some beauty yearned after but not traceable by divination.

<p/>As that possibility presented itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) meditations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was aware
that it would be called dreamy, and began to defend it. If the
influence he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagined himself submitting to had been that of some
honored professor, some authority in a seat of learning, some
philosopher who had been accepted as a voice of the age, would a
thorough receptiveness toward direction have been ridiculed? Only by
those who hold it a sign of weakness to be obliged for an idea, and
prefer to hint that they have implicitly held in a more correct form
whatever others have stated with a sadly short-coming explicitness.
After all, what was there but vulgarity in taking the fact that
Mordecai was a poor Jewish workman, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was to be met perhaps
on a sanded floor in the parlor of the _Hand and Banner_ as a reason
for determining beforehand that there was not some spiritual force
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) that might have a determining effect on a white-handed
gentleman? There is a legend told of the Emperor Domitian, that having
heard of a Jewish family, of the house of David, whence the ruler of
the world was to spring, he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) sent for its members in alarm, but quickly
released them on observing that they had the hands of
work-people--being of just the opposite opinion with that Rabbi who
stood waiting at the gate of Rome in confidence that the Messiah would
be found among the destitute who entered there. Both Emperor and Rabbi
were wrong in their trust of outward signs: poverty and poor clothes
are no sign of inspiration, said Deronda to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) inward objector, but
they have gone with it in some remarkable cases. And to regard
discipleship as out of the question because of them, would be mere
dullness of imagination.

<p/>A more plausible reason for putting discipleship out of the question
was the strain of visionary excitement in Mordecai, which turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
wishes into overmastering impressions, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) read outward facts
as fulfillment. Was such a temper of mind likely to accompany that wise
estimate of consequences which is the only safeguard from fatal error,
even to ennobling motive? But it remained to be seen whether that rare
conjunction existed or not in Mordecai: perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) might be one of the
natures where a wise estimate of consequences is fused in the fires of
that passionate belief which determines the consequences it believes
in. The inspirations of the world have come in that way too: even
strictly-measuring science could hardly have got on without that
forecasting ardor which feels the agitations of discovery beforehand,
and has a faith in its preconception that surmounts many failures of
experiment. And in relation to human motives and actions, passionate
belief has a fuller efficacy. Here enthusiasm may have the validity of
proof, and happening in one soul, give the type of what will one day be
general.

<p/>At least, Deronda argued, Mordecai's visionary excitability was hardly
a reason for concluding beforehand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not worth listening to
except for pity sake. Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had introduced himself as one of the
strictest reasoners. Do they form a body of men hitherto free from
false conclusions and illusory speculations? The driest argument has
its hallucinations, too hastily concluding that its net will now at
last be large enough to hold the universe. Men may dream in
demonstrations, and cut out an illusory world in the shape of axioms,
definitions, and propositions, with a final exclusion of fact signed
Q.E.D. No formulas for thinking will save us mortals from mistake in
our imperfect apprehension of the matter to be thought about. And since
the unemotional intellect may carry us into a mathematical dreamland
where nothing is but what is not, perhaps an emotional intellect may
have absorbed into its passionate vision of possibilities some truth of
what will be--the more comprehensive massive life feeding theory with
new material, as the sensibility of the artist seizes combinations
which science explains and justifies. At any rate, presumptions to the
contrary are not to be trusted. We must be patient with the inevitable
makeshift of our human thinking, whether in its sum total or in the
separate minds that have made the sum. Columbus had some impressions
about himself which we call superstitions, and used some arguments
which we disapprove; but he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had also some sound physical conceptions,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had the passionate patience of genius to make them tell on
mankind. The world has made up its mind rather contemptuously about
those who were deaf to Columbus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My contempt for them binds me to see that I don't adopt their mistake
on a small scale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, ``and make myself deaf with the
assumption that there cannot be any momentous relation between this Jew
and me, simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) has clad it in illusory notions. What I can
be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), or he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) to me, may not at all depend on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) persuasion about
the way we came together. To me the way seems made up of plainly
discernible links. If I had not found Mirah, it is probable that I
should not have begun to be specially interested in the Jews, and
certainly I should not have gone on that loitering search after an Ezra
Cohen which made me pause at Ram's book-shop and ask the price of
_Maimon_. Mordecai, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) side, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) visions of a disciple, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
saw me by their light; I corresponded well enough with the image his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
longing had created. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) took me for one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) race. Suppose that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
impression--the elderly Jew at Frankfort seemed to have something like
it--suppose in spite of all presumptions to the contrary, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
impression should somehow be proved true, and that I should come
actually to share any of the ideas he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) is devoted to? This is the only
question which really concerns the effect of our meeting on my life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if the issue should be quite different?--well, there will be
something painful to go through. I shall almost inevitably have to be
an active cause of that poor fellow's crushing disappointment. Perhaps
this issue is the one I had need prepare myself for. I fear that no
tenderness of mine can make his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) suffering lighter. Would the
alternative--that I should not disappoint him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)--be less painful to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Deronda wavered. Feelings had lately been at work within him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) which
had very much modified the reluctance he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would formerly have had to
think of himself as probably a Jew. And, if you like, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was romantic.
That young energy and spirit of adventure which have helped to create
the world-wide legions of youthful heroes going to seek the hidden
tokens of their birth and its inheritance of tasks, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) a certain
quivering interest in the bare possibility that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was entering on a
track like--all the more because the track was one of thought as well
as action.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The bare possibility.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could not admit it to be more. The belief
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) father was an Englishman only grew firmer under the weak
assaults of unwarranted doubt. And that a moment should ever come in
which that belief was declared a delusion, was something of which
Deronda would not say, <div class="bookquote">``I should be glad.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life-long affection for
Sir Hugo, stronger than all his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) resentment, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shrink from
admitting that wish.

<p/>Which way soever the truth might lie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) repeated to himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
had said to Mordecai--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not without farther reasons
undertake to hasten its discovery. Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was tempted now to regard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) uncertainty as a condition to be cherished for the present. If
further intercourse revealed nothing but illusions as what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
expected to share in, the want of any valid evidence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was a Jew
might save Mordecai the worst shock in the refusal of fraternity. It
might even be justifiable to use the uncertainty on this point in
keeping up a suspense which would induce Mordecai to accept those
offices of friendship that Deronda longed to urge on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/>These were the meditations that busied Deronda in the interval of four
days before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could fulfill his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) promise to call for Mordecai at Ezra
Cohen's, Sir Hugo's demands on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) often lasting to an hour so late as
to put the evening expedition to Holborn out of the question.




<p/>CHAPTER XLII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wenn es eine Stutenleiter von Leiden giebt, so hat Israel die höchste
Staffel erstiegen; wen die Dauer der Schmerzen und die Geduld, mit
welcher sie ertragen werden, adeln, so nehmen es die Juden mit den
Hochgeborenen aller Länder auf; wenn eine Literatur reich genannt
wird, die wenige klassische Trauerspiele besitzt, welcher Platz
gebührt dann einer Tragodie die anderthalb Jahrtausende wahrt,
gedichtet und dargestellt von den Helden selber?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--ZUNZ: _Die
Synagogale Poesie des Mittelalters._


<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there are ranks in suffering, Israel takes precedence of all the
nations--if the duration of sorrows and the patience with which they
are borne ennoble, the Jews are among the aristocracy of every land--if
a literature is called rich in the possession of a few classic
tragedies, what shall we say to a National Tragedy lasting for fifteen
hundred years, in which the poets and the actors were also the heroes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda had lately been reading that passage of Zunz, and it occurred
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) by way of contrast when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was going to the Cohens, who
certainly bore no obvious stamp of distinction in sorrow or in any
other form of aristocracy. Ezra Cohen was not clad in the sublime
pathos of the martyr, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) taste for money-getting seemed to be
favored with that success which has been the most exasperating
difference in the greed of Jews during all the ages of their
dispersion. This Jeshurun of a pawnbroker was not a symbol of the great
Jewish tragedy; and yet was there not something typical in the fact
that a life like Mordecai's--a frail incorporation of the national
consciousness, breathing with difficult breath--was nested in the
self-gratulating ignorant prosperity of the Cohens?

<p/>Glistening was the gladness in their faces when Deronda reappeared
among them. Cohen himself took occasion to intimate that although the
diamond ring, let alone a little longer, would have bred more money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>)
did not mind _that_--not a sixpence--when compared with the pleasure of
the women and children in seeing a young gentleman whose first visit
had been so agreeable that they had <div class="bookquote">``done nothing but talk of it ever
since.''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>Young Mrs. Cohen was very sorry that baby was asleep, and then
very glad that Adelaide was not yet gone to bed, entreating Deronda not
to stay in the shop, but to go forthwith into the parlor to see <div class="bookquote">``mother
and the children.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) willingly accepted the invitation, having
provided himself with portable presents; a set of paper figures for
Adelaide, and an ivory cup and ball for Jacob.

<p/>The grandmother had a pack of cards before her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) and was making <div class="bookquote">``plates''
 (<font color='red'><b>The grandmother</b></font>)</div>with the children. A plate had just been thrown down and kept itself
whole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, running to Deronda as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) entered. <div class="bookquote">``Don't tread on
my plate. Stop and see me throw it up again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda complied, exchanging a smile of understanding with the
grandmother, and the plate bore several tossings before it came to
pieces; then the visitor was allowed to come forward and seat himself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) observed that the door from which Mordecai had issued on the former
visit was now closed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) wished to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) interest in the Cohens
before disclosing a yet stronger interest in their singular inmate.

<p/>It was not until he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had Adelaide on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) knee, and was setting up the
paper figures in their dance on the table, while Jacob was already
practicing with the cup and ball, that Deronda said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mordecai in just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), Addy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Cohen, who had seized an interval of business
to come and look on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the workroom there,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) wife, nodding toward the closed door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Cohen, <div class="bookquote">``we don't know what's come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>) this
last day or two. He (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>)'s always what I may call a little touched, you
know'' (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>--here Cohen pointed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) own forehead--<div class="bookquote">``not quite so rational
in all things, like you and me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Addy</b></font>)'s mostly wonderful regular and
industrious so far as a poor creature can be, and takes as much delight
in the boy as anybody could. But this last day or two he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s been moving
about like a sleep-walker, or else sitting as still as a wax figure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the disease, poor dear creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div>said the grandmother, tenderly.
<div class="bookquote">``I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can stand long against it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I think its only something he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s got in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cohen/Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cohen
the younger. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s been turning over writing continually, and when I
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) it takes him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ever so long to hear and answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may think us a little weak ourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Cohen, apologetically.
<div class="bookquote">``But my wife and mother wouldn't part with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a still worse
encumbrance. It isn't that we don't know the long and short of matters,
but it's our principle. There's fools do business at a loss and don't
know it. I'm not one of 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mordecai carries a blessing inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div>said the grandmother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)'s got something the matter inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, coming up to
correct this erratum of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) grandmother's. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) couldn't talk to
me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) wouldn't have a bit o' bun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So far from wondering at your feeling for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``I
already feel something of the same sort myself. I have lately talked to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) at Ram's book-shop--in fact, I promised to call for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) here, that
we might go out together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Cohen, slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) knee. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)'s been expecting
you, and it's taken hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) talks about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) learning
to you. It's uncommonly kind of _you_, sir; for I don't suppose there's
much to be got out of it, else it wouldn't have left him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) is.
But there's the shop.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>Cohen hurried out, and Jacob, who had been
listening inconveniently near to Deronda's elbow, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) with
obliging familiarity, <div class="bookquote">``I'll call Mordecai for you, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Jacob,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) mother; <div class="bookquote">``open the door for the gentleman, and let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) go in himself Hush! don't make a noise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Skillful Jacob seemed to enter into the play, and turned the handle of
the door as noiselessly as possible, while Deronda went behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and
stood on the threshold. The small room was lit only by a dying fire and
one candle with a shade over it. On the board fixed under the window,
various objects of jewelry were scattered: some books were heaped in
the corner beyond them. Mordecai was seated on a high chair at the
board with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) back to the door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hands resting on each other and on
the board, a watch propped on a stand before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was in a state of
expectation as sickening as that of a prisoner listening for the
delayed deliverance--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) heard Deronda's voice saying, <div class="bookquote">``I am come
for you. Are you ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) turned without speaking, seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) furred cap which lay
near, and moved to join Deronda. It was but a moment before they were
both in the sitting-room, and Jacob, noticing the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
friend's air and expression, seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) by the arm and said, <div class="bookquote">``See my
cup and ball!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>sending the ball up close to Mordecai's face, as
something likely to cheer a convalescent. It was a sign of the relieved
tension in Mordecai's mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) could smile and say, <div class="bookquote">``Fine, fine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have forgotten your greatcoat and comforter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cohen/Cohen</b></font>)</div>said young Mrs.
Cohen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) went back into the work-room and got them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)'s come to life again, do you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Cohen, who had
re-entered--speaking in an undertone. <div class="bookquote">``I told you so: I'm mostly
right.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) usual voice, <div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, we mustn't detain you now,
I suppose; but I hope this isn't the last time we shall see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you come again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, advancing. <div class="bookquote">``See, I can catch the
ball; I'll bet I catch it without stopping, if you come again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) has clever hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, looking at the grandmother. <div class="bookquote">``Which
side of the family does he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) get them from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div><p/>But the grandmother only nodded towards her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) son, who said promptly, <div class="bookquote">``My
side. My wife's family are not in that line. But bless your soul! ours
is a sort of cleverness as good as gutta percha; you can twist it which
way you like. There's nothing some old gentlemen won't do if you set
'em to it.''  (<font color='red'><b>son side</b></font>)</div>Here Cohen winked down at Jacob's back, but it was doubtful
whether this judicious allusiveness answered its purpose, for its
subject gave a nasal whinnying laugh and stamped about singing, <div class="bookquote">``Old
gentlemen, old gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>in chiming cadence.

<p/>Deronda thought, <div class="bookquote">``I shall never know anything decisive about these
people until I ask Cohen pointblank whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) lost a sister named
Mirah when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was six years old.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>The decisive moment did not yet seem
easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to face. Still his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) first sense of repulsion at the
commonness of these people was beginning to be tempered with kindlier
feeling. However unrefined their airs and speech might be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
forced to admit some moral refinement in their treatment of the
consumptive workman, whose mental distinction impressed them chiefly as
a harmless, silent raving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Cohens seem to have an affection for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and Mordecai were off the doorstep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I for them,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the immediate answer. <div class="bookquote">``They have the heart of the
Israelite within them, though they are as the horse and the mule,
without understanding beyond the narrow path they tread.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have caused you some uneasiness, I fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``by my
slowness in fulfilling my promise. I wished to come yesterday, but I
found it impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes, I trusted you. But it is true I have been uneasy, for the
spirit of my youth has been stirred within me, and this body is not
strong enough to bear the beating of its wings. I am as a man bound and
imprisoned through long years: behold him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought to speech of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fellow and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) limbs set free: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) weeps, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) totters, the joy within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
threatens to break and overthrow the tabernacle of flesh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not speak too much in this evening air,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
feeling Mordecai's words of reliance like so many cords binding him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
painfully. <div class="bookquote">``Cover your mouth with the woolen scarf. We are going to the
_Hand and Banner_, I suppose, and shall be in private there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that is my trouble that you did not come yesterday. For this is
the evening of the club I spoke of, and we might not have any minutes
alone until late, when all the rest are gone. Perhaps we had better
seek another place. But I am used to that only. In new places the outer
world presses on me and narrows the inward vision. And the people there
are familiar with my face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind the club if I am allowed to go in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``It is
enough that you like this place best. If we have not enough time I will
come again. What sort of club is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Philosophers</b></font>)</div><p/>``It is called ``The Philosophers.<div class="bookquote">'' They are few--like the cedars of
Lebanon--poor men given to thought. But none so poor as I am: and
sometimes visitors of higher worldly rank have been brought. We are
allowed to introduce a friend, who is interested in our topics. Each
orders beer or some other kind of drink, in payment for the room. Most
of them smoke. I have gone when I could, for there are other men of my
race who come, and sometimes I have broken silence. I have pleased
myself with a faint likeness between these poor philosophers and the
Masters who handed down the thought of our race--the great
Transmitters, who labored with their hands for scant bread, but
preserved and enlarged for us the heritage of memory, and saved the
soul of Israel alive as a seed among the tombs. The heart pleases
itself with faint resemblances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Philosophers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very glad to go and sit among them, if that will suit you.
It is a sort of meeting I should like to join in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, not
without relief in the prospect of an interval before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went through
the strain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) next private conversation with Mordecai.

<p/>In three minutes they had opened the glazed door with the red curtain,
and were in the little parlor, hardly much more than fifteen feet
square, where the gaslight shone through a slight haze of smoke on what
to Deronda was a new and striking scene. Half-a-dozen men of various
ages, from between twenty and thirty to fifty, all shabbily dressed,
most of them with clay pipes in their mouths, were listening with a
look of concentrated intelligence to a man in a pepper-and-salt dress,
with blonde hair, short nose, broad forehead and general breadth, who,
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe slightly uplifted in the left hand, and beating his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knee with the right, was just finishing a quotation from Shelley -LRB-the
comparison of the avalanche in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelley</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Prometheus Unbound'' (<font color='red'><b>SHELLEY/Shelley</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As thought by thought is piled, till some great truth
Is loosened, and the nations echo round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>SHELLEY/Shelley</b></font>)</div><p/>The entrance of the new-comers broke the fixity of attention, and
called for re-arrangement of seats in the too narrow semicircle round
the fire-place and the table holding the glasses, spare pipes and
tobacco. This was the soberest of clubs; but sobriety is no reason why
smoking and <div class="bookquote">``taking something''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>should be less imperiously needed as a
means of getting a decent status in company and debate. Mordecai was
received with welcoming voices which had a slight cadence of compassion
in them, but naturally all glances passed immediately to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have brought a friend who is interested in our subjects,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said
Mordecai. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has traveled and studied much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the gentlemen anonymous? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a Great `Unknown?'''  (<font color='red'><b>Shelley</b></font>)</div>said the
broad-chested quoter of Shelley, with a humorous air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Daniel Deronda. I am unknown, but not in any sense great.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>The smile breaking over the stranger's grave face as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said this was
so agreeable that there was a general indistinct murmur, equivalent to
a <div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the broad man said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You recommend the name, sir, and are welcome. Here, Mordecai, come to
this corner against me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, evidently wishing to give the
coziest place to the one who most needed it.

<p/>Deronda was well satisfied to get a seat on the opposite side, where
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) general survey of the party easily included Mordecai, who remained
an eminently striking object in this group of sharply-characterized
figures, more than one of whom, even to Daniel's little exercised
discrimination, seemed probably of Jewish descent.

<p/>In fact pure English blood -LRB-if leech or lancet can furnish us with the
precise product-RRB- did not declare itself predominantly in the party at
present assembled. Miller, the broad man, an exceptional second-hand
bookseller who knew the insides of books, had at least grand-parents
who called themselves German, and possibly far-away ancestors who
denied themselves to be Jews; Buchan, the saddler, was Scotch; Pash,
the watchmaker, was a small, dark, vivacious, triple-baked Jew; Gideon,
the optical instrument maker, was a Jew of the red-haired,
generous-featured type easily passing for Englishmen of unusually
cordial manners: and Croop, the dark-eyed shoemaker, was probably more
Celtic than he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) knew. Only three would have been discernable everywhere
as Englishman: the wood-inlayer Goodwin, well-built, open-faced,
pleasant-voiced; the florid laboratory assistant Marrables; and Lily,
the pale, neat-faced copying-clerk, whose light-brown hair was set up
in a small parallelogram above his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) well-filled forehead, and whose
shirt, taken with an otherwise seedy costume, had a freshness that
might be called insular, and perhaps even something narrower.

<p/>Certainly a company select of the select among poor men, being drawn
together by a taste not prevalent even among the privileged heirs of
learning and its institutions; and not likely to amuse any gentleman in
search of crime or low comedy as the ground of interest in people whose
weekly income is only divisible into shillings. Deronda, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had
not been more than usually inclined to gravity under the influence of
what was pending between him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and Mordecai, would not have set himself
to find food for laughter in the various shades of departure from the
tone of polished society sure to be observable in the air and talk of
these men who had probably snatched knowledge as most of us snatch
indulgences, making the utmost of scant opportunity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) looked around
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) with the quiet air of respect habitual to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) among equals, ordered
whisky and water, and offered the contents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) cigar-case, which,
characteristically enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) always carried and hardly ever used for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own behoof, having reasons for not smoking himself, but liking to
indulge others. Perhaps it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) weakness to be afraid of seeming
straight-laced, and turning himself into a sort of diagram instead of a
growth which can exercise the guiding attraction of fellowship. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
made a decidedly winning impression on the company was proved by their
showing themselves no less at ease than before, and desirous of quickly
resuming their interrupted talk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is what I call one of our touch-and-go nights, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miller,
who was implicitly accepted as a sort of moderator--on addressing
Deronda by way of explanation, and nodding toward each person whose
name he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mentioned. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes we stick pretty close to the point. But
tonight our friend Pash, there, brought up the law of progress; and we
got on statistics; then Lily, there, saying we knew well enough before
counting that in the same state of society the same sort of things
would happen, and it was no more wonder that quantities should remain
the same, than that qualities should remain the same, for in relation
to society numbers are qualities--the number of drunkards is a quality
in society--the numbers are an index to the qualities, and give us no
instruction, only setting us to consider the causes of difference
between different social states--Lily saying this, we went off on the
causes of social change, and when you came in I was going upon the
power of ideas, which I hold to be the main transforming cause.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't hold with you there, Miller,''  (<font color='red'><b>Goodwin</b></font>)</div>said Goodwin, the inlayer, more
concerned to carry on the subject than to wait for a word from the new
guest. <div class="bookquote">``For either you mean so many sorts of things by ideas that I get
no knowledge by what you say, any more than if you said light was a
cause; or else you mean a particular sort of ideas, and then I go
against your meaning as too narrow. For, look at it in one way, all
actions men put a bit of thought into are ideas--say, sowing seed, or
making a canoe, or baking clay; and such ideas as these work themselves
into life and go on growing with it, but they can't go apart from the
material that set them to work and makes a medium for them. It's the
nature of wood and stone yielding to the knife that raises the idea of
shaping them, and with plenty of wood and stone the shaping will go on.
I look at it, that such ideas as are mixed straight away with all the
other elements of life are powerful along with 'em. The slower the
mixing, the less power they have. And as to the causes of social
change, I look at it in this way--ideas are a sort of parliament, but
there's a commonwealth outside and a good deal of the commonwealth is
working at change without knowing what the parliament is doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you take ready mixing as your test of power,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div>said Pash, <div class="bookquote">``some
of the least practical ideas beat everything. They spread without being
understood, and enter into the language without being thought of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They may act by changing the distribution of gases,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Marrables;
<div class="bookquote">``instruments are getting so fine now, men may come to register the
spread of a theory by observed changes in the atmosphere and
corresponding changes in the nerves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div>said Pash, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pash</b></font>) dark face lighting up rather impishly, <div class="bookquote">``there is
the idea of nationalities; I dare say the wild asses are snuffing it,
and getting more gregarious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't share that idea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, finding a piquant
incongruity between Pash's sarcasm and the strong stamp of race on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pash</b></font>)
features.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, rather, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) does not share that spirit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, who had
turned a melancholy glance on Pash. <div class="bookquote">``Unless nationality is a feeling,
what force can it have as an idea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Granted, Mordecai,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div>said Pash, quite good-humoredly. <div class="bookquote">``And as the
feeling of nationality is dying, I take the idea to be no better than a
ghost, already walking to announce the death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sentiment may seem to be dying and yet revive into strong life,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``Nations have revived. We may live to see a great
outburst of force in the Arabs, who are being inspired with a new zeal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen, amen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, looking at Deronda with a delight which
was the beginning of recovered energy: his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) attitude was more upright,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) face was less worn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That may hold with backward nations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div>said Pash, <div class="bookquote">``but with us in
Europe the sentiment of nationality is destined to die out. It will
last a little longer in the quarters where oppression lasts, but
nowhere else. The whole current of progress is setting against it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Buchan</b></font>)</div>said Buchan, in a rapid thin Scotch tone which was like the
letting in of a little cool air on the conversation, <div class="bookquote">``ye've done well
to bring us round to the point. Ye're all agreed that societies
change--not always and everywhere--but on the whole and in the long
run. Now, with all deference, I would beg t' observe that we have got
to examine the nature of changes before we have a warrant to call them
progress, which word is supposed to include a bettering, though I
apprehend it to be ill-chosen for that purpose, since mere motion
onward may carry us to a bog or a precipice. And the questions I would
put are three: Is all change in the direction of progress? if not, how
shall we discern which change is progress and which not? and thirdly,
how far and in what way can we act upon the course of change so as to
promote it where it is beneficial, and divert it where it is injurious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Scotch</b></font>)</div><p/>But Buchan's attempt to impose his (<font color='blue'><b>Pash</b></font>) method on the talk was a failure.
Lily immediately said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Change and progress are merged in the idea of development. The laws of
development are being discovered, and changes taking place according to
them are necessarily progressive; that is to say, it we have any notion
of progress or improvement opposed to them, the notion is a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really can't see how you arrive at that sort of certitude about
changes by calling them development,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``There will still
remain the degrees of inevitableness in relation to our own will and
acts, and the degrees of wisdom in hastening or retarding; there will
still remain the danger of mistaking a tendency which should be
resisted for an inevitable law that we must adjust ourselves to,--which
seems to me as bad a superstition or false god as any that has been set
up without the ceremonies of philosophising.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai. ``Woe to the men who see no place for
resistance in this generation! I believe in a growth, a passage, and a
new unfolding of life whereof the seed is more perfect, more charged
with the elements that are pregnant with diviner form. The life of a
people grows, it is knit together and yet expanded, in joy and sorrow,
in thought and action; it absorbs the thought of other nations into its
own forms, and gives back the thought as new wealth to the world; it is
a power and an organ in the great body of the nations. But there may
come a check, an arrest; memories may be stifled, and love may be faint
for the lack of them; or memories may shrink into withered relics--the
soul of a people, whereby they know themselves to be one, may seem to
be dying for want of common action. But who shall say, ``The fountain of
their life is dried up, they shall forever cease to be a nation?'' Who
shall say it? Not he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) who feels the life of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) people stirring within
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own. Shall he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) say, ``That way events are wending, I will not
resist?<div class="bookquote">'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) very soul is resistance, and is as a seed of fire that may
enkindle the souls of multitudes, and make a new pathway for events.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't deny patriotism,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gideon</b></font>)</div>said Gideon, <div class="bookquote">``but we all know you have a
particular meaning, Mordecai. You know Mordecai's way of thinking, I
suppose.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gideon</b></font>)</div>Here Gideon had turned to Deronda, who sat next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>), but
without waiting for an answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>) went on. ``I'm a rational Jew myself. I
stand by my people as a sort of family relations, and I am for keeping
up our worship in a rational way. I don't approve of our people getting
baptised, because I don't believe in a Jew's conversion to the Gentile
part of Christianity. And now we have political equality, there's no
excuse for a pretense of that sort. But I am for getting rid of all of
our superstitions and exclusiveness. There's no reason now why we
shouldn't melt gradually into the populations we live among. That's the
order of the day in point of progress. I would as soon my children
married Christians as Jews. And I'm for the old maxim, <div class="bookquote">``A man's country
is where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s well off.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That country's not so easy to find, Gideon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div>said the rapid Pash, with
a shrug and grimace. ``You get ten shillings a-week more than I do, and
have only half the number of children. If somebody will introduce a
brisk trade in watches among the ``Jerusalem wares,<div class="bookquote">'' I'll go--eh,
Mordecai, what do you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda, all ear for these hints of Mordecai's opinion, was inwardly
wondering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) persistence in coming to this club. For an
enthusiastic spirit to meet continually the fixed indifference of men
familiar with the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) enthusiasm is the acceptance of a slow
martyrdom, beside which the fate of a missionary tomahawked without any
considerate rejection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) doctrines seems hardly worthy of
compassion. But Mordecai gave no sign of shrinking: this was a moment
of spiritual fullness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) cared more for the utterance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) faith
than for its immediate reception. With a fervor which had no temper in
it, but seemed rather the rush of feeling in the opportunity of speech,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) answered Pash:--

<p/>``What I say is, let every man keep far away from the brotherhood and
inheritance he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) despises. Thousands on thousands of our race have mixed
with the Gentiles as Celt with Saxon, and they may inherit the blessing
that belongs to the Gentile. You cannot follow them. You are one of the
multitudes over this globe who must walk among the nations and be known
as Jews, and with words on their lips which mean, ``I wish I had not
been born a Jew, I disown any bond with the long travail of my race, I
will outdo the Gentile in mocking at our separateness,<div class="bookquote">'' they all the
while feel breathing on them the breath of contempt because they are
Jews, and they will breathe it back poisonously. Can a fresh-made
garment of citizenship weave itself straightway into the flesh and
change the slow deposit of eighteen centuries? What is the citizenship
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) who walks among a people he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) has no hardy kindred and fellowship
with, and has lost the sense of brotherhood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own race? It is a
charter of selfish ambition and rivalry in low greed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) is an alien of
spirit, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) may be in form; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) sucks the blood of mankind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
is not a man, sharing in no loves, sharing in no subjection of the
soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mocks it all. Is it not truth I speak, Pash?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Gentile</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly, Mordecai,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div>said Pash, <div class="bookquote">``if you mean that I think the worse
of myself for being a Jew. What I thank our fathers for is that there
are fewer blockheads among us than among other races. But perhaps you
are right in thinking the Christians don't like me so well for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catholics and Protestants have not liked each other much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gideon</b></font>)</div>said
the genial Gideon. <div class="bookquote">``We must wait patiently for prejudices to die out.
Many of our people are on a footing with the best, and there's been a
good filtering of our blood into high families. I am for making our
expectations rational.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so am I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, quickly, leaning forward with the
eagerness of one who pleads in some decisive crisis, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) long, thin
hands clasped together on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) lap. ``I, too, claim to be a rational Jew.
But what is it to be rational--what is it to feel the light of the
divine reason growing stronger within and without? It is to see more
and more of the hidden bonds that bind and consecrate change as a
dependent growth--yea, consecrate it with kinship: the past becomes my
parent and the future stretches toward me the appealing arms of
children. Is it rational to drain away the sap of special kindred that
makes the families of men rich in interchanged wealth, and various as
the forests are various with the glory of the cedar and the palm? When
it is rational to say, ``I know not my father or my mother, let my
children be aliens to me, that no prayer of mine may touch them,'' then
it will be rational for the Jew to say, <div class="bookquote">``I will seek to know no
difference between me and the Gentile, I will not cherish the prophetic
consciousness of our nationality--let the Hebrew cease to be, and let
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) memorials be antiquarian trifles, dead as the wall-paintings of
a conjectured race. Yet let his (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) child learn by rote the speech of the
Greek, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) abjures his (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) fellow-citizens by the bravery of those who
fought foremost at Marathon--let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) learn to say that was noble in the
Greek, that is the spirit of an immortal nation! But the Jew has no
memories that bind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) to action; let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) laugh that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) nation is
degraded from a nation; let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hold the monuments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) law which
carried within its frame the breath of social justice, of charity, and
of household sanctities--let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hold the energy of the prophets, the
patient care of the Masters, the fortitude of martyred generations, as
mere stuff for a professorship. The business of the Jew in all things
is to be even as the rich Gentile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai threw himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) chair, and there was a moment's
silence. Not one member of the club shared his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) point of view or his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
emotion; but his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) whole personality and speech had on them the effect of
a dramatic representation which had some pathos in it, though no
practical consequences; and usually he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was at once indulged and
contradicted. Deronda's mind went back upon what must have been the
tragic pressure of outward conditions hindering this man, whose force
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt to be telling on himself, from making any world for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought
in the minds of others--like a poet among people of a strange speech,
who may have a poetry of their own, but have no ear for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cadence, no
answering thrill to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discovery of the latent virtues in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother
tongue.

<p/>The cool Buchan was the first to speak, and hint the loss of time. <div class="bookquote">``I
submit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that ye're traveling away from the questions I put
concerning progress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say they're levanting, Buchan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miller, who liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) joke, and
would not have objected to be called Voltairian. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind. Let us
have a Jewish night; we've not had one for a long while. Let us take
the discussion on Jewish ground. I suppose we've no prejudice here;
we're all philosophers; and we like our friends Mordecai, Pash, and
Gideon, as well as if they were no more kin to Abraham than the rest of
us. We're all related through Adam, until further showing to the
contrary, and if you look into history we've all got some discreditable
forefathers. So I mean no offence when I say I don't think any great
things of the part the Jewish people have played in the world. What
then? I think they were iniquitously dealt by in past times. And I
suppose we don't want any men to be maltreated, white, black, brown, or
yellow--I know I've just given my half-crown to the contrary. And that
reminds me, I've a curious old German book--I can't read it myself, but
a friend of mine was reading out of it to me the other day--about the
prejudicies against the Jews, and the stories used to be told against
'em, and what do you think one was? Why, that they're punished with a
bad odor in their bodies; and _that_, says the author, date 1715 -LRB-I've
just been pricing and marking the book this very morning-RRB---that is
true, for the ancients spoke of it. But then, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) says, the other things
are fables, such as that the odor goes away all at once when they're
baptized, and that every one of the ten tribes, mind you, all the ten
being concerned in the crucifixion, has got a particular punishment
over and above the smell:--Asher, I remember, has the right arm a
handbreadth shorter than the left, and Naphthali has pig's ears and a
smell of live pork. What do you think of that? There's been a good deal
of fun made of rabbinical fables, but in point of fables my opinion is,
that all over the world it's six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.
However, as I said before, I hold with the philosophers of the last
century that the Jews have played no great part as a people, though
Pash will have it they're clever enough to beat all the rest of the
world. But if so, I ask, why haven't they done it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the same reason that the cleverest men in the country don't get
themselves or their ideas into Parliament,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div>said the ready Pash;
<div class="bookquote">``because the blockheads are too many for 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a vain question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, <div class="bookquote">``whether our people would
beat the rest of the world. Each nation has its own work, and is a
member of the world, enriched by the work of each. But it is true, as
Jehuda-ha-Levi first said, that Israel is the heart of mankind, if we
mean by heart the core of affection which binds a race and its families
in dutiful love, and the reverence for the human body which lifts the
needs of our animal life into religion, and the tenderness which is
merciful to the poor and weak and to the dumb creature that wears the
yoke for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're not behind any nation in arrogance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div>said Lily; <div class="bookquote">``and if they
have got in the rear, it has not been because they were over-modest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, every nation brags in its turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div>said Pash, <div class="bookquote">``and some of them in the Hebrew text.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, whatever the Jews contributed at one time, they are a
stand-still people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div>said Lily. <div class="bookquote">``They are the type of obstinate
adherence to the superannuated. They may show good abilities when they
take up liberal ideas, but as a race they have no development in them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is false!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, leaning forward again with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pash</b></font>) former
eagerness. ``Let their history be known and examined; let the seed be
sifted, let its beginning be traced to the weed of the wilderness--the
more glorious will be the energy that transformed it. Where else is
there a nation of whom it may be as truly said that their religion and
law and moral life mingled as the stream of blood in the heart and made
one growth--where else a people who kept and enlarged their spiritual
store at the very time when they are hated with a hatred as fierce as
the forest fires that chase the wild beast from his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) covert? There is a
fable of the Roman, that swimming to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) held the roll of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) writings between his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) teeth and saved them from the waters. But how
much more than that is true of our race? They struggled to keep their
place among the nations like heroes--yea, when the hand was hacked off,
they clung with their teeth; but when the plow and the harrow had
passed over the last visible signs of their national covenant, and the
fruitfulness of their land was stifled with the blood of the sowers and
planters, they said, ``The spirit is alive, let us make it a lasting
habitation--lasting because movable--so that it may be carried from
generation to generation, and our sons unborn may be rich in the things
that have been, and possess a hope built on an unchangeable
foundation.'' They said it and they wrought it, though often breathing
with scant life, as in a coffin, or as lying wounded amid a heap of
slain. Hooted and scared like the unknown dog, the Hebrew made himself
envied for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pash</b></font>) wealth and wisdom, and was bled of them to fill the bath
of Gentile luxury; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) absorbed knowledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) diffused it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) dispersed
race was a new Phoenicia working the mines of Greece and carrying their
products to the world. The native spirit of our tradition was not to
stand still, but to use records as a seed and draw out the compressed
virtues of law and prophecy; and while the Gentile, who had said, ``What
is yours is ours, and no longer yours,<div class="bookquote">'' was reading the letter of our
law as a dark inscription, or was turning its parchments into
shoe-soles for an army rabid with lust and cruelty, our Masters were
still enlarging and illuminating with fresh-fed interpretation. But the
dispersion was wide, the yoke of oppression was a spiked torture as
well as a load; the exile was forced afar among brutish people, where
the consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) race was no clearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) than the light of
the sun to our fathers in the Roman persecution, who had their
hiding-place in a cave, and knew not that it was day save by the dimmer
burning of their candles. What wonder that multitudes of our people are
ignorant, narrow, superstitious? What wonder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mordecai, whose seat was next the fireplace, rose and leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
arm on the little shelf; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) excitement had risen, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) voice,
which had begun with unusual strength, was getting hoarser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What wonder? The night is unto them, that they have no vision; in
their darkness they are unable to divine; the sun is gone down over the
prophets, and the day is dark above them; their observances are as
nameless relics. But which among the chief of the Gentile nations has
not an ignorant multitude? They scorn our people's ignorant observance;
but the most accursed ignorance is that which has no observance--sunk
to the cunning greed of the fox, to which all law is no more than a
trap or the cry of the worrying hound. There is a degradation deep down
below the memory that has withered into superstition. In the multitudes
of the ignorant on three continents who observe our rites and make the
confession of the divine Unity, the soul of Judaism is not dead. Revive
the organic centre: let the unity of Israel which has made the growth
and form of its religion be an outward reality. Looking toward a land
and a polity, our dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may
share the dignity of a national life which has a voice among the
peoples of the East and the West--which will plant the wisdom and skill
of our race so that it may be, as of old, a medium of transmission and
understanding. Let that come to pass, and the living warmth will spread
to the weak extremities of Israel, and superstition will vanish, not in
the lawlessness of the renegade, but in the illumination of great facts
which widen feeling, and make all knowledge alive as the young
offspring of beloved memories.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai's voice had sunk, but with the hectic brilliancy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) gaze
it was not the less impressive. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) extraordinary excitement was
certainly due to Deronda's presence: it was to Deronda that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
speaking, and the moment had a testamentary solemnity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) which
rallied all his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) powers. Yet the presence of those other familiar men
promoted expression, for they embodied the indifference which gave a
resistant energy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) speech. Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked at Deronda: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
seemed to see nothing immediately around him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and if any one had
grasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would probably not have known it. Again the former words
came back to Deronda's mind,--<div class="bookquote">``You must hope my hopes--see the vision I
point to--behold a glory where I behold it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>They came now with
gathered pathos. Before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) stood, as a living, suffering reality, what
hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had only seen as an effort of imagination, which, in its
comparative faintness, yet carried a suspicion, of being exaggerated: a
man steeped in poverty and obscurity, weakened by disease, consciously
within the shadow of advancing death, but living an intense life in an
invisible past and future, careless of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal lot, except for its
possible making some obstruction to a conceived good which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
never share except as a brief inward vision--a day afar off, whose sun
would never warm him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but into which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul's desire, with a
passion often wanting to the personal motives of healthy youth. It was
something more than a grandiose transfiguration of the parental love
that toils, renounces, endures, resists the suicidal promptings of
despair--all because of the little ones, whose future becomes present
to the yearning gaze of anxiety.

<p/>All eyes were fixed on Mordecai as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) sat down again, and none with
unkindness; but it happened that the one who felt the most kindly was
the most prompted to speak in opposition. This was the genial and
rational Gideon, who also was not without a sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>) was
addressing the guest of the evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have your own way of looking at things, Mordecai, and as you say,
your own way seems to you rational. I know you don't hold with the
restoration of Judea by miracle, and so on; but you are as well aware
as I am that the subject has been mixed with a heap of nonsense both by
Jews and Christians. And as to the connection of our race with
Palestine, it has been perverted by superstition till it's as
demoralizing as the old poor-law. The raff and scum go there to be
maintained like able-bodied paupers, and to be taken special care of by
the angel Gabriel when they die. It's no use fighting against facts. We
must look where they point; that's what I call rationality. The most
learned and liberal men among us who are attached to our religion are
for clearing our liturgy of all such notions as a literal fulfillment
of the prophecies about restoration, and so on. Prune it of a few
useless rites and literal interpretations of that sort, and our
religion is the simplest of all religions, and makes no barrier, but a
union, between us and the rest of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As plain as a pike-staff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div>said Pash, with an ironical laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You
pluck it up by the roots, strip off the leaves and bark, shave off the
knots, and smooth it at top and bottom; put it where you will, it will
do no harm, it will never sprout. You may make a handle of it, or you
may throw it on the bonfire of scoured rubbish. I don't see why our
rubbish is to be held sacred any more than the rubbish of Brahmanism or
Buddhism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, <div class="bookquote">``no, Pash, because you have lost the heart of the
Jew. Community was felt before it was called good. I praise no
superstition, I praise the living fountains of enlarging belief. What
is growth, completion, development? You began with that question, I
apply it to the history of our people. I say that the effect of our
separateness will not be completed and have its highest transformation
unless our race takes on again the character of a nationality. That is
the fulfillment of the religious trust that moulded them into a people,
whose life has made half the inspiration of the world. What is it to me
that the ten tribes are lost untraceably, or that multitudes of the
children of Judah have mixed themselves with the Gentile populations as
a river with rivers? Behold our people still! Their skirts spread afar;
they are torn and soiled and trodden on; but there is a jeweled
breastplate. Let the wealthy men, the monarchs of commerce, the learned
in all knowledge, the skilful in all arts, the speakers, the political
counselors, who carry in their veins the Hebrew blood which has
maintained its vigor in all climates, and the pliancy of the Hebrew
genius for which difficulty means new device--let them say, `we will
lift up a standard, we will unite in a labor hard but glorious like
that of Moses and Ezra, a labor which shall be a worthy fruit of the
long anguish whereby our fathers maintained their separateness,
refusing the ease of falsehood.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>They have wealth enough to redeem the
soil from debauched and paupered conquerors; they have the skill of the
statesman to devise, the tongue of the orator to persuade. And is there
no prophet or poet among us to make the ears of Christian Europe tingle
with shame at the hideous obloquy of Christian strife which the Turk
gazes at as at the fighting of beasts to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) has lent an arena?
There is store of wisdom among us to found a new Jewish polity, grand,
simple, just, like the old--a republic where there is equality of
protection, an equality which shone like a star on the forehead of our
ancient community, and gave it more than the brightness of Western
freedom amid the despotisms of the East. Then our race shall have an
organic centre, a heart and brain to watch and guide and execute; the
outraged Jew shall have a defense in the court of nations, as the
outraged Englishman of America. And the world will gain as Israel
gains. For there will be a community in the van of the East which
carries the culture and the sympathies of every great nation in its
bosom: there will be a land set for a halting-place of enmities, a
neutral ground for the East as Belgium is for the West. Difficulties? I
know there are difficulties. But let the spirit of sublime achievement
move in the great among our people, and the work will begin.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, we may safely admit that, Mordecai,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pash</b></font>)</div>said Pash. ``When there are
great men on <div class="bookquote">``Change, and high-flying professors converted to your
doctrine, difficulties will vanish like smoke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda, inclined by nature to take the side of those on whom the
arrows of scorn were falling, could not help replying to Pash's
outfling, and said--

<p/>``If we look back to the history of efforts which have made great
changes, it is astonishing how many of them seemed hopeless to those
who looked on in the beginning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take what we have all heard and seen something of--the effort after
the unity of Italy, which we are sure soon to see accomplished to the
very last boundary. Look into Mazzini's account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) first yearning,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was a boy, after a restored greatness and a new freedom to
Italy, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) first efforts as a young man to rouse the same
feelings in other young men, and get them to work toward a united
nationality. Almost everything seemed against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) countrymen were
ignorant or indifferent, governments hostile, Europe incredulous. Of
course the scorners often seemed wise. Yet you see the prophecy lay
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). As long as there is a remnant of national consciousness, I
suppose nobody will deny that there may be a new stirring of memories
and hopes which may inspire arduous action.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, to whom Deronda's words were a cordial. ``What is
needed is the leaven--what is needed is the seed of fire. The heritage
of Israel is beating in the pulses of millions; it lives in their veins
as a power without understanding, like the morning exultation of herds;
it is the inborn half of memory, moving as in a dream among writings on
the walls, which it sees dimly but cannot divide into speech. Let the
torch of visible community be lit! Let the reason of Israel disclose
itself in a great outward deed, and let there be another great
migration, another choosing of Israel to be a nationality whose members
may still stretch to the ends of the earth, even as the sons of England
and Germany, whom enterprise carries afar, but who still have a
national hearth and a tribunal of national opinion. Will any say ``It
cannot be'? Baruch Spinoza had not a faithful Jewish heart, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Spinoza</b></font>)
had sucked the life of his (<font color='blue'><b>Spinoza</b></font>) intellect at the breasts of Jewish
tradition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spinoza</b></font>) laid bare his (<font color='blue'><b>Spinoza</b></font>) father's nakedness and said, <div class="bookquote">``They who
scorn him (<font color='blue'><b>Spinoza</b></font>) have the higher wisdom.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Yet Baruch Spinoza confessed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Spinoza</b></font>) saw
not why Israel should not again be a chosen nation. Who says that the
history and literature of our race are dead? Are they not as living as
the history and literature of Greece and Rome, which have inspired
revolutions, enkindled the thought of Europe, and made the unrighteous
powers tremble? These were an inheritance dug from the tomb. Ours is an
inheritance that has never ceased to quiver in millions of human
frames.''

<p/>Mordecai had stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) arms upward, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) long thin hands
quivered in the air for a moment after he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had ceased to speak. Gideon
was certainly a little moved, for though there was no long pause before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>) made a remark in objection, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>) tone was more mild and deprecatory
than before; Pash, meanwhile, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pash</b></font>) lips together, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pash</b></font>)
black head with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Pash</b></font>) hands and wrinkling his (<font color='blue'><b>Pash</b></font>) brow horizontally,
with the expression of one who differs from every speaker, but does not
think it worth while to say so. There is a sort of human paste that
when it comes near the fire of enthusiasm is only baked into harder
shape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may seem well enough on one side to make so much of our memories
and inheritance as you do, Mordecai,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gideon</b></font>)</div>said Gideon; <div class="bookquote">``but there's another
side. It isn't all gratitude and harmless glory. Our people have
inherited a good deal of hatred. There's a pretty lot of curses still
flying about, and stiff settled rancor inherited from the times of
persecution. How will you justify keeping one sort of memory and
throwing away the other? There are ugly debts standing on both sides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gideon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I justify the choice as all other choice is justified,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai.
``I cherish nothing for the Jewish nation, I seek nothing for them, but
the good which promises good to all the nations. The spirit of our
religious life, which is one with our national life, is not hatred of
aught but wrong. The Master has said, an offence against man is worse
than an offence against God. But what wonder if there is hatred in the
breasts of Jews, who are children of the ignorant and oppressed--what
wonder, since there is hatred in the breasts of Christians? Our
national life was a growing light. Let the central fire be kindled
again, and the light will reach afar. The degraded and scorned of our
race will learn to think of their sacred land, not as a place for
saintly beggary to await death in loathsome idleness, but as a republic
where the Jewish spirit manifests itself in a new order founded on the
old, purified and enriched by the experience our greatest sons have
gathered from the life of the ages. How long is it?--only two centuries
since a vessel carried over the ocean the beginning of the great North
American nation. The people grew like meeting waters--they were various
in habit and sect--there came a time, a century ago, when they needed a
polity, and there were heroes of peace among them. What had they to
form a polity with but memories of Europe, corrected by the vision of a
better? Let our wise and wealthy show themselves heroes. They have the
memories of the East and West, and they have the full vision of a
better. A new Persia with a purified religion magnified itself in art
and wisdom. So will a new Judaea, poised between East and West--a
covenant of reconciliation. Will any say, the prophetic vision of your
race has been hopelessly mixed with folly and bigotry: the angel of
progress has no message for Judaism--it is a half-buried city for the
paid workers to lay open--the waters are rushing by it as a forsaken
field? I say that the strongest principle of growth lies in human
choice. The sons of Judah have to choose that God may again choose
them. The Messianic time is the time when Israel shall will the
planting of the national ensign. The Nile overflowed and rushed onward:
the Egyptian could not choose the overflow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>ensign</b></font>) chose to work and
make channels for the fructifying waters, and Egypt became the land of
corn. Shall man, whose soul is set in the royalty of discernment and
resolve, deny his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rank and say, I am an onlooker, ask no choice or
purpose of me? That is the blasphemy of this time. The divine principle
of our race is action, choice, resolved memory. Let us contradict the
blasphemy, and help to will our own better future and the better future
of the world--not renounce our higher gift and say, <div class="bookquote">``Let us be as if we
were not among the populations;' but choose our full heritage, claim
the brotherhood of our nation, and carry into it a new brotherhood with
the nations of the Gentiles. The vision is there; it will be fulfilled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>With the last sentence, which was no more than a loud whisper, Mordecai
let his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) chin sink on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) breast and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) eyelids fall. No one spoke. It
was not the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had insisted on the same ideas, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
was seen to-night in a new phase. The quiet tenacity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) ordinary
self differed as much from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) present exaltation of mood as a man in
private talk, giving reasons for a revolution of which no sign is
discernable, differs from one who feels himself an agent in a
revolution begun. The dawn of fulfillment brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) hope by
Deronda's presence had wrought Mordecai's conception into a state of
impassioned conviction, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had found strength in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) excitement to
pour forth the unlocked floods of emotive argument, with a sense of
haste as at a crisis which must be seized. But now there had come with
the quiescence of fatigue a sort of thankful wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had
spoken--a contemplation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) life as a journey which had come at last
to this bourne. After a great excitement, the ebbing strength of
impulse is apt to leave us in this aloofness from our active self. And
in the moments after Mordecai had sunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) head, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind was wandering
along the paths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) youth, and all the hopes which had ended in
bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hither.

<p/>Every one felt that the talk was ended, and the tone of phlegmatic
discussion made unseasonable by Mordecai's high-pitched solemnity. It
was as if they had come together to hear the blowing of the _shophar_,
and had nothing to do now but to disperse. The movement was unusually
general, and in less than ten minutes the room was empty of all except
Mordecai and Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``Good-nights''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>had been given to Mordecai, but it
was evident he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had not heard them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) remained rapt and motionless.
Deronda would not disturb this needful rest, but waited for a
spontaneous movement.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My spirit is too weak; mortality
Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
And each imagined pinnacle and steep
Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--KEATS.


<p/>After a few minutes the unwonted stillness had penetrated Mordecai's
consciousness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) looked up at Deronda, not in the least with
bewilderment and surprise, but with a gaze full of reposing
satisfaction. Deronda rose and placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) chair nearer, where there
could be no imagined need for raising the voice. Mordecai felt the
action as a patient feels the gentleness that eases his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) pillow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
began to speak in a low tone, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) were only thinking articulately,
not trying to reach an audience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the doctrine of the Cabbala, souls are born again and again in new
bodies till they are perfected and purified, and a soul liberated from
a worn-out body may join the fellow-soul that needs it, that they may
be perfected together, and their earthly work accomplished. Then they
will depart from the mortal region, and leave place for new souls to be
born out of the store in the eternal bosom. It is the lingering
imperfection of the souls already born into the mortal region that
hinders the birth of new souls and the preparation of the Messianic
time:--thus the mind has given shape to what is hidden, as the shadow
of what is known, and has spoken truth, though it were only in parable.
When my long-wandering soul is liberated from this weary body, it will
join yours, and its work will be perfected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai's pause seemed an appeal which Deronda's feeling would not let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) leave unanswered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tried to make it truthful; but for Mordecai's
ear it was inevitably filled with unspoken meaning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) only said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything I can in conscience do to make your life effective I will
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, in a tone of quiet certainty which
dispenses with further assurance. <div class="bookquote">``I heard it. You see it all--you are
by my side on the mount of vision, and behold the paths of fulfillment
which others deny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was silent a moment or two, and then went on meditatively--

<p/>``You will take up my life where it was broken. I feel myself back in
that day when my life was broken. The bright morning sun was on the
quay--it was at Trieste--the garments of men from all nations shone
like jewels--the boats were pushing off--the Greek vessel that would
land us at Beyrout was to start in an hour. I was going with a merchant
as his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) clerk and companion. I said, I shall behold the lands and people
of the East, and I shall speak with a fuller vision. I breathed then as
you do, without labor; I had the light step and the endurance of youth,
I could fast, I could sleep on the hard ground. I had wedded poverty,
and I loved my bride--for poverty to me was freedom. My heart exulted
as if it had been the heart of Moses ben Maimon, strong with the
strength of three score years, and knowing the work that was to fill
them. It was the first time I had been south; the soul within me felt
its former sun; and standing on the quay, where the ground I stood on
seemed to send forth light, and the shadows had an azure glory as of
spirits become visible, I felt myself in the flood of a glorious life,
wherein my own small year-counted existence seemed to melt, so that I
knew it not; and a great sob arose within me as at the rush of waters
that were too strong a bliss. So I stood there awaiting my companion;
and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) not till he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Ezra, I have been to the post and
there is your letter.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ezra!''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Deronda, unable to contain himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ezra,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>repeated Mordecai, affirmatively, engrossed in memory. ``I was
expecting a letter; for I wrote continually to my mother. And that
sound of my name was like the touch of a wand that recalled me to the
body wherefrom I had been released as it were to mingle with the ocean
of human existence, free from the pressure of individual bondage. I
opened the letter; and the name came again as a cry that would have
disturbed me in the bosom of heaven, and made me yearn to reach where
that sorrow was--<div class="bookquote">``Ezra, my son!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai paused again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) imagination arrested by the grasp of that
long-passed moment. Deronda's mind was almost breathlessly suspended on
what was coming. A strange possibility had suddenly presented itself.
Mordecai's eyes were cast down in abstracted contemplation, and in a
few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) went on--

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a mother of whom it might have come--yea, might have come to
be said, ``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children arise up and call her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) blessed.'' In her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) I
understood the meaning of that Master who, perceiving the footsteps of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) mother, rose up and said, ``The Majesty of the Eternal cometh near!''
And that letter was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cry from the depths of anguish and
desolation--the cry of a mother robbed of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little ones. I was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
eldest. Death had taken four babes one after the other. Then came,
late, my little sister, who was, more than all the rest, the desire of
my mother's eyes; and the letter was a piercing cry to me--``Ezra, my
son, I am robbed of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) has taken her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) away and left disgrace
behind. They will never come again.'''--Here Mordecai lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) eyes
suddenly, laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hand on Deronda's arm, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Mine was the lot
of Israel. For the sin of the father my soul must go into exile. For
the sin of the father the work was broken, and the day of fulfilment
delayed. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) who bore me was desolate, disgraced, destitute. I turned
back. On the instant I turned--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spirit and the spirit of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
fathers, who had worthy Jewish hearts, moved within me, and drew me.
God, in whom dwells the universe, was within me as the strength of
obedience. I turned and traveled with hardship--to save the scant money
which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would need. I left the sunshine, and traveled into freezing
cold. In the last stage I spent a night in exposure to cold and snow.
And that was the beginning of this slow death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai let his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) eyes wander again and removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hand. Deronda
resolutely repressed the questions which urged themselves within him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).
While Mordecai was in this state of emotion, no other confidence must
be sought than what came spontaneously: nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) himself felt a kindred
emotion which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) dread his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own speech as too momentous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I worked. We were destitute--every thing had been seized. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was ill: the clutch of anguish was too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and wrought with
some lurking disease. At times she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not stand for the beating of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart, and the images in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brain became as chambers of terror,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beheld my sister reared in evil. In the dead of night I heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) crying for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child. Then I rose, and we stretched forth our arms
together and prayed. We poured forth our souls in desire that Mirah
might be delivered from evil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mirah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda repeated, wishing to assure, himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ears had
not been deceived by a forecasting imagination. <div class="bookquote">``Did you say Mirah?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was my little sister's name. After we had prayed for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), my
mother would rest awhile. It lasted hardly four years, and in the
minute before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died, we were praying the same prayer--I aloud, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
silently. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soul went out upon its wings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you never since heard of your sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, as quietly
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never. Never have I heard whether she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was delivered according to our
prayer. I know not, I know not. Who shall say where the pathways lie?
The poisonous will of the wicked is strong. It poisoned my life--it is
slowly stifling this breath. Death delivered my mother, and I felt it a
blessedness that I was alone in the winters of suffering. But what are
the winters now?--they are far off'' (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>--here Mordecai again rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
hand on Deronda's arm, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) with that joy of the hectic
patient which pierces us to sadness--<div class="bookquote">``there is nothing to wail in the
withering of my body. The work will be the better done. Once I said the
work of this beginning was mine, I am born to do it. Well, I shall do
it. I shall live in you. I shall live in you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) grasp had become convulsive in its force, and Deronda, agitated as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had never been before--the certainty that this was Mirah's brother
suffusing his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own strange relation to Mordecai with a new solemnity and
tenderness--felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) strong young heart beating faster and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) lips
paling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) shrank from speech. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) feared, in Mordecai's present state
of exaltation -LRB-already an alarming strain on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) feeble frame-RRB-, to
utter a word of revelation about Mirah. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) feared to make an answer
below that high pitch of expectation which resembled a flash from a
dying fire, making watchers fear to see it die the faster. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) dominant
impulse was to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had once done before: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) firm, gentle
hand on the hand that grasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). Mordecai's, as if it had a soul of
its own--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was not distinctly willing to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) did--relaxed
its grasp, and turned upward under Deronda's. As the two palms met and
pressed each other Mordecai recovered some sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) surroundings,
and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go now. I cannot talk any longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>And in fact they parted at Cohen's door without having spoken to each
other again--merely with another pressure of the hands.

<p/>Deronda felt a weight on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) which was half joy, half anxiety. The joy
of finding in Mirah's brother a nature even more than worthy of that
relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>), had the weight of solemnity and sadness; the reunion
of brother and sister was in reality the first stage of a supreme
parting--like that farewell kiss which resembles greeting, that last
glance of love which becomes the sharpest pang of sorrow. Then there
was the weight of anxiety about the revelation of the fact on both
sides, and the arrangements it would be desirable to make beforehand. I
suppose we should all have felt as Deronda did, without sinking into
snobbishness or the notion that the primal duties of life demand a
morning and an evening suit, that it was an admissible desire to free
Mirah's first meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) brother from all jarring outward
conditions. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own sense of deliverance from the dreaded relationship
of the other Cohens, notwithstanding their good nature, made him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
resolve if possible to keep them in the background for Mirah, until her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
acquaintance with them would be an unmarred rendering of gratitude for
any kindness they had shown to her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) brother. On all accounts he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wished
to give Mordecai surroundings not only more suited to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) frail bodily
condition, but less of a hindrance to easy intercourse, even apart from
the decisive prospect of Mirah's taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) abode with her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) brother,
and tending him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) through the precious remnant of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life. In the heroic
drama, great recognitions are not encumbered with these details; and
certainly Deronda had as reverential an interest in Mordecai and Mirah
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) could have had in the offspring of Agamemnon; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) was caring
for destinies still moving in the dim streets of our earthly life, not
yet lifted among the constellations, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) task presented itself to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) as difficult and delicate, especially in persuading Mordecai to
change his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) abode and habits. Concerning Mirah's feeling and resolve he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
had no doubt: there would be a complete union of sentiment toward the
departed mother, and Mirah would understand her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother's greatness.
Yes, greatness: that was the word which Deronda now deliberately chose
to signify the impression that Mordecai had made on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) said to
himself, perhaps rather defiantly toward the more negative spirit
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), that this man, however erratic some of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interpretations
might be--this consumptive Jewish workman in threadbare clothing,
lodged by charity, delivering himself to hearers who took his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) thoughts
without attaching more consequences to them than the Flemings to the
ethereal chimes ringing above their market-places--had the chief
elements of greatness; a mind consciously, energetically moving with
the larger march of human destinies, but not the less full of
conscience and tender heart for the footsteps that tread near and need
a leaning-place; capable of conceiving and choosing a life's task with
far-off issues, yet capable of the unapplauded heroism which turns off
the road of achievement at the call of the nearer duty whose effect
lies within the beatings of the hearts that are close to us, as the
hunger of the unfledged bird to the breast of its parent.

<p/>Deronda to-night was stirred with, the feeling that the brief remnant
of this fervid life had become his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) charge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been peculiarly
wrought on by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had seen at the club of the friendly indifference
which Mordecai must have gone on encountering. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own experience of
the small room that ardor can make for itself in ordinary minds had had
the effect of increasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) reserve; and while tolerance was the
easiest attitude to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), there was another bent in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) also capable of
becoming a weakness--the dislike to appear exceptional or to risk an
ineffective insistance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own opinion. But such caution appeared
contemptible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) just now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), for the first time, saw in a
complete picture and felt as a reality the lives that burn themselves
out in solitary enthusiasm: martyrs of obscure circumstance, exiled in
the rarity of their own minds, whose deliverances in other ears are no
more than a long passionate soliloquy--unless perhaps at last, when
they are nearing the invisible shores, signs of recognition and
fulfilment may penetrate the cloud of loneliness; or perhaps it may be
with them as with the dying Copernicus made to touch the first printed
copy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Copernicus</b></font>) book when the sense of touch was gone, seeing it only as a
dim object through the deepening dusk.

<p/>Deronda had been brought near to one of those spiritual exiles, and it
was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) nature to feel the relation as a strong chain, nay, to feel
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagination moving without repugnance in the direction of
Mordecai's desires. With all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) latent objection to schemes only
definite in their generality and nebulous in detail--in the poise of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) sentiments he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) felt at one with this man who had made a visionary
selection of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>): the lines of what may be called their emotional
theory touched. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had not the Jewish consciousness, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had a
yearning, grown the stronger for the denial which had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
grievance, after the obligation of avowed filial and social ties. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
feeling was ready for difficult obedience. In this way it came that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
set about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) new task ungrudgingly; and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) thought of Mrs.
Meyrick as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) chief helper. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) first he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) must make known the
discovery of Mirah's brother, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) must consult on all
preliminaries of bringing the mutually lost together. Happily the best
quarter for a consumptive patient did not lie too far off the small
house at Chelsea, and the first office Deronda had to perform for this
Hebrew prophet who claimed him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as a spiritual inheritor, was to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
a healthy lodging. Such is the irony of earthly mixtures, that the
heroes have not always had carpets and teacups of their own; and, seen
through the open window by the mackerel-vender, may have been invited
with some hopefulness to pay three hundred per cent, in the form of
fourpence. However, Deronda's mind was busy with a prospective
arrangement for giving a furnished lodging some faint likeness to a
refined home by dismantling his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own chambers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) best old books in
vellum, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) easiest chair, and the bas-reliefs of Milton and Dante.

<p/>But was not Mirah to be there? What furniture can give such finish to a
room as a tender woman's face?--and is there any harmony of tints that
has such stirrings of delight as the sweet modulation of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice?
Here is one good, at least, thought Deronda, that comes to Mordecai
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) having fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagination on me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) has recovered a perfect
sister, whose affection is waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XLIV.

<p/>Fairy folk a-listening
Hear the seed sprout in the spring.
And for music to their dance
Hear the hedgerows wake from trance,
Sap that trembles into buds
Sending little rhythmic floods
Of fairy sound in fairy ears.
Thus all beauty that appears
Has birth as sound to finer sense
And lighter-clad intelligence.


<p/>And Gwendolen? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was thinking of Deronda much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--often wondering what were his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ideas <div class="bookquote">``about things,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life was occupied. But a lap-dog would be necessarily at a
loss in framing to itself the motives and adventures of doghood at
large; and it was as far from Gwendolen's conception that Deronda's
life could be determined by the historical destiny of the Jews, as that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could rise into the air on a brazen horse, and so vanish from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
horizon in the form of a twinkling star.

<p/>With all the sense of inferiority that had been forced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), it was
inevitable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should imagine a larger place for herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
thoughts than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) actually possessed. They must be rather old and wise
persons who are not apt to see their own anxiety or elation about
themselves reflected in other minds; and Gwendolen, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) youth and
inward solitude, may be excused for dwelling on signs of special
interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) shown by the one person who had impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with the
feeling of submission, and for mistaking the color and proportion of
those signs in the mind of Deronda.

<p/>Meanwhile, what would he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ought to do? <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, I
must get more interest in others, and more knowledge, and that I must
care about the best things--but how am I to begin?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wondered what
books he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to take up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own room, and recalled the
famous writers that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had either not looked into or had found the
most unreadable, with a half-smiling wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could mischievously
ask Deronda if they were not the books called <div class="bookquote">``medicine for the mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) repented of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sauciness, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was safe from
observation carried up a miscellaneous selection--Descartes, Bacon,
Locke, Butler, Burke, Guizot--knowing, as a clever young lady of
education, that these authors were ornaments of mankind, feeling sure
that Deronda had read them, and hoping that by dipping into them all in
succession, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rapid understanding she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might get a point of view
nearer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) level.

<p/>But it was astonishing how little time she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found for these vast mental
excursions. Constantly she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had to be on the scene as Mrs. Grandcourt,
and to feel herself watched in that part by the exacting eyes of a
husband who had found a motive to exercise his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tenacity--that of making
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) marriage answer all the ends he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chose, and with the more
completeness the more he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) discerned any opposing will in her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
herself, whatever rebellion might be going on within her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), could not
have made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mind to failure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) representation. No feeling had
yet reconciled her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) for a moment to any act, word, or look that would be
a confession to the world: and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) most dreaded in herself was any
violent impulse that would make an involuntary confession: it was the
will to be silent in every other direction that had thrown the more
impetuosity into her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) confidences toward Deronda, to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thought
continually turned as a help against herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) riding, her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hunting,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) visiting and receiving of visits, were all performed in a spirit of
achievement which served instead of zest and young gladness, so that
all around Diplow, in those weeks of the new year, Mrs. Grandcourt was
regarded as wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) honors with triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) disguises it under an air of taking everything as a matter of
course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Arrowpoint/Arrowpoint</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Arrowpoint. <div class="bookquote">``A stranger might suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) had
condescended rather than risen. I always noticed that doubleness in
her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Arrowpoint</b></font>) mother most of all Gwendolen was bent on acting complete
satisfaction, and poor Mrs. Davilow was so far deceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) took
the unexpected distance at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) was kept, in spite of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
felt to be Grandcourt's handsome behavior in providing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>), as a
comparative indifference in her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) daughter, now that marriage had created
new interests. To be fetched to lunch and then to dinner along with the
Gascoignes, to be driven back soon after breakfast the next morning,
and to have brief calls from Gwendolen in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband waited for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) outside either on horseback or sitting in the carriage, was all the
intercourse allowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother.

<p/>The truth was, that the second time Gwendolen proposed to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mother with Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne, Grandcourt had at first been
silent, and then drawled, <div class="bookquote">``We can't be having _those people_ always.
Gascoigne talks too much. Country clergy are always bores--with their
confounded fuss about everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>That speech was full of foreboding for Gwendolen. To have her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother
classed under <div class="bookquote">``those people''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>was enough to confirm the previous dread
of bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) too near. Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not give the true
reasons--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grandcourt wants to
recognize you as little as possible; and besides it is better you
should not see much of my married life, else you might find out that I
am miserable.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) waived as lightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could every allusion to
the subject; and when Mrs. Davilow again hinted the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
having a house close to Ryelands, Gwendolen said, <div class="bookquote">``It would not be so
nice for you as being near the rectory here, mamma. We shall perhaps be
very little at Ryelands. You would miss my aunt and uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>And all the while this contemptuous veto of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's on any
intimacy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) family, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) proudly shrink from giving them
the aspect of troublesome pensioners, was rousing more inward
inclination toward them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never felt so kindly toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle,
so much disposed to look back on his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) cheerful, complacent activity and
spirit of kind management, even when mistaken, as more of a comfort
than the neutral loftiness which was every day chilling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). And here
perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was unconsciously finding some of that mental enlargement
which it was hard to get from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) occasional dashes into difficult
authors, who instead of blending themselves with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) daily agitations
required her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to dismiss them.

<p/>It was a delightful surprise one day when Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne were
at Offendene to see Gwendolen ride up without her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband--with the
groom only. All, including the four girls and Miss Merry, seated in the
dining-room at lunch, could see the welcome approach; and even the
elder ones were not without something of Isabel's romantic sense that
the beautiful sister on the splendid chestnut, which held its head as
if proud to bear her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), was a sort of Harriet Byron or Miss Wardour
reappearing out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``happiness ever after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet Byron Wardour</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) uncle went to the door to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sprang from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) horse with an air of alacrity which might well encourage that
notion of guaranteed happiness; for Gwendolen was particularly bent
to-day on setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's heart at rest, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) unusual sense of
freedom in being able to make this visit alone enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to bear up
under the pressure of painful facts which were urging themselves anew.
The seven family kisses were not so tiresome as they used to be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grandcourt is gone out, so I determined to fill up the time by
coming to you, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hat and
seated herself next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother; and then looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with a
playfully monitory air, <div class="bookquote">``That is a punishment to you for not wearing
better lace on your head. You didn't think I should come and detect
you--you dreadfully careless-about-yourself mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gave a
caressing touch to the dear head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scold me, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) delicate worn face flushing
with delight. <div class="bookquote">``But I wish there was something you could eat after your
ride--instead of these scraps. Let Jocosa make you a cup of chocolate
in your old way. You used to like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Merry</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Merry immediately rose and went out, though Gwendolen said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
no, a piece of bread, or one of those hard biscuits. I can't think
about eating. I am come to say good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! going to Ryelands again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we are going to town,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, beginning to break up a
piece of bread, but putting no morsel into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is rather early to go to town,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne, <div class="bookquote">``and Mr.
Grandcourt not in Parliament.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there is only one more day's hunting to be had, and Henleigh has
some business in town with lawyers, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I am
very glad. I shall like to go to town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will see your house in Grosvenor Square,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
and the girls were devouring with their eyes every movement of their
goddess, soon to vanish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a tone of assent to the interest of that
expectation. <div class="bookquote">``And there is so much to be seen and done in town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish, my dear Gwendolen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, in a kind of cordial
advice, <div class="bookquote">``that you would use your influence with Mr. Grandcourt to
induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to enter Parliament. A man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position should make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
weight felt in politics. The best judges are confident that the
ministry will have to appeal to the country on this question of further
Reform, and Mr. Grandcourt should be ready for the opportunity. I am
not quite sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) opinions and mine accord entirely; I have not
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) express himself very fully. But I don't look at the matter
from that point of view. I am thinking of your husband's standing in
the country. And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has now come to that stage of life when a man like
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should enter into public affairs. A wife has great influence with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband. Use yours in that direction, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>The rector felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) was acquitting himself of a duty here, and
giving something like the aspect of a public benefit to his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) niece's
match. To Gwendolen the whole speech had the flavor of bitter comedy.
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been merry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) must have laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle's explanation
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had not heard Grandcourt express himself very fully on
politics. And the wife's great influence! General maxims about husbands
and wives seemed now of a precarious usefulness. Gwendolen herself had
once believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) future influence as an omnipotence in
managing--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not know exactly what. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chief concern at
present was to give an answer that would be felt appropriate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very glad, uncle. But I think Mr. Grandcourt would not
like the trouble of an election--at least, unless it could be without
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) making speeches. I thought candidates always made speeches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not necessarily--to any great extent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne. <div class="bookquote">``A man of
position and weight can get on without much of it. A county member need
have very little trouble in that way, and both out of the House and in
it is liked the better for not being a speechifier. Tell Mr. Grandcourt
that I say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here comes Jocosa with my chocolate after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
escaping from a promise to give information that would certainly have
been received in a way inconceivable to the good rector, who, pushing
his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) chair a little aside from the table and crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) leg, looked as
well as if he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) felt like a worthy specimen of a clergyman and magistrate
giving experienced advice. Mr. Gascoigne had come to the conclusion
that Grandcourt was a proud man, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own self-love, calmed through
life by the consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) general value and personal advantages,
was not irritable enough to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) from hoping the best about his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
niece's husband because her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) uncle was kept rather haughtily at a
distance. A certain aloofness must be allowed to the representative of
an old family; you would not expect him (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) to be on intimate terms even
with abstractions. But Mrs. Gascoigne was less dispassionate on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)
husband's account, and felt Grandcourt's haughtiness as something a
little blameable in Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your uncle and Anna will very likely be in town about Easter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)
said, with a vague sense of expressing a slight discontent. <div class="bookquote">``Dear Rex
hopes to come out with honors and a fellowship, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) wants his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father
and Anna to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) in London, that they may be jolly together, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
says. I shouldn't wonder if Lord Brackenshaw invited them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) has been
so very kind since he (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) came back to the Castle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope my uncle will bring Ann to stay in Grosvenor Square,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, risking herself so far, for the sake of the present moment,
but in reality wishing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might never be obliged to bring any of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) family near Grandcourt again. <div class="bookquote">``I am very glad of Rex's good
fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must not be premature, and rejoice too much beforehand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>said the
rector, to whom this topic was the happiest in the world, and
altogether allowable, now that the issue of that little affair about
Gwendolen had been so satisfactory. <div class="bookquote">``Not but that I am in
correspondence with impartial judges, who have the highest hopes about
my son, as a singularly clear-headed young man. And of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excellent
disposition and principle I have had the best evidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a great lawyer some time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very nice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a concealed scepticism as to
niceness in general, which made the word quite applicable to lawyers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Talking of Lord Brackenshaw's kindness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, <div class="bookquote">``you don't
know how delightful he (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) has been, Gwendolen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) has begged me to
consider myself his (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) guest in this house till I can get another that I
like--he (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>) did it in the most graceful way. But now a house has turned
up. Old Mr. Jodson is dead, and we can have his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) house. It is just what
I want; small, but with nothing hideous to make you miserable thinking
about it. And it is only a mile from the Rectory. You remember the low
white house nearly hidden by the trees, as we turn up the lane to the
church?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you have no furniture, poor mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a
melancholy tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am saving money for that. You know who has made me rather rich,
dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) hand on Gwendolen's. <div class="bookquote">``And Jocosa
really makes so little do for housekeeping--it is quite wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please let me go up-stairs with you and arrange my hat, mamma,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, suddenly putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hair and perhaps
creating a desired disarrangement. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart was swelling, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
ready to cry. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother _must_ have been worse off, if it had not been
for Grandcourt. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I shall never see all this again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, looking round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), as they entered the black and yellow
bedroom, and then throwing herself into a chair in front of the glass
with a little groan as of bodily fatigue. In the resolve not to cry she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had become very pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not well, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; that chocolate has made me sick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
hand to be taken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be allowed to come to you if you were ill, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Davilow, rather timidly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) pressed the hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) bosom.
Something had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) sure today that her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) child loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)--needed her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
as much as ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, though
speaking as lightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">``But you know I never am ill. I am as
strong as possible; and you must not take to fretting about me, but
make yourself as happy as you can with the girls. They are better
children to you than I have been, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face
with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have always been good, my darling. I remember nothing else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what did I ever do that was good to you, except marry Mr.
Grandcourt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, starting up with a desperate resolve to be
playful, and keep no more on the perilous edge of agitation. <div class="bookquote">``And I
should not have done that unless it had pleased myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tossed up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chin, and reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God forbid, child! I would not have had you marry for my sake. Your
happiness by itself is half mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hat fastidiously, <div class="bookquote">``then you
will please to consider that you are half happy, which is more than I
am used to seeing you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>With the last words she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) again turned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
old playful smile to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Now I am ready; but oh, mamma, Mr.
Grandcourt gives me a quantity of money, and expects me to spend it,
and I can't spend it; and you know I can't bear charity children and
all that; and here are thirty pounds. I wish the girls would spend it
for me on little things for themselves when you go to the new house.
Tell them so.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen put the notes into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's hands and
looked away hastily, moving toward the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow. <div class="bookquote">``It will please them so that
you should have thought of them in particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they are troublesome things; but they don't trouble me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, turning and nodding playfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hardly understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own
feeling in this act toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sisters, but at any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not
wish it to be taken as anything serious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was glad to have got out
of the bedroom without showing more signs of emotion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went
through the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) visit and all the good-byes with a quiet
propriety that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) say to herself sarcastically as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rode away,
<div class="bookquote">``I think I am making a very good Mrs. Grandcourt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband had gone to Gadsmere that day--had
inferred this, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had long ago inferred who were the inmates of
what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had described as <div class="bookquote">``a dog-hutch of a place in a black country;''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the strange conflict of feeling within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had had the
characteristic effect of sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to Offendene with a tightened
resolve--a form of excitement which was native to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own contradictions. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feel it bitter
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that Grandcourt showed concern for the beings on whose account
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) herself was undergoing remorse? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) not before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) marriage
inwardly determined to speak and act on their behalf?--and since he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had
lately implied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wanted to be in town because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was making
arrangements about his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) will, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ought to have been glad of any sign
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) kept a conscience awake toward those at Gadsmere; and yet, now
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was a wife, the sense that Grandcourt was gone to Gadsmere was
like red heat near a burn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had brought on herself this indignity in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own eyes--this humiliation of being doomed to a terrified silence
lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband should discover with what sort of consciousness she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had married him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had said to Deronda, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``must go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After the intense moments of secret hatred toward this husband who from
the very first had cowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), there always came back the spiritual
pressure which made submission inevitable. There was no effort at
freedoms that would not bring fresh and worse humiliation. Gwendolen
could dare nothing except an impulsive action--least of all could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
dare premeditatedly a vague future in which the only certain condition
was indignity. In spite of remorse, it still seemed the worst result of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) marriage that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should in any way make a spectacle of herself;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) humiliation was lightened by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thinking that only Mrs.
Glasher was aware of the fact which caused it. For Gwendolen had never
referred the interview at the Whispering Stones to Lush's agency; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
disposition to vague terror investing with shadowy omnipresence any
threat of fatal power over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and so hindering her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from imagining
plans and channels by which news had been conveyed to the woman who had
the poisoning skill of a sorceress. To Gwendolen's mind the secret lay
with Mrs. Glasher, and there were words in the horrible letter which
implied that Mrs. Glasher would dread disclosure to the husband, as
much as the usurping Mrs. Grandcourt.

<p/>Something else, too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thought of as more of a secret from her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
husband than it really was--namely that suppressed struggle of
desperate rebellion which she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) herself dreaded. Grandcourt could not
indeed fully imagine how things affected Gwendolen: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had no
imagination of anything in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) but what affected the gratification of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own will; but on this point he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had the sensibility which seems like
divination. What we see exclusively we are apt to see with some mistake
of proportions; and Grandcourt was not likely to be infallible in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
judgments concerning this wife who was governed by many shadowy powers,
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) nonexistent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) magnified her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) inward resistance, but that did
not lessen his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) satisfaction in the mastery of it.




<p/>CHAPTER XLV.

<p/>Behold my lady's carriage stop the way.
With powdered lacquey and with charming bay;
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sweeps the matting, treads the crimson stair.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arduous function solely <div class="bookquote">``to be there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Like Sirius rising o'er the silent sea.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hides her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart in lustre loftily.


<p/>So the Grandcourts were in Grosvenor Square in time to receive a card
for the musical party at Lady Mallinger's, there being reasons of
business which made Sir Hugo know beforehand that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) ill-beloved
nephew was coming up. It was only the third evening after their
arrival, and Gwendolen made rather an absent-minded acquaintance with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) new ceilings and furniture, preoccupied with the certainty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was going to speak to Deronda again, and also to see the Miss Lapidoth
who had gone through so much, and was <div class="bookquote">``capable of submitting to
anything in the form of duty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lapidoth/Miss Lapidoth</b></font>)</div>For Gwendolen had remembered nearly
every word that Deronda had said about Mirah, and especially that
phrase, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) repeated to herself bitterly, having an ill-defined
consciousness that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own submission was something very different. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
would have been obliged to allow, if any one had said it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), that
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) submitted to could not take the shape of duty, but was
submission to a yoke drawn on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) by an action she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was ashamed of, and
worn with a strength of selfish motives that left no weight for duty to
carry.

<p/>The drawing-rooms in Park Lane, all white, gold, and pale crimson, were
agreeably furnished, and not crowded with guests, before Mr. and Mrs.
Grandcourt entered; and more than half an hour of instrumental music
was being followed by an interval of movement and chat. Klesmer was
there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) wife, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) generous interest for Mirah he (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) proposed
to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) singing of Leo's <div class="bookquote">''_O patria mia_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leo</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leo</b></font>) had before
recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to choose, as more distinctive of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) than better known
music. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leo</b></font>) was already at the piano, and Mirah was standing there
conspicuously, when Gwendolen, magnificent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pale green velvet and
poisoned diamonds, was ushered to a seat of honor well in view of them.
With her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) long sight and self-command she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had the rare power of quickly
distinguishing persons and objects on entering a full room, and while
turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) glance toward Mirah she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not neglect to exchange a bow
with Klesmer as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) passed. The smile seemed to each a lightning-flash
back on that morning when it had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ambition to stand as the
<div class="bookquote">``little Jewess''  (<font color='red'><b>a audience</b></font>)</div>was standing, and survey a grand audience from the
higher rank of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) talent--instead of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was one of the ordinary
crowd in silk and gems, whose utmost performance it must be to admire
or find fault. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thinks I am in the right road now,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said the lurking
resentment within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/>Gwendolen had not caught sight of Deronda in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) passage, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was seated acquitting herself in chat with Sir Hugo, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) glanced round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with careful ease, bowing a recognition here and there, and fearful
lest an anxious-looking exploration in search of Deronda might be
observed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband, and afterward rebuked as something <div class="bookquote">``damnably
vulgar.''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>But all traveling, even that of a slow gradual glance round a
room, brings a liability to undesired encounters, and amongst the eyes
that met Gwendolen's, forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) into a slight bow, were those of the
<div class="bookquote">``amateur too fond of Meyerbeer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lush, whom Sir Hugo continued to
find useful as a half-caste among gentlemen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was standing near her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
husband, who, however, turned a shoulder toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>), and was being
understood to listen to Lord Pentreath. How was it that at this moment,
for the first time, there darted through Gwendolen, like a disagreeable
sensation, the idea that this man knew all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's life? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had been banished from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sight, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) will, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
been satisfied; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sunk entirely into the background of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
thoughts, screened away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) by the agitating figures that kept up
an inward drama in which Lush had no place. Here suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reappeared
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's elbow, and there sprang up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), like an
instantaneously fabricated memory in a dream, the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being
connected with the secrets that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wretched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was conscious of
effort in turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), trying to continue her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
wandering survey as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had seen nothing of more consequence than
the picture on the wall, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) discovered Deronda. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not
looking toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), without having
got any recognition, consoling herself with the assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) must
have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) come in. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not standing far from the door
with Hans Meyrick, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had been careful to bring into Lady
Mallinger's list. They were both a little more anxious than was
comfortable lest Mirah should not be heard to advantage. Deronda even
felt himself on the brink of betraying emotion, Mirah's presence now
being linked with crowding images of what had gone before and was to
come after--all centering in the brother he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was soon to reveal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>);
and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had escaped as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could from the side of Lady Pentreath,
who had said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) violoncello voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, your Jewess is pretty--there's no denying that. But where is her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
Jewish impudence? She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) looks as demure as a nun. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) learned
that on the stage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pentreath</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was beginning to feel on Mirah's behalf something of what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had
felt for himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seraphic boyish time, when Sir Hugo asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) would like to be a great singer--an indignant dislike to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>)
being remarked on in a free and easy way, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pentreath</b></font>) were an imported
commodity disdainfully paid for by the fashionable public, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
winced the more because Mordecai, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) knew, would feel that the name
<div class="bookquote">``Jewess''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was taken as a sort of stamp like the lettering of Chinese
silk. In this susceptible mood he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) saw the Grandcourts enter, and was
immediately appealed to by Hans about <div class="bookquote">``that Vandyke duchess of a
beauty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>Pray excuse Deronda that in this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt a transient
renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) first repulsion from Gwendolen, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) beauty
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) failings were to blame for the undervaluing of Mirah as a
woman--a feeling something like class animosity, which affection for
what is not fully recognized by others, whether in persons or in
poetry, rarely allows us to escape. To Hans admiring Gwendolen with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
habitual hyperbole, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) answered, with a sarcasm that was not quite
good-natured--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you could admire no style of woman but your Berenice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the style I worship--not admire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans. <div class="bookquote">``Other styles of
women I might make myself wicked for, but for Berenice I could make
myself--well, pretty good, which is something much more difficult.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, under the pretext that the singing was going to
begin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not so delighted with the answer as might have been
expected, and was relieved by Hans's movement to a more advanced spot.

<p/>Deronda had never before heard Mirah sing <div class="bookquote">''_O patria mia_.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) knew
well Leopardi's fine Ode to Italy -LRB-when Italy sat like a disconsolate
mother in chains, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knees and weeping-RRB-, and the
few selected words were filled for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with the grandeur of the whole,
which seemed to breath an inspiration through the music. Mirah singing
this, made Mordecai more than ever one presence with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Certain words
not included in the song nevertheless rang within Deronda as harmonies
from the invisible--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Non ti difende
Nessun dè tuoi! L'armi, qua l'armi: io solo
Combatteró, procomberó sol io'' (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>--
-LSB-Footnote: Do none of thy children defend thee? Arms! bring me arms!
alone I will fight, alone I will fall.-RSB-

<p/>they seemed the very voice of that heroic passion which is falsely said
to devote itself in vain when it achieves the god-like end of
manifesting unselfish love. And that passion was present to Deronda now
as the vivid image of a man dying helplessly away from the possibility
of battle.

<p/>Mirah was equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wishes. While the general applause was sounding,
Klesmer gave a more valued testimony, audible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) only--<div class="bookquote">``Good,
good--the crescendo better than before.''  (<font color='red'><b>Klesmer/Herr Klesmer</b></font>)</div>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) chief anxiety was to
know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) had satisfied Mr. Deronda: any failure on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) part this
evening would have pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) as an especial injury to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). Of course
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) prospects were due to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>); still, this
occasion of singing in the house that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) home brought a peculiar
demand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) looked toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in the distance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) did;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) remained where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was, and watched the streams of emulous
admirers closing round her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>), till presently they parted to make way for
Gwendolen, who was taken up to be introduced by Mrs. Klesmer. Easier
now about <div class="bookquote">``the little Jewess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Daniel relented toward poor Gwendolen in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) splendor, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) memory went back, with some penitence for his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>)
momentary hardness, over all the signs and confessions that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) too
needed a rescue, and one much more difficult than that of the wanderer
by the river--a rescue for which he (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) felt himself helpless. The silent
question--<div class="bookquote">``But is it not cowardly to make that a reason for turning
away?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was the form in which he (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) framed his (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) resolve to go near her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) on
the first opportunity, and show his (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) past confidence, in
spite of Sir Hugo's unwelcome hints.

<p/>Klesmer, having risen to Gwendolen as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) approached, and being
included by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in the opening conversation with Mirah, continued near
them a little while, looking down with a smile, which was rather in his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>)
eyes than on his (<font color='blue'><b>Klesmer</b></font>) lips, at the piquant contrast of the two charming
young creatures seated on the red divan. The solicitude seemed to be
all on the side of the splendid one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must let me say how much I am obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I
had heard from Mr. Deronda that I should have a great treat in your
singing, but I was too ignorant to imagine how great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good to say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>answered Mirah, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind chiefly
occupied in contemplating Gwendolen. It was like a new kind of
stage-experience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to be close to genuine grand ladies with
genuine brilliants and complexions, and they impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) vaguely as
coming out of some unknown drama, in which their parts perhaps got more
tragic as they went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall all want to learn of you--I, at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I
sing very badly, as Herr Klesmer will tell you,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--here she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) glanced
upward to that higher power rather archly, and continued--<div class="bookquote">``but I have
been rebuked for not liking to middling, since I can be nothing more. I
think that is a different doctrine from yours?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was still looking
at Klesmer, who said quickly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if it means that it would be worth while for you to study further,
and for Miss Lapidoth to have the pleasure of helping you.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>With that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) moved away, and Mirah taking everything with _naïve_ seriousness,
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you think I could teach you, I shall be very glad. I am anxious to
teach, but I have only just begun. If I do it well, it must be by
remembering how my master taught me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen was in reality too uncertain about herself to be prepared for
this simple promptitude of Mirah's, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wish to change the
subject, said, with some lapse from the good taste of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) first
address--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not been long in London, I think?--but you were perhaps
introduced to Mr. Deronda abroad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah; <div class="bookquote">``I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) before I came to England in the
summer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) has seen you often and heard you sing a great deal, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, led on partly by the wish to hear anything about
Deronda, and partly by the awkwardness which besets the readiest
person, in carrying on a dialogue when empty of matter. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) spoke of
you to me with the highest praise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) seemed to know you quite well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I was poor and needed help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, in a new tone of feeling,
<div class="bookquote">``and Mr. Deronda has given me the best friends in the world. That is
the only way he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) came to know anything about me--because he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was sorry
for me. I had no friends when I came. I was in distress. I owe
everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Gwendolen, who had wanted to be a struggling artist herself, could
nevertheless not escape the impression that a mode of inquiry which
would have been rather rude toward herself was an amiable condescension
to this Jewess who was ready to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lessons. The only effect on
Mirah, as always on any mention of Deronda, was to stir reverential
gratitude and anxiety that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should be understood to have the deepest
obligation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/>But both he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and Hans, who were noticing the pair from a distance, would
have felt rather indignant if they had known that the conversation had
led up to Mirah's representation of herself in this light of neediness.
In the movement that prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), however, there was an exquisite
delicacy, which perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not have stated explicitly--the
feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ought not to allow any one to assume in Deronda a
relation of more equality or less generous interest toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) than
actually existed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) answer was delightful to Gwendolen: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought
of nothing but the ready compassion which in another form she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
trusted in and found herself; and on the signals that Klesmer was about
to play she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) moved away in much content, entirely without presentiment
that this Jewish _protégé_ would ever make a more important difference
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life than the possible improvement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) singing--if the
leisure and spirits of a Mrs. Grandcourt would allow of other lessons
than such as the world was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) at rather a high charge.

<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wonted alternation from resolute care of appearances to some
rash indulgence of an impulse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) chose, under the pretext of getting
farther from the instrument, not to go again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) former seat, but
placed herself on a settee where she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could only have one neighbor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
was nearer to Deronda than before: was it surprising that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) came up in
time to shake hands before the music began--then, that after he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had
stood a little while by the elbow of the settee at the empty end, the
torrent-like confluences of bass and treble seemed, like a convulsion
of nature, to cast the conduct of petty mortals into insignificance,
and to warrant his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sitting down?

<p/>But when at the end of Klesmer's playing there came the outburst of
talk under which Gwendolen had hoped to speak as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would to Deronda,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) observed that Mr. Lush was within hearing, leaning against the wall
close by them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not help her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) flush of anger, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tried to
have only an air of polite indifference in saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Lapidoth is everything you described her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been very quick in discovering that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
ironically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not found out all the excellencies you spoke of--I don't mean
that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen; <div class="bookquote">``but I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) singing is charming, and
herself, too. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) face is lovely--not in the least common; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) is
such a complete little person. I should think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) will be a great
success.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>This speech was grating on Deronda, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would not answer it, but
looked gravely before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was displeased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was getting so impatient under the neighborhood of Mr. Lush,
which prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from saying any word she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wanted to say, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
meditated some desperate step to get rid of it, and remained silent,
too. That constraint seemed to last a long while, neither Gwendolen nor
Deronda looking at the other, till Lush slowly relieved the wall of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
weight, and joined some one at a distance.

<p/>Gwendolen immediately said, <div class="bookquote">``You despise me for talking artificially.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) coolly; <div class="bookquote">``I think that is quite
excusable sometimes. But I did not think what you were last saying was
altogether artificial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was something in it that displeased you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``What
was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible to explain such things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``One can never
communicate niceties of feeling about words and manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think I am shut out from understanding them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with
a slight tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) voice, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was trying to conquer. <div class="bookquote">``Have I
shown myself so very dense to everything you have said?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>There was an
indescribable look of suppressed tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, which were turned
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with some softening of voice. <div class="bookquote">``But
experience differs for different people. We don't all wince at the same
things. I have had plenty of proof that you are not dense.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) smiled
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But one may feel things and are not able to do anything better for all
that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, not smiling in return--the distance to which
Deronda's words seemed to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chilling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) too much. <div class="bookquote">``I begin to
think we can only get better by having people about us who raise good
feelings. You must not be surprised at anything in me. I think it is
too late for me to alter. I don't know how to set about being wise, as
you told me to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I seldom find I do any good by my preaching. I might as well have kept
from meddling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, thinking rather sadly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
interference about that unfortunate necklace might end in nothing but
an added pain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) after all hardened to another sort
of gambling than roulette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, hurriedly, feeling that this might be
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) only chance of getting the words uttered, and dreading the increase
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own agitation. <div class="bookquote">``If you despair of me, I shall despair. Your
saying that I should not go on being selfish and ignorant has been some
strength to me. If you say you wish you had not meddled--that means you
despair of me and forsake me. And then you will decide for me that I
shall not be good. It is you who will decide; because you might have
made me different by keeping as near to me as you could, and believing
in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not been looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoke, but at the handle of the
fan which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) held closed. With the last words she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rose and left him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>),
returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) former place, which had been left vacant; while every
one was settling into quietude in expectation of Mirah's voice, which
presently, with that wonderful, searching quality of subdued song in
which the melody seems simply an effect of the emotion, gave forth,
_Per pietà non dirmi addio_.

<p/>In Deronda's ear the strain was for the moment a continuance of
Gwendolen's pleading--a painful urging of something vague and
difficult, irreconcilable with pressing conditions, and yet cruel to
resist. However strange the mixture in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) of a resolute pride and a
precocious air of knowing the world, with a precipitate, guileless
indiscretion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was quite sure now that the mixture existed. Sir
Hugo's hints had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) alive to dangers that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) own disposition
might have neglected; but that Gwendolen's reliance on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was
unvisited by any dream of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) being a man who could misinterpret her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was as manifest as morning, and made an appeal which wrestled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
sense of present dangers, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) foreboding of a growing
incompatible claim on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind. There was a foreshadowing of
some painful collision: on the one side the grasp of Mordecai's dying
hand on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), with all the ideals and prospects it aroused; on the other
the fair creature in silk and gems, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hidden wound and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
self-dread, making a trustful effort to lean and find herself
sustained. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had a vision of himself besought with
outstretched arms and cries, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was caught by the waves and
compelled to mount the vessel bound for a far-off coast. That was the
strain of excited feeling in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) that went along with the notes of
Mirah's song; but when it ceased he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) moved from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) seat with the
reflection that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had been falling into an exaggeration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own
importance, and a ridiculous readiness to accept Gwendolen's view of
himself, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) could really have any decisive power over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an enviable fellow you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``sitting on a sofa
with that young duchess, and having an interesting quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>repeated Deronda, rather uncomfortably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, about theology, of course; nothing personal. But she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) told you what
you ought to think, and then left you with a grand air which was
admirable. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) an Antinomian--if so, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) I am an Antinomian
painter, and introduce me. I should like to paint her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) husband.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has the sort of handsome _physique_ that the Duke ought to have in
_Lucrezia Borgia_--if it could go with a fine baritone, which it can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda devoutly hoped that Hans's account of the impression his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
dialogue with Gwendolen had made on a distant beholder was no more than
a bit of fantastic representation, such as was common with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/>And Gwendolen was not without her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) after-thoughts that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's
eyes might have been on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), extracting something to reprove--some
offence against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dignity as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consciousness telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not kept up the perfect air of equability in public which
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own ideal. But Grandcourt made no observation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) behavior.
All he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said as they were driving home was--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lush will dine with us among the other people to-morrow. You will
treat him (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) civilly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen's heart began to beat violently. The words that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wanted to
utter, as one wants to return a blow, were. <div class="bookquote">``You are breaking your
promise to me--the first promise you made me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dared not utter
them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was as frightened at a quarrel as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had foreseen that it
would end with throttling fingers on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck. After a pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said
in the tone rather of defeat than resentment--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you did not intend him (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) to frequent the house again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want him (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) just now. He (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) is useful to me; and he (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) must be treated

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Silence. There may come a moment when even an excellent husband who has
dropped smoking under more or less of a pledge during courtship, for
the first time will introduce his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cigar-smoke between himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
wife, with the tacit understanding that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will have to put up with
it. Mr. Lush was, so to speak, a very large cigar.

<p/>If these are the sort of lovers' vows at which Jove laughs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) must
have a merry time of it.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVI.

<p/>``If any one should importune me to give a reason why I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>), I
feel it could no otherwise be expressed than by making answer,
``Because it was he (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>), because it was I.<div class="bookquote">'' There is, beyond what I am able
to say, I know not what inexplicable power that brought on this
union.'' (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>--MONTAIGNE: _On Friendship_.


<p/>The time had come to prepare Mordecai for the revelation of the
restored sister and for the change of abode which was desirable before
Mirah's meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother. Mrs. Meyrick, to whom Deronda had
confided everything except Mordecai's peculiar relation to himself, had
been active in helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to find a suitable lodging in Brompton, not
many minutes' walk from her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) own house, so that the brother and sister
would be within reach of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) motherly care. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) happy mixture of
Scottish fervor and Gallic liveliness had enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) to keep the
secret close from the girls as well as from Hans, any betrayal to them
being likely to reach Mirah in some way that would raise an agitating
suspicion, and spoil the important opening of that work which was to
secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) independence, as we rather arbitrarily call one of the more
arduous and dignified forms of our dependence. And both Mrs. Meyrick
and Deronda had more reasons than they could have expressed for
desiring that Mirah should be able to maintain herself. Perhaps <div class="bookquote">``the
little mother''  (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div>was rather helped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) secrecy by some dubiousness in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) sentiment about the remarkable brother described to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>); and
certainly if she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) felt any joy and anticipatory admiration, it was due
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) faith in Deronda's judgment. The consumption was a sorrowful
fact that appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) tenderness; but how was she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) to be very glad
of an enthusiasm which, to tell the truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) could only contemplate
as Jewish pertinacity, and as rather an undesirable introduction among
them all of a man whose conversation would not be more modern and
encouraging than that of Scott's Covenanters? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) mind was anything but
prosaic, and had her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) soberer share of Mab's delight in the romance of
Mirah's story and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) abode with them; but the romantic or unusual
in real life requires some adaptation. We sit up at night to read about
Sakya-Mouni, St. Francis, or Oliver Cromwell; but whether we should be
glad for any one at all like them to call on us the next morning, still
more, to reveal himself as a new relation, is quite another affair.
Besides, Mrs. Meyrick had hoped, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) children did, that the
intensity of Mirah's feeling about Judaism would slowly subside, and be
merged in the gradually deepening current of loving interchange with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) new friends. In fact, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) secret favorite continuation of the
romance had been no discovery of Jewish relations, but something much
more favorable to the hopes she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) discerned in Hans. And now--here was a
brother who would dip Mirah's mind over again in the deepest dye of
Jewish sentiment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) could not help saying to Deronda--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am as glad as you are that the pawnbroker is not her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother: there
are Ezras and Ezras in the world; and really it is a comfort to think
that all Jews are not like those shopkeepers who _will not_ let you get
out of their shops: and besides, what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said to you about his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother
and sister makes me bless him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s good. But I never did
like anything fanatical. I suppose I heard a little too much preaching
in my youth and lost my palate for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you will find that Mordecai obtrudes any preaching,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) is not what I should call fanatical. I call a man
fanatical when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enthusiasm is narrow and hoodwinked, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has
no sense of proportions, and becomes unjust and unsympathetic to men
who are out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own track. Mordecai is an enthusiast; I should like
to keep that word for the highest order of minds--those who care
supremely for grand and general benefits to mankind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) is not a
strictly orthodox Jew, and is full of allowances for others; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
conformity in many things is an allowance for the condition of other
Jews. The people he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) lives with are as fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) as possible, and they
can't in the least understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) ideas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, I can live up to the level of the pawnbroker's mother, and
like him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) for what I see to be good in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>); and for what I don't see the
merits of I will take your word. According to your definition, I
suppose one might be fanatical in worshipping common-sense; for my poor
husband used to say the world would be a poor place if there were
nothing but common-sense in it. However, Mirah's brother will have good
bedding--that I have taken care of; and I shall have this extra window
pasted up with paper to prevent draughts.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-The conversation was taking
place in the destined lodging.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``It is a comfort to think that the
people of the house are no strangers to me--no hypocritical harpies.
And when the children know, we shall be able to make the rooms much
prettier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The next stage of the affair is to tell all to Mordecai, and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
to move--which may be a more difficult business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And will you tell Mirah before I say anything to the children?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Meyrick. But Deronda hesitated, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) went on in a tone of
persuasive deliberation--<div class="bookquote">``No, I think not. Let me tell Hans and the
girls the evening before, and they will be away the next morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that will be best. But do justice to my account of Mordecai--or
Ezra, as I suppose Mirah will wish to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>): don't assist their
imagination by referring to Habakkuk Mucklewrath,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
smiling--Mrs. Meyrick herself having used the comparison of the
Covenanters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trust me, trust me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the little mother. <div class="bookquote">``I shall have to persuade
them so hard to be glad, that I shall convert myself. When I am
frightened I find it a good thing to have somebody to be angry with for
not being brave: it warms the blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda might have been more argumentative or persuasive about the view
to be taken of Mirah's brother, if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been less anxiously
preoccupied with the more important task immediately before him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), which
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) desired to acquit himself of without wounding the Cohens. Mordecai,
by a memorable answer, had made it evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) would be keenly
alive to any inadvertance in relation to their feelings. In the
interval, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had been meeting Mordecai at the _Hand and Banner_, but
now after due reflection he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had particular
reasons for wishing to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own home the next evening, and
would beg to sit with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) workroom for an hour, if the Cohens
would not regard it as an intrusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) would call with the
understanding that if there were any objection, Mordecai would
accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) elsewhere. Deronda hoped in this way to create a little
expectation that would have a preparatory effect.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was received with the usual friendliness, some additional costume in
the women and children, and in all the elders a slight air of wondering
which even in Cohen was not allowed to pass the bounds of silence--the
guest's transactions with Mordecai being a sort of mystery which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was
rather proud to think lay outside the sphere of light which enclosed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own understanding. But when Deronda said, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose Mordecai is at
home and expecting me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Jacob, who had profited by the family remarks,
went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) knee and said, <div class="bookquote">``What do you want to talk to Mordecai
about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something that is very interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, pinching the
lad's ear, <div class="bookquote">``but that you can't understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you say this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, immediately giving forth a string of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) rote-learned Hebrew verses with a wonderful mixture of the throaty
and the nasal, and nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) small head at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) hearer, with a sense
of giving formidable evidence which might rather alter their mutual
position.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, keeping grave; <div class="bookquote">``I can't say anything like
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, performing a dance of triumph with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
small scarlet legs, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) took various objects out of the deep
pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) knickerbockers and returned them thither, as a slight
hint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) resources; after which, running to the door of the
workroom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) opened it wide, set his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) back against it, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Mordecai, here's the young swell'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--a copying of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) father's phrase,
which seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) well fitted to cap the recitation of Hebrew.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was called back with hushes by mother and grandmother, and Deronda,
entering and closing the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), saw that a bit of carpet had
been laid down, a chair placed, and the fire and lights attended to, in
sign of the Cohens' respect. As Mordecai rose to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), Deronda was
struck with the air of solemn expectation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face, such as would
have seemed perfectly natural if his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) letter had declared that some
revelation was to be made about the lost sister. Neither of them spoke,
till Deronda, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) usual tenderness of manner, had drawn the vacant
chair from the opposite side of the hearth and had seated himself near
to Mordecai, who then said, in a tone of fervid certainty--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are coming to tell me something that my soul longs for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true I have something very weighty to tell you--something I
trust that you will rejoice in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) guard against the
probability that Mordecai had been preparing himself for something
quite different from the fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all revealed--it is made clear to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, more
eagerly, leaning forward with clasped hands. <div class="bookquote">``You are even as my
brother that sucked the breasts of my mother--the heritage is
yours--there is no doubt to divide us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have learned nothing new about myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. The
disappointment was inevitable: it was better not to let the feeling be
strained longer in a mistaken hope.

<p/>Mordecai sank back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) chair, unable for the moment to care what was
really coming. The whole day his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind had been in a state of tension
toward one fulfillment. The reaction was sickening and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Except,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda went on gently, after a pause,--<div class="bookquote">``except that I had
really some time ago come into another sort of hidden connection with
you, besides what you have spoken of as existing in your own feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>The eyes were not opened, but there was a fluttering in the lids.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had made the acquaintance of one in whom you are interested.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One who is closely related to your departed mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda went on
wishing to make the disclosure gradual; but noticing a shrinking
movement in Mordecai, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) added--<div class="bookquote">``whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and you held dear above all
others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai, with a sudden start, laid a spasmodic grasp on Deronda's
wrist; there was a great terror in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). And Deronda divined it. A
tremor was perceptible in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) clear tones as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was prayed for has come to pass: Mirah has been delivered from
evil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai's grasp relaxed a little, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was panting with a tearless
sob.

<p/>Deronda went on: <div class="bookquote">``Your sister is worthy of the mother you honored.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) waited there, and Mordecai, throwing himself backward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) chair,
again closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) eyes, uttering himself almost inaudibly for some
minutes in Hebrew, and then subsiding into a happy-looking silence.
Deronda, watching the expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) uplifted face, could have
imagined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was speaking with some beloved object: there was a new
suffused sweetness, something like that on the faces of the beautiful
dead. For the first time Deronda thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) discerned a family
resemblance to Mirah.

<p/>Presently when Mordecai was ready to listen, the rest was told. But in
accounting for Mirah's flight he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) made the statement about the father's
conduct as vague as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) could, and threw the emphasis on her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) yearning to
come to England as the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) might find her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) mother. Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
kept back the fact of Mirah's intention to drown herself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own
part in rescuing her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>); merely describing the home she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) had found with
friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), whose interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) and efforts for her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had
shared. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) dwelt on finally was Mirah's feeling about her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) mother
and brother; and in relation to this he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) tried to give every detail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was in search of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``that I turned into
this house: the name Ezra Cohen was just then the most interesting name
in the world to me. I confess I had fear for a long while. Perhaps you
will forgive me now for having asked you that question about the elder
Mrs. Cohen's daughter. I cared very much what I should find Mirah's
friends to be. But I had found a brother worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) when I knew that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) Ezra was disguised under the name of Mordecai.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mordecai is really my name--Ezra Mordecai Cohen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any kinship between this family and yours?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only the kinship of Israel. My soul clings to these people, who have
sheltered me and given me succor out of the affection that abides in
Jewish hearts, as sweet odor in things long crushed and hidden from the
outer air. It is good for me to bear with their ignorance and be bound
to them in gratitude, that I may keep in mind the spiritual poverty of
the Jewish million, and not put impatient knowledge in the stead of
loving wisdom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't feel bound to continue with them now there is a closer
tie to draw you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, not without fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might find an
obstacle to overcome. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me right now--is it not?--that you
should live with your sister; and I have prepared a home to take you to
in the neighborhood of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) friends, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) may join you there. Pray
grant me this wish. It will enable me to be with you often in the hours
when Mirah is obliged to leave you. That is my selfish reason. But the
chief reason is, that Mirah will desire to watch over you, and that you
ought to give her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) the guardianship of a brother's presence. You shall
have books about you. I shall want to learn of you, and to take you out
to see the river and trees. And you will have the rest and comfort that
you will be more and more in need of--nay, that I need for you. This is
the claim I make on you, now that we have found each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda spoke in a tone of earnest, affectionate pleading, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
might have used to a venerated elder brother. Mordecai's eyes were
fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) with a listening contemplation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was silent for a
little while after Deronda had ceased to speak. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, with an
almost reproachful emphasis--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you would have me hold it doubtful whether you were born a Jew!
Have we not from the first touched each other with invisible
fibres--have we not quivered together like the leaves from a common
stem with stirring from a common root? I know what I am outwardly, I am
one among the crowd of poor--I am stricken, I am dying. But our souls
know each other. They gazed in silence as those who have long been
parted and meet again, but when they found voice they were assured, and
all their speech is understanding. The life of Israel is in your veins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda sat perfectly still, but felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face tingling. It was
impossible either to deny or assent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) waited, hoping that Mordecai
would presently give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) a more direct answer. And after a pause of
meditation he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) did say, firmly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What you wish of me I will do. And our mother--may the blessing of the
Eternal be with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in our souls!--would have wished it too. I will
accept what your loving kindness has prepared, and Mirah's home shall
be mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) paused a moment, and then added in a more melancholy tone,
<div class="bookquote">``But I shall grieve to part from these parents and the little ones. You
must tell them, for my heart would fail me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt that you would want me to tell them. Shall we go now at once?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, much relieved by this unwavering compliance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; let us not defer it. It must be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, rising with
the air of a man who has to perform a painful duty. Then came, as an
afterthought, <div class="bookquote">``But do not dwell on my sister more than is needful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When they entered the parlor he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) said to the alert Jacob, <div class="bookquote">``Ask your
father to come, and tell Sarah to mind the shop. My friend has
something to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) continued, turning to the elder Mrs. Cohen. It
seemed part of Mordecai's eccentricity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) should call this
gentleman his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) friend; and the two women tried to show their better
manners by warm politeness in begging Deronda to seat himself in the
best place.

<p/>When Cohen entered with a pen behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) ear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) hands and
said with loud satisfaction, <div class="bookquote">``Well, sir! I'm glad you're doing us the
honor to join our family party again. We are pretty comfortable, I
think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) looked round with shiny gladness. And when all were seated on the
hearth the scene was worth peeping in upon: on one side Baby under her (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>)
scarlet quilt in the corner being rocked by the young mother, and
Adelaide Rebekah seated on the grandmother's knee; on the other, Jacob
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) father's legs; while the two markedly different figures of
Deronda and Mordecai were in the middle--Mordecai a little backward in
the shade, anxious to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) agitated susceptibility to what was
going on around him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). The chief light came from the fire, which brought
out the rich color on a depth of shadow, and seemed to turn into speech
the dark gems of eyes that looked at each other kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just been telling Mordecai of an event that makes a great
change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda began, <div class="bookquote">``but I hope you will agree with me
that it is a joyful one. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) thinks of you as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) best friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
wishes me to tell you for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Relations with money, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>burst in Cohen, feeling a power of
divination which it was a pity to nullify by waiting for the fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``But a very precious relation
wishes to be reunited to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)--a very good and lovely young sister, who
will care for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) comfort in every way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Married, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But with a maintenance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With talents which will secure her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a maintenance. A home is already
provided for Mordecai.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence for a moment or two before the grandmother said in a
wailing tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well! and so you're going away from us, Mordecai.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where there's no children as there is here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother,
catching the wail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No Jacob, and no Adelaide, and no Eugenie!''  (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div>wailed the grandmother
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, Jacob's learning `ill all wear out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) must go to
school. It'll be hard times for Jacob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Cohen, in a tone of
decision.

<p/>In the wide-open ears of Jacob his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) father's words sounded like a doom,
giving an awful finish to the dirge-like effect of the whole
announcement. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) face had been gathering a wondering incredulous
sorrow at the notion of Mordecai's going away: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was unable to imagine
the change as anything lasting; but at the mention of <div class="bookquote">``hard times for
Jacob''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>there was no further suspense of feeling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) broke forth in
loud lamentation. Adelaide Rebekah always cried when her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebekah</b></font>) brother cried,
and now began to howl with astonishing suddenness, whereupon baby
awaking contributed angry screams, and required to be taken out of the
cradle. A great deal of hushing was necessary, and Mordecai feeling the
cries pierce him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) arms to Jacob, who in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
tears and sobs was turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) head right and left for general
observation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) father, who had been--saying, <div class="bookquote">``Never mind, old man;
you shall go to the riders,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>now released him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) went to Mordecai,
who clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) cheek on the little black head without
speaking. But Cohen, sensible that the master of the family must make
some apology for all this weakness, and that the occasion called for a
speech, addressed Deronda with some elevation of pitch, squaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
elbows and resting a hand on each knee:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not as we're the people to grudge anybody's good luck, sir, or
the portion of their cup being made fuller, as I may say. I'm not an
envious man, and if anybody offered to set up Mordecai in a shop of my
sort two doors lower down, _I_ shouldn't make wry faces about it. I'm
not one of them that had need have a poor opinion of themselves, and be
frightened at anybody else getting a chance. If I'm offal, let a wise
man come and tell me, for I've never heard it yet. And in point of
business, I'm not a class of goods to be in danger. If anybody takes to
rolling me, I can pack myself up like a caterpillar, and find my feet
when I'm let alone. And though, as I may say, you're taking some of our
good works from us, which is property bearing interest, I'm not saying
but we can afford that, though my mother and my wife had the good will
to wish and do for Mordecai to the last; and a Jew must not be like a
servant who works for reward--though I see nothing against a reward if
I can get it. And as to the extra outlay in schooling, I'm neither poor
nor greedy--I wouldn't hang myself for sixpence, nor half a crown
neither. But the truth of it is, the women and children are fond of
Mordecai. You may partly see how it is, sir, by your own sense. A
Jewish man is bound to thank God, day by day, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not made a
woman; but a woman has to thank God that He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) according to
His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will. And we all know what He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--a child-bearing,
tender-hearted thing is the woman of our people. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children are
mostly stout, as I think you'll say Addy's are, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s not mushy,
but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart is tender. So you must excuse present company, sir, for
not being glad all at once. And as to this young lady--for by what you
say `young lady' is the proper term'' (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>--Cohen here threw some additional
emphasis into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) look and tone--<div class="bookquote">``we shall all be glad for Mordecai's
sake by-and-by, when we cast up our accounts and see where we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div><p/>Before Deronda could summon any answer to this oddly mixed speech,
Mordecai exclaimed--

<p/>``Friends, friends! For food and raiment and shelter I would not have
sought better than you have given me. You have sweetened the morsel
with love; and what I thought of as a joy that would be left to me even
in the last months of my waning strength was to go on teaching the lad.
But now I am as one who had clad himself beforehand in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) shroud, and
used himself to making the grave his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) bed, when the divine command
sounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) ears, ``Arise, and go forth; the night is not yet come.<div class="bookquote">''
For no light matter would I have turned away from your kindness to take
another's. But it has been taught us, as you know, that _the reward of
one duty is the power to fulfill another_--so said Ben Azai. You have
made your duty to one of the poor among your brethren a joy to you and
me; and your reward shall be that you will not rest without the joy of
like deeds in the time to come. And may not Jacob come and visit me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai had turned with this question to Deronda, who said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely that can be managed. It is no further than Brompton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Jacob, who had been gradually calmed by the need to hear what was going
forward, began now to see some daylight on the future, the word <div class="bookquote">``visit''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacob</b></font>)</div>having the lively charm of cakes and general relaxation at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
grandfather's, the dealer in knives. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) danced away from Mordecai, and
took up a station of survey in the middle of the hearth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hands
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) knickerbockers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div>said the grandmother, with a sigh of resignation, <div class="bookquote">``I hope
there'll be nothing in the way of your getting _kosher_ meat, Mordecai.
For you'll have to trust to those you live with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the grandmother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right, that's all right, you may be sure, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said
Cohen, as if anxious to cut off inquiry on matters in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) was
uncertain of the guest's position. <div class="bookquote">``So, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) added, turning with a
look of amused enlightenment to Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``it was better than learning
you had to talk to Mordecai about! I wondered to myself at the time. I
thought somehow there was a something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mordecai will perhaps explain to you how it was that I was seeking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had better go, and rising as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
spoke.

<p/>It was agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should come again and the final move be made on
the next day but one; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was going Mordecai begged to walk
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) to the end of the street, and wrapped himself in coat and
comforter. It was a March evening, and Deronda did not mean to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
go far, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) understood the wish to be outside the house with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in
communicative silence, after the exciting speech that had been filling
the last hour. No word was spoken until Deronda had proposed parting,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mirah would wish to thank the Cohens for their goodness. You would
wish her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to do so--to come and see them, would you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai did not answer immediately, but at length said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell. I fear not. There is a family sorrow, and the sight of
my sister might be to them as the fresh bleeding of wounds. There is a
daughter and sister who will never be restored as Mirah is. But who
knows the pathways? We are all of us denying or fulfilling prayers--and
men in their careless deeds walk amidst invisible outstretched arms and
pleadings made in vain. In my ears I have the prayers of generations
past and to come. My life is as nothing to me but the beginning of
fulfilment. And yet I am only another prayer--which you will fulfil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand, and they parted.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you must love him (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) ere to you
He (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) will seem worthy of your love.''
 (<font color='red'><b>WORDSWORTH</b></font>)</div>--WORDSWORTH.


<p/>One might be tempted to envy Deronda providing new clothes for
Mordecai, and pleasing himself as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) were sketching a picture in
imagining the effect of the fine gray flannel shirts and a
dressing-gown very much like a Franciscan's brown frock, with
Mordecai's head and neck above them. Half his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) pleasure was the sense of
seeing Mirah's brother through her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eyes, and securing her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) fervid joy
from any perturbing impression. And yet, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had made all things
ready, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was visited with doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) were not mistaking her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), and
putting the lower effect for the higher: was she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) not just as capable as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) himself had been of feeling the impressive distinction in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
brother all the more for that aspect of poverty which was among the
memorials of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) past? But there were the Meyricks to be propitiated
toward this too Judaic brother; and Deronda detected himself piqued
into getting out of sight everything that might feed the ready
repugnance in minds unblessed with that precious <div class="bookquote">``seeing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>that bathing
of all objects in a solemnity as of sun-set glow, which is begotten of
a loving reverential emotion.

<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) inclination would have been the more confirmed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had heard
the dialogue round Mrs. Meyrick's fire late in the evening, after Mirah
had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) room. Hans, settled now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) Chelsea rooms, had
stayed late, and Mrs. Meyrick, poking the fire into a blaze, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Kate, put out your candle, and all come round the fire cosily.
Hans, dear, do leave off laughing at those poems for the ninety-ninth
time, and come too. I have something wonderful to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if I didn't know that, ma. I have seen it in the corner of your eye
ever so long, and in your pretense of errands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, while the
girls came up to put their feet on the fender, and Hans, pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
chair near them, sat astride it, resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) fists and chin on the back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, if you are so wise, perhaps you know that Mirah's brother
is found!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) clearest accents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, confound it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, in the same moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hans, that is wicked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose we had lost you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _cannot_ help being rather sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``And her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
mother?--where is she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope the brother is not a bad man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor a fellow all smiles and jewelry--a Crystal Palace Assyrian with a
hat on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, in the worst humor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were there ever such unfeeling children?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, a little
strengthened by the need for opposition. <div class="bookquote">``You don't think the least bit
of Mirah's joy in the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, ma, Mirah hardly remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>Crystal</b></font>) brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``People who are lost for twelve years should never come back again,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans. <div class="bookquote">``They are always in the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hans!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">``If you had lost me for
_twenty_ years, I should have thought--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said twelve years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>Hans broke in. <div class="bookquote">``Anywhere about twelve years is
the time at which lost relations should keep out of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but it's nice finding people--there is something to tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said
Mab, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) knees. <div class="bookquote">``Did Prince Camaralzaman find him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mrs. Meyrick, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) neat, narrative way, told all she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) knew
without interruption. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Deronda has the highest admiration for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) ended--<div class="bookquote">``seems quite to look up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) says Mirah is just
the sister to understand this brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Deronda is getting perfectly preposterous about those Jews,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans
with disgust, rising and setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) chair away with a bang. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wants
to do everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) can to encourage Mirah in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) prejudices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for shame, Hans!--to speak in that way of Mr. Deronda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab.
And Mrs. Meyrick's face showed something like an under-current of
expression not allowed to get to the surface.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now we shall never be all together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>Hans went on, walking about
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) hands thrust into the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) brown velveteen coat,
<div class="bookquote">``but we must have this prophet Elijah to tea with us, and Mirah will
think of nothing but sitting on the ruins of Jerusalem. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will be
spoiled as an artist--mind that--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will get as narrow as a nun.
Everything will be spoiled--our home and everything. I shall take to
drinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, really, Hans,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``I do think men are the
most contemptible animals in all creation. Every one of them must have
everything to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) mind, else he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) is unbearable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh, oh, it's very dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>cried Mab. <div class="bookquote">``I feel as if ancient
Nineveh were come again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to know what is the good of having gone to the
university and knowing everything, if you are so childish, Hans,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said
Amy. <div class="bookquote">``You ought to put up with a man that Providence sends you to be
kind to. _We_ shall have to put up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will all of you like the new Lamentations of Jeremiah--`to
be continued in our next'--that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
wide-awake. <div class="bookquote">``It's no use being one thing more than another if one has
to endure the company of those men with a fixed idea, staring blankly
at you, and requiring all your remarks to be small foot-notes to their
text. If you're to be under a petrifying wall, you'd better be an old
boot. I don't feel myself an old boot.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``Good night,
little mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>bending to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brow in a hasty, desperate manner,
and condescendingly, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) way to the door, <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose Mirah knew how you are behaving,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) answer
was a slam of the door. <div class="bookquote">``I _should_ like to see Mirah when Mr. Deronda
tells her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) went on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will look so
beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>But Deronda, on second thoughts, had written a letter, which Mrs.
Meyrick received the next morning, begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) to make the revelation
instead of waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), not giving the real reason--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shrank
from going again through a narrative in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) seemed to be making
himself important and giving himself a character of general
beneficence--but saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wished to remain with Mordecai while
Mrs. Meyrick would bring Mirah on what was to be understood as a visit,
so that there might be a little interval before that change of abode
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) expected that Mirah herself would propose.

<p/>Deronda secretly felt some wondering anxiety how far Mordecai, after
years of solitary preoccupation with ideas likely to have become the
more exclusive from continual diminution of bodily strength, would
allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) to feel a tender interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) sister over and above the
rendering of pious duties. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) feeling for the Cohens, and especially
for little Jacob, showed a persistent activity of affection; but these
objects had entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) daily life for years; and Deronda felt it
noticeable that Mordecai asked no new questions about Mirah,
maintaining, indeed, an unusual silence on all subjects, and appearing
simply to submit to the changes that were coming over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) personal
life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) donned the new clothes obediently, but said afterward to
Deronda, with a faint smile, <div class="bookquote">``I must keep my old garments by me for a
remembrance.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>And when they were seated, awaiting Mirah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) uttered no
word, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyelids closed, but yet showing restless feeling in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face and hands. In fact, Mordecai was undergoing that peculiar
nervous perturbation only known to those whose minds, long and
habitually moving with strong impetus in one current, are suddenly
compelled into a new or reopened channel. Susceptible people, whose
strength has been long absorbed by dormant bias, dread an interview
that imperiously revives the past, as they would dread a threatening
illness. Joy may be there, but joy, too, is terrible.

<p/>Deronda felt the infection of excitement, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) heard the ring at
the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went out, not knowing exactly why, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might see and
greet Mirah beforehand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was startled to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) had on the hat
and cloak in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had first seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>)--the memorable cloak that had
once been wetted for a winding-sheet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) had come down-stairs equipped
in this way; and when Mrs. Meyrick said, in a tone of question, <div class="bookquote">``You
like to go in that dress, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``My brother is poor, and
I want to look as much like him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as I can, else he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) may feel distant from
me'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--imagining that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) should meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in the workman's dress. Deronda
could not make any remark, but felt secretly rather ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own
fastidious arrangements. They shook hands silently, for Mirah looked
pale and awed.

<p/>When Deronda opened the door for her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), Mordecai had risen, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
eyes turned toward it with an eager gaze. Mirah took only two or three
steps, and then stood still. They looked at each other, motionless. It
was less their own presence that they felt than another's; they were
meeting first in memories, compared with which touch was no union.
Mirah was the first to break the silence, standing where she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ezra,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) said, in exactly the same tone as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was telling of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) mother's call to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>).

<p/>Mordecai with a sudden movement advanced and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
shoulders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was the head taller, and looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) tenderly
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``That was our mother's voice. You remember her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) calling
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, and how you answered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--``Mother!'--an<div class="bookquote">'' I knew you loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>Mirah threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) brother's neck, clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) little hands
behind it, and drew down his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face, kissing it with childlike
lavishness, Her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hat fell backward on the ground and disclosed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
curls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, the dear head, the dear head?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, in a low loving
tone, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) thin hand gently on the curls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very ill, Ezra,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, sadly looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) with more
observation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear child, I shall not be long with you in the body,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the
quiet answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I will love you and we will talk to each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, with
a sweet outpouring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) words, as spontaneous as bird-notes. <div class="bookquote">``I will
tell you everything, and you will teach me:--you will teach me to be a
good Jewess--what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have liked me to be. I shall always be with
you when I am not working. For I work now. I shall get money to keep
us. Oh, I have had such good friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah until now had quite forgotten that any one was by, but here she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
turned with the prettiest attitude, keeping one hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) brother's
arm while she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) looked at Mrs. Meyrick and Deronda. The little mother's
happy emotion in witnessing this meeting of brother and sister had
already won her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to Mordecai, who seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) really to have more
dignity and refinement than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had felt obliged to believe in from
Deronda's account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See this dear lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah. <div class="bookquote">``I was a stranger, a poor wanderer,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) believed in me, and has treated me as a daughter. Please give
my brother your hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) added, beseechingly, taking Mrs. Meyrick's
hand and putting it in Mordecai's, then pressing them both with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) own
and lifting them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Eternal Goodness has been with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai. <div class="bookquote">``You have
helped to fulfill our mother's prayer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we will go now, shall we?--and return later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
laying a gentle pressure on Mrs. Meyrick's arm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) immediately
complied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was afraid of any reference to the facts about himself
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had kept back from Mordecai, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) felt no uneasiness now in
the thought of the brother and sister being alone together.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII.

<p/>``Tis hard and ill-paid task to order all things beforehand by the rule
of our own security, as is well hinted by Machiavelli concerning
Caesar Borgia, who, saith he (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>), had thought of all that might occur on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) father's death, and had provided against every evil chance save
only one: it had never come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) mind that when his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) father died,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) own death would quickly follow.


<p/>Grandcourt's importance as a subject of this realm was of the grandly
passive kind which consists in the inheritance of land. Political and
social movements touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) only through the wire of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) rental, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) most careful biographer need not have read up on
Schleswig-Holstein, the policy of Bismarck, trade-unions, household
suffrage, or even the last commercial panic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) glanced over the best
newspaper columns on these topics, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) views on them can hardly be
said to have wanted breadth, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) embraced all Germans, all
commercial men, and all voters liable to use the wrong kind of soap,
under the general epithet of <div class="bookquote">``brutes;''  (<font color='red'><b>all voters</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took no action on these
much-agitated questions beyond looking from under his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyelids at any
man who mentioned them, and retaining a silence which served to shake
the opinions of timid thinkers.

<p/>But Grandcourt, within his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own sphere of interest, showed some of the
qualities which have entered into triumphal diplomacy of the wildest
continental sort.

<p/>No movement of Gwendolen in relation to Deronda escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would
have denied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was jealous; because jealousy would have implied
some doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own power to hinder what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had determined against.
That his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wife should have more inclination to another man's society
than to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own would not pain him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>): what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) required was that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
should be as fully aware as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have been of a locked hand-cuff,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) inclination was helpless to decide anything in contradiction
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) resolve. However much of vacillating whim there might have
been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) entrance on matrimony, there was no vacillating in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
interpretation of the bond. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not repented of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) marriage; it had
really brought more of aim into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life, new objects to exert his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) will
upon; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not repented of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) choice. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) taste was fastidious,
and Gwendolen satisfied it: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would not have liked a wife who had not
received some elevation of rank from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>); nor one who did not command
admiration by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mien and beauty; nor one whose nails were not of the
right shape; nor one the lobe of whose ear was at all too large and
red; nor one who, even if her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nails and ears were right, was at the
same time a ninny, unable to make spirited answers. These requirements
may not seem too exacting to refined contemporaries whose own ability
to fall in love has been held in suspense for lack of indispensable
details; but fewer perhaps may follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) contentment that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
wife should be in a temper which would dispose her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to fly out if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
dared, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should have been urged into marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) by other
feelings than passionate attachment. Still, for those who prefer
command to love, one does not see why the habit of mind should change
precisely at the point of matrimony.

<p/>Grandcourt did not feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had chosen the wrong wife; and having
taken on himself the part of husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not going in any way to be
fooled, or allow himself to be seen in a light that could be regarded
as pitiable. This was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) state of mind--not jealousy; still, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
behavior in some respects was as like jealousy as yellow is to yellow,
which color we know may be the effect of very different causes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had come up to town earlier than usual because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wished to be on
the spot for legal consultation as to the arrangements of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will, the
transference of mortgages, and that transaction with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) uncle about
the succession to Diplow, which the bait of ready money, adroitly
dangled without importunity, had finally won him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to agree upon. But
another acceptable accompaniment of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) being in town was the
presentation of himself with the beautiful bride whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had chosen to
marry in spite of what other people might have expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). It is
true that Grandcourt went about with the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not care a
languid curse for any one's admiration: but this state of not-caring,
just as much as desire, required its related object--namely, a world of
admiring or envying spectators: for if you are fond of looking stonily
at smiling persons--the persons must be and they must smile--a
rudimentary truth which is surely forgotten by those who complain of
mankind as generally contemptible, since any other aspect of the race
must disappoint the voracity of their contempt. Grandcourt, in town for
the first time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wife, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) non-caring abstinence from curses
enlarged and diversified by splendid receptions, by conspicuous rides
and drives, by presentations of himself with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) on all distinguished
occasions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to be sought after; he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) liked that <div class="bookquote">``fellows''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>should be eager to talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and escort her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) within his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) observation;
there was even a kind of lofty coquetry on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) part that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would not
have objected to. But what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not like were her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ways in relation to
Deronda.

<p/>After the musical party at Lady Mallinger's, when Grandcourt had
observed the dialogue on the settee as keenly as Hans had done, it was
characteristic of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) named Deronda for invitation along with
the Mallingers, tenaciously avoiding the possible suggestion to
anybody concerned that Deronda's presence or absence could be of the
least importance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) made no direct observation to Gwendolen
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) behavior that evening, lest the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) disgust should
be a little too strong to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own pride. But a few days
afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) remarked, without being careful of the _à propos_--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing makes a woman more of a gawky than looking out after people
and showing tempers in public. A woman ought to have good manners. Else
it's intolerable to appear with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen made the expected application, and was not without alarm at
the notion of being a gawky. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), too, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) melancholy distaste
for things, preferred that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) distaste should include admirers. But
the sense of overhanging rebuke only intensified the strain of
expectation toward any meeting with Deronda. The novelty and excitement
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) town life was like the hurry and constant change of foreign
travel; whatever might be the inward despondency, there was a programme
to be fulfilled, not without gratification to many-sided self. But, as
always happens with a deep interest, the comparatively rare occasions
on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could exchange any words with Deronda had a diffusive
effect in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consciousness, magnifying their communication with each
other, and therefore enlarging the place she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagined it to have in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
mind. How could Deronda help this? He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) certainly did not avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>);
rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wished to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) by every delicate indirect means that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not been indiscreet since it had not lowered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) respect. Moreover he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) liked being near her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--how could it be
otherwise? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was something more than a problem: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was a lovely
woman, for the turn of whose mind and fate he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had a care which, however
futile it might be, kept soliciting him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as a responsibility, perhaps
all the more that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) dared to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own future, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw it
lying far away from this splendid sad-hearted creature, who, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
had once been impelled to arrest her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) attention momentarily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might
have seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arm with warning to hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from stepping where
there was danger, had turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with a beseeching persistent need.

<p/>One instance in which Grandcourt stimulated a feeling in Gwendolen that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would have liked to suppress without seeming to care about it, had
relation to Mirah. Gwendolen's inclination lingered over the project of
the singing lessons as a sort of obedience to Deronda's advice, but day
followed day with that want of perceived leisure which belongs to lives
where there is no work to mark off intervals; and the continual
liability to Grandcourt's presence and surveillance seemed to flatten
every effort to the level of the boredom which his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) manner expressed;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) negative mind was as diffusive as fog, clinging to all objects, and
spoiling all contact.

<p/>But one morning when they were breakfasting, Gwendolen, in a recurrent
fit of determination to exercise the old spirit, said, dallying
prettily over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) prawns without eating them--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think of making myself accomplished while we are in town, and having
singing lessons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, languidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>echoed Gwendolen, playing at sauciness; <div class="bookquote">``because I can't eat
_pâté de foie gras_ to make me sleepy, and I can't smoke, and I can't
go to the club to make me like to come away again--I want a variety of
_ennui_. What would be the most convenient time, when you are busy with
your lawyers and people, for me to have lessons from that little
Jewess, whose singing is getting all the rage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, pushing away his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) plate, and
leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) chair while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) most
lizard-like expression and, played with the ears of the tiny spaniel on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lap -LRB-Gwendolen had taken a dislike to the dogs because they fawned
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)-RRB-.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, languidly, <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why a lady should sing. Amateurs
make fools of themselves. A lady can't risk herself in that way in
company. And one doesn't want to hear squalling in private.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like frankness: that seems to me a husband's great charm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) little upward movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chin, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and lifting a prawn before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), looked at the
boiled ingenuousness of its eyes as preferable to the lizard's. <div class="bookquote">``But;''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) added, having devoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mortification, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you don't
object to Miss Lapidoth's singing at our party on the fourth? I thought
of engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>). Lady Brackenshaw had her (<font color='blue'><b>Brackenshaw</b></font>), you know: and the Raymonds,
who are very particular about their music. And Mr. Deronda, who is a
musician himself and a first-rate judge, says there is no singing in
such good taste as hers for a drawing-room. I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) opinion is an
authority.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meant to sling a small stone at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband in that way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very indecent of Deronda to go about praising that girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt in a tone of indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indecent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Gwendolen, reddening and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) again,
overcome by startled wonder, and unable to reflect on the probable
falsity of the phrase--<div class="bookquote">``to go about praising.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is patronized by Lady Mallinger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ought
to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tongue about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Men can see what is his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Men who judge of others by themselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, turning white
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) redness, and immediately smitten with a dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own
words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course. And a woman should take their judgment--else she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is likely
to run her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head into the wrong place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, conscious of
using pinchers on that white creature. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you take Deronda for
a saint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, summoning desperately her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) almost
miraculous power of self-control, and speaking in a high hard tone.
<div class="bookquote">``Only a little less of a monster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rose, pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chair away without hurry, and walked out of the
room with something like the care of a man who is afraid of showing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has taken more wine than usual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned the keys inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
dressing-room doors, and sat down for some time looking pale and quiet
as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was leaving the breakfast-room. Even in the moments after
reading the poisonous letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had hardly had more cruel sensations
than now; for emotion was at the acute point, where it is not
distinguishable from sensation. Deronda unlike what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had believed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to be, was an image which affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as a hideous apparition
would have done, quite apart from the way in which it was produced. It
had taken hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as pain before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could consider whether it were
fiction or truth; and further to hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power of resistance came
the sudden perception, how very slight were the grounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) faith in
Deronda--how little she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life--how childish she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) confidence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rebukes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) severity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began to seem
odious, along with all the poetry and lofty doctrine in the world,
whatever it might be; and the grave beauty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face seemed the most
unpleasant mask that the common habits of men could put on.

<p/>All this went on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with the rapidity of a sick dream; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
start into resistance was very much like a waking. Suddenly from out
the gray sombre morning there came a stream of sunshine, wrapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
in warmth and light where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sat in stony stillness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) moved gently
and looked round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--there was a world outside this bad dream, and the
dream proved nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rose, stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arms upward and clasping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) habitual attitude when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was seeking relief from
oppressive feeling, and walked about the room in this flood of sunbeams.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not true! What does it matter whether _he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)_ believes it or not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) repeated to herself--but this was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) faith come
back again; it was only the desperate cry of faith, finding suffocation
intolerable. And how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) go on through the day in this state?
With one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) impetuous alternations, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination flew to wild
actions by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would convince herself of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wished: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
would go to Lady Mallinger and question her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) about Mirah; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would
write to Deronda and upbraid him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with making the world all false and
wicked and hopeless to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dared pour out all the bitter
indignation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart. No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would go to Mirah. This last form
taken by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) need was more definitely practicable, and quickly became
imperious. No matter what came of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had the pretext of asking
Mirah to sing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) party on the fourth. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) going to say
beside? How satisfy? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not foresee--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not wait to
foresee. If that idea which was maddening her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been a living thing,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have wanted to throttle it without waiting to foresee what
would come of the act. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rang her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) bell and asked if Mr. Grandcourt
were gone out: finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ordered the carriage, and began
to dress for the drive; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went down, and walked about the large
drawing-room like an imprisoned dumb creature, not recognizing herself
in the glass panels, not noting any object around her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in the painted
gilded prison. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband would probably find out where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been,
and punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in some way or other--no matter--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could neither
desire nor fear anything just now but the assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not
been deluding herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) trust.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was provided with Mirah's address. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was on the way with all
the fine equipage necessary to carry about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) poor uneasy heart,
depending in its palpitations on some answer or other to questioning
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should put. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was as heedless of what
happened before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found that Miss Lapidoth was at home, as one is of
lobbies and passages on the way to a court of justice--heedless of
everything till she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) was in a room where there were folding-doors, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) heard Deronda's voice behind it. Doubtless the identification was
helped by forecast, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) was as certain of it as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) had seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) was frightened at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) own agitation, and began to unbutton her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
gloves that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) might button them again, and bite her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) lips over the
pretended difficulty, while the door opened, and Mirah presented
herself with perfect quietude and a sweet smile of recognition. There
was relief in the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) face, and Gwendolen was able to smile in
return, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand in silence; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seated
herself, all the while hearing the voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt some reflux of
energy in the confused sense that the truth could not be anything that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dreaded. Mirah drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chair very near, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt that the
sound of the conversation should be subdued, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) visitor
with placid expectation, while Gwendolen began in a low tone, with
something that seemed like bashfulness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you wonder to see me--perhaps I ought to have written--but I
wished to make a particular request.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to see you instead of having a letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah,
wondering at the changed expression and manner of the <div class="bookquote">``Vandyke
duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>as Hans had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to call Gwendolen. The rich color and
the calmness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own face were in strong contrast with the pale
agitated beauty under the plumed hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen went on--<div class="bookquote">``at least I hoped, you would not object
to sing at our house on the 4th--in the evening--at a party like Lady
Brackenshaw's. I should be so much obliged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very happy to sing for you. At ten?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, while
Gwendolen seemed to get more instead of less embarrassed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At ten, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) answered; then paused, and felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
nothing more to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not go. It was impossible to rise and
say good-bye. Deronda's voice was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) must say it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could contrive no other sentence--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Deronda is in the next room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) former tone. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is reading Hebrew with my
brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, who had heard this from Lady
Mallinger, but had not minded it then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a dear brother who is ill-consumptive, and Mr. Deronda is the
best of friends to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) has been to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, with the
impulse that will not let us pass the mention of a precious person
indifferently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand on Mirah's, and speaking
hardly above a whisper--<div class="bookquote">``tell me--tell me the truth. You are sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is
quite good. You know no evil of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). Any evil that people say of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is
false.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Could the proud-spirited woman have behaved more like a child? But the
strange words penetrated Mirah with nothing but a sense of solemnity
and indignation. With a sudden light in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes and a tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are the people that say evil of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)? I would not believe any evil
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), if an angel came to tell it me. He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) found me when I was so
miserable--I was going to drown myself; I looked so poor and forsaken;
you would have thought I was a beggar by the wayside. And he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) treated me
as if I had been a king's daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) took me to the best of women. He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)
found my brother for me. And he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) honors my brother--though he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) too was
poor--oh, almost as poor as he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) could be. And my brother honors him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
That is no light thing to say'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--here Mirah's tone changed to one of
profound emphasis, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head backward: <div class="bookquote">``for my brother is
very learned and great-minded. And Mr. Deronda says there are few men
equal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Some Jewish defiance had flamed into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) indignant
gratitude and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anger could not help including Gwendolen since she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
seemed to have doubted Deronda's goodness.

<p/>But Gwendolen was like one parched with thirst, drinking the fresh
water that spreads through the frame as a sufficient bliss. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not
notice that Mirah was angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not distinctly conscious
of anything but of the penetrating sense that Deronda and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life were
no more like her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's conception than the morning in the horizon
was like the morning mixed with street gas. Even Mirah's words sank
into the indefiniteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) relief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could hardly have repeated
them, or said how her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) whole state of feeling was changed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pressed
Mirah's hand, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>in a hurried whisper,
then rose, and added, with only a hazy consciousness, <div class="bookquote">``I must go, I
shall see you--on the fourth--I am so much obliged'' (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>--bowing herself out
automatically, while Mirah, opening the door for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), wondered at what
seemed a sudden retreat into chill loftiness.

<p/>Gwendolen, indeed, had no feeling to spare in any effusiveness toward
the creature who had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) relief. The passionate need of
contradiction to Grandcourt's estimate of Deronda, a need which had
blunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sensibility to everything else, was no sooner satisfied
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wanted to be gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began to be aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was out of
place, and to dread Deronda's seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). And once in the carriage
again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had the vision of what awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) at home. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) drew up
before the door in Grosvenor Square, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband was arriving with a
cigar between his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fingers. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) threw it away and handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) out,
accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) up-stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned into the drawing-room, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
should follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) farther and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) no place to retreat to; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
sat down with a weary air, taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gloves, rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) forehead, and making his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presence as much of a cipher as possible.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sat, too, and not far from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--just in front, where to avoid
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must have the emphasis of effort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask where you have been at this extraordinary hour?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; I have been to Miss Lapidoth's, to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) to come and sing
for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gloves on the little table beside
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and looking down at them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) relations with Deronda?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt,
with the coldest possible sneer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) low voice which in poor
Gwendolen's ear was diabolical.

<p/>For the first time since their marriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) flashed out upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
without inward check. Turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes full on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, in a
biting tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and what you said is false--a low, wicked falsehood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) told you so--did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>returned Grandcourt, with a more thoroughly
distilled sneer.

<p/>Gwendolen was mute. The daring anger within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was turned into the
rage of dumbness. What reasons for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) belief could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) give? All the
reasons that seemed so strong and living within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw them
suffocated and shrivelled up under her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's breath. There was no
proof to give, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own impression, which would seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own
folly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head quickly away from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and looked angrily
toward the end of the room: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have risen, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) way.

<p/>Grandcourt saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) advantage. <div class="bookquote">``It's of no consequence so far as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
singing goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) superficial drawl. <div class="bookquote">``You can have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) to
sing, if you like.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then, after a pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) added in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lowest
imperious tone, <div class="bookquote">``But you will please to observe that you are not to go
near that house again. As my wife, you must take my word about what is
proper for you. When you undertook to be Mrs. Grandcourt, you undertook
not to make a fool of yourself. You have been making a fool of yourself
this morning; and if you were to go on as you have begun, you might
soon get yourself talked of at the clubs in a way you would not like.
What do _you_ know about the world? You have married _me_, and must be
guided by my opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Every slow sentence of that speech had a terrific mastery in it for
Gwendolen's nature. If the low tones had come from a physician telling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) symptoms were those of a fatal disease, and
prognosticating its course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not have been more helpless
against the argument that lay in it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was permitted to move now,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband never again made any reference to what had occurred
this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own words. If this white-handed
man with the perpendicular profile had been sent to govern a difficult
colony, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might have won reputation among his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) contemporaries. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
certainly ability, would have understood that it was safer to
exterminate than to cajole superseded proprietors, and would not have
flinched from making things safe in that way.

<p/>Gwendolen did not, for all this, part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) recovered
faith;--rather, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) kept it with a more anxious tenacity, as a
Protestant of old kept his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bible hidden or a Catholic his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) crucifix,
according to the side favored by the civil arm; and it was
characteristic of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that apart from the impression gained concerning
Deronda in that visit, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination was little occupied with Mirah
or the eulogised brother. The one result established for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was, that
Deronda had acted simply as a generous benefactor, and the phrase
<div class="bookquote">``reading Hebrew''  (<font color='red'><b>a benefactor</b></font>)</div>had fleeted unimpressively across her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sense of
hearing, as a stray stork might have made its peculiar flight across
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) landscape without rousing any surprised reflection on its natural
history.

<p/>But the issue of that visit, as it regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband, took a
strongly active part in the process which made an habitual conflict
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and was the cause of some external change perhaps not
observed by any one except Deronda. As the weeks went on bringing
occasional transient interviews with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) perceived
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) an intensifying of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) superficial hardness and resolute
display, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) abrupt betrayals of agitation the more marked
and disturbing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/>In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was undergoing a sort of discipline for the refractory
which, as little as possible like conversion, bends half the self with
a terrible strain, and exasperates the unwillingness of the other half.
Grandcourt had an active divination rather than discernment of
refractoriness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and what had happened about Mirah quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
suspicion that there was an increase of it dependent on the occasions
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) happened to see Deronda: there was some <div class="bookquote">``confounded nonsense''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>between them: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) did not imagine it exactly as flirtation, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
imagination in other branches was rather restricted; but it was
nonsense that evidently kept up a kind of simmering in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind--an
inward action which might become disagreeable outward. Husbands in the
old time are known to have suffered from a threatening devoutness in
their wives, presenting itself first indistinctly as oddity, and ending
in that mild form of lunatic asylum, a nunnery: Grandcourt had a vague
perception of threatening moods in Gwendolen which the unity between
them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) views of marriage required him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) peremptorily to check. Among
the means he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) chose, one was peculiar, and was less ably calculated than
the speeches we have just heard.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should know the main purport of the will he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was
making, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could not communicate this himself, because it involved
the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) relation to Mrs. Glasher and her (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) children; and that
there should be any overt recognition of this between Gwendolen and
himself was supremely repugnant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). Like all proud, closely-wrapped
natures, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) shrank from explicitness and detail, even on trivialities,
if they were personal: a valet must maintain a strict reserve with him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>)
on the subject of shoes and stockings. And clashing was intolerable to
him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) habitual want was to put collision out of the question by the
quiet massive pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) rule. But he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) wished Gwendolen to know
that before he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) an offer it was no secret to him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) relations with Lydia, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) previous knowledge being the
apology for bringing the subject before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) now. Some men in his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) place
might have thought of writing what he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) to know, in the form
of a letter. But Grandcourt hated writing: even writing a note was a
bore to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had long been accustomed to have all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) writing
done by Lush. We know that there are persons who will forego their own
obvious interest rather than do anything so disagreeable as to write
letters; and it is not probable that these imperfect utilitarians would
rush into manuscript and syntax on a difficult subject in order to save
another's feelings. To Grandcourt it did not even occur that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should,
would, or could write to Gwendolen the information in question; and the
only medium of communication he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could use was Lush, who, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mind,
was as much of an implement as pen and paper. But here too Grandcourt
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) reserves, and would not have uttered a word likely to encourage
Lush in an impudent sympathy with any supposed grievance in a marriage
which had been discommended by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). Who that has a confidant escapes
believing too little in his (<font color='blue'><b>confidant</b></font>) penetration, and too much in his (<font color='blue'><b>confidant</b></font>)
discretion? Grandcourt had always allowed Lush to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) external
affairs indiscriminately--irregularities, debts, want of ready money;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had only used discrimination about what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) confidant
to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had been so accustomed to this human tool, that
the having him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) at call in London was a recovery of lost ease. It
followed that Lush knew all the provisions of the will more exactly
than they were known to the testator himself.

<p/>Grandcourt did not doubt that Gwendolen, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was a woman who
could put two and two together, knew or suspected Lush to be the
contriver of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) interview with Lydia, and that this was the reason why
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) first request was for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) banishment. But the bent of a woman's
inferences on mixed subjects which excites mixed passions is not
determined by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) capacity for simple addition; and here Grandcourt
lacked the only organ of thinking that could have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) from
mistake--namely, some experience of the mixed passions concerned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
had correctly divined one-half of Gwendolen's dread--all that related
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) personal pride, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) perception that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) will must conquer
hers; but the remorseful half, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had known of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) broken
promise, was as much out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) imagination as the other side of the
moon. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to feel about Lydia was solely a tongue-tied
jealousy, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) believed Lydia to have written with the jewels
was the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had once been used to wearing them, with other
amenities such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) imputed to the intercourse with jealous women. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
had the triumphant certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could aggravate the jealousy and
yet smite it with a more absolute dumbness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) object was to engage
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wife's egoism on the same side as his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
employment of Lush he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not intend an insult to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ought to
understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was the only possible envoy. Grandcourt's view of
things was considerably fenced in by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) general sense, that what
suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) others must put up with. There is no escaping the fact that
want of sympathy condemns us to corresponding stupidity. Mephistopheles
thrown upon real life, and obliged to manage his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own plots, would
inevitably make blunders.

<p/>One morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) went to Gwendolen in the boudoir beyond the back
drawing-room, hat and gloves in hand, and said with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) best-tempered,
most persuasive drawl, standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and looking down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sat with a book on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lap--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A--Gwendolen, there's some business about property to be explained. I
have told Lush to come and explain it to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) knows all about these
things. I am going out. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) can come up now. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s the only person who
can explain. I suppose you'll not mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that I do mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, angrily, starting up. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall not see him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) showed the intention to dart away to the door.
Grandcourt was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) back toward it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was prepared for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) anger, and showed none in return, saying, with the same sort of
remonstrant tone that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) might have used about an objection to dining
out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use making a fuss. There are plenty of brutes in the world
that one has to talk to. People with any _savoir vivre_ don't make a
fuss about such things. Some business must be done. You can't expect
agreeable people to do it. If I employ Lush, the proper thing for you
is to take it as a matter of course. Not to make a fuss about it. Not
to toss your head and bite your lips about people of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The drawling and the pauses with which this speech was uttered gave
time for crowding reflections in Gwendolen, quelling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resistance.
What was there to be told her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) about property? This word had certain
dominant associations for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), first with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, then with Mrs.
Glasher and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) children. What would be the use if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) refused to see
Lush? Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ask Grandcourt to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) himself? That might be
intolerable, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) consented, which it was certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would not,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mind to the contrary. The humiliation of standing
an obvious prisoner, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband barring the door, was not to be
borne any longer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned away to lean against a cabinet, while
Grandcourt again moved toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have arranged for Lush to come up now, while I am out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said,
after a long organ stop, during which Gwendolen made no sign. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet another pause before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could say <div class="bookquote">``Yes'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face turned obliquely
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes cast down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall come back in time to ride, if you like to get ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said
Grandcourt. No answer. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is in a desperate rage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). But
the rage was silent, and therefore not disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). It followed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chin and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) still kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
eyelids down, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not move them until he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was on the other side
of the door.

<p/>What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to do? Search where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consciousness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
found no plea to justify a plaint. Any romantic illusions she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had had
in marrying this man had turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power of using him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) liked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was using her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sat awaiting the announcement of Lush as a sort of searing
operation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had to go through. The facts that galled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
gathered a burning power when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought of their lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.
It was all a part of that new gambling, in which the losing was not
simply a _minus_, but a terrible _plus_ that had never entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
reckoning.

<p/>Lush was neither quite pleased nor quite displeased with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) task.
Grandcourt had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) by way of conclusion, <div class="bookquote">``Don't make yourself
more disagreeable than nature obliges you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>thought Lush. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I will write a brief
abstract for Mrs. Grandcourt to read.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not suggest that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
should make the whole communication in writing, which was a proof that
the interview did not wholly displease him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/>Some provision was being made for himself in the will, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had no
reason to be in a bad humor, even if a bad humor had been common with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was perfectly convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had penetrated all the secrets
of the situation; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had no diabolical delight in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had only
the small movements of gratified self-loving resentment in discerning
that this marriage had fulfilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own foresight in not being as
satisfactory as the supercilious young lady had expected it to be, and
as Grandcourt wished to feign that it was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had no persistent spite
much stronger than what gives the seasoning of ordinary scandal to
those who repeat it and exaggerate it by their conjectures. With no
active compassion or good-will, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had just as little active
malevolence, being chiefly occupied in liking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) particular pleasures,
and not disliking anything but what hindered those
pleasures--everything else ranking with the last murder and the last
_opéra bouffe_, under the head of things to talk about. Nevertheless,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was not indifferent to the prospect of being treated uncivilly by a
beautiful woman, or to the counter-balancing fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) present
commission put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hands an official power of humiliating her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
did not mean to use it needlessly; but there are some persons so gifted
in relation to us that their <div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>some persons</b></font>)</div>seems charged with
offense.

<p/>By the time that Mr. Lush was announced, Gwendolen had braced herself
to a bitter resolve that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) should not witness the slightest betrayal
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feeling, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) might have to tell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) to sit
down with stately quietude. After all, what was this man to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
not in the least like her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power of hating a coarse,
familiar-mannered man, with clumsy hands, was now relaxed by the
intensity with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contrast.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held a small paper folded in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need hardly say that I should not have presented myself if Mr.
Grandcourt had not expressed a strong wish to that effect--as no doubt
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) has mentioned to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>From some voices that speech might have sounded entirely reverential,
and even timidly apologetic. Lush had no intention to the contrary, but
to Gwendolen's ear his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words had as much insolence in them as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
prominent eyes, and the pronoun <div class="bookquote">``you''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>was too familiar. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to
have addressed the folding-screen, and spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as Mrs. Grandcourt.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gave the smallest sign of a bow, and Lush went on, with a little
awkwardness, getting entangled in what is elegantly called tautology.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My having been in Mr. Grandcourt's confidence for fifteen years or
more--since he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was a youth, in fact--of course gives me a peculiar
position. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) can speak to me of affairs that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could not mention to
any one else; and, in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could not have employed any one else in
this affair. I have accepted the task out of friendship for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). Which
is my apology for accepting the task--if you would have preferred some
one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paused, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) made no sign, and Lush, to give himself a
countenance in an apology which met no acceptance, opened the folded
paper, and looked at it vaguely before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) began to speak again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This paper contains some information about Mr. Grandcourt's will, an
abstract of a part he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wished you to know--if you'll be good enough to
cast your eyes over it. But there is something I had to say by way of
introduction--which I hope you'll pardon me for, if it's not quite
agreeable.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lush found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) was behaving better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) had
expected, and had no idea how insulting he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) made himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``not
quite agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say what you have to say without apologizing, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
with the air she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might have bestowed on a dog-stealer come to claim a
reward for finding the dog he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) had stolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only to remind you of something that occurred before your
engagement to Mr. Grandcourt,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Lush, not without the rise of some
willing insolence in exchange for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) scorn. <div class="bookquote">``You met a lady in Cardell
Chase, if you remember, who spoke to you of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) position with regard to
Mr. Grandcourt. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had children with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--one a very fine boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen's lips were almost as pale as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cheeks; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) passion had no
weapons--words were no better than chips. This man's speech was like a
sharp knife-edge drawn across her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) skin: but even her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) indignation at the
employment of Lush was getting merged in a crowd of other feelings, dim
and alarming as a crowd of ghosts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grandcourt was aware that you were acquainted with this
unfortunate affair beforehand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) thinks it only right that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
position and intentions should be made quite clear to you. It is an
affair of property and prospects; and if there were any objection you
had to make, if you would mention it to me--it is a subject which of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would rather not speak about himself--if you will be good
enough just to read this.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>With the last words Lush rose and presented
the paper to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/>When Gwendolen resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would betray no feeling in the
presence of this man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not prepared herself to hear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
husband knew the silent consciousness, the silently accepted terms on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had married him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dared not raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand to take the
paper, least it should visibly tremble. For a moment Lush stood holding
it toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gaze on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as ignominy, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could say even with low-toned haughtiness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lay it on the table. And go into the next room, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lush obeyed, thinking as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took an easy-chair in the back
drawing-room, <div class="bookquote">``My lady winces considerably. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) didn't know what would
be the charge for that superfine article, Henleigh Grandcourt.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But it
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that a penniless girl had done better than she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had any
right to expect, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been uncommonly knowing for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) years
and opportunities: her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) words to Lydia meant nothing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) running
away had probably been part of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) adroitness. It had turned out a
master-stroke.

<p/>Meanwhile Gwendolen was rallying her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nerves to the reading of the
paper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) must read it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) whole being--pride, longing for rebellion,
dreams of freedom, remorseful conscience, dread of fresh
visitation--all made one need to know what the paper contained. But at
first it was not easy to take in the meaning of the words. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
succeeded, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found that in the case of there being no son as issue of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) marriage, Grandcourt had made the small Henleigh his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) heir; that was
all she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cared to extract from the paper with any distinctness. The
other statement as to what provision would be made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in the same
case, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hurried over, getting only a confused perception of thousands
and Gadsmere. It was enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could dismiss the man in the next room
with the defiant energy which had revived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) at the idea that this
question of property and inheritance was meant as a finish to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
humiliations and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thraldom.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thrust the paper between the leaves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) book, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) took in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand, and walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stateliest air into the next room, where
Lush immediately arose, awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) approach. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was four yards
from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), it was hardly an instant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) paused to say in a high
tone, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) swept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyelashes--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell Mr. Grandcourt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) arrangements are just what I
desired'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--passing on without haste, and leaving Lush time to mingle
some admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) graceful back with that half-amused sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
spirit and impertinence, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expressed by raising his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyebrows and
just thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really did not want her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
to be worse punished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was glad to think that it was time to go
and lunch at the club, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant to have a lobster salad.

<p/>What did Gwendolen look forward to? When her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband returned he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) equipped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) riding-dress, ready to ride out with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
not again going to be hysterical, or take to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) bed and say she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
ill. That was the implicit resolve adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) muscles before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could have framed it in words, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) walked out of the room, leaving
Lush behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was going to act in the spirit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) message, and
not to give herself time to reflect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rang the bell for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) maid,
and went with the usual care through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) change of toilet. Doubtless
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband had meant to produce a great effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): by-and-by
perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) see an effect the very opposite of what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
intended; but at present all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could show was a defiant
satisfaction in what had been presumed to be disagreeable. It came as
an instinct rather than a thought, that to show any sign which could be
interpreted as jealousy, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had just been insultingly reminded
that the conditions were what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had accepted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes open,
would be the worst self-humiliation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
not time to-day to be clear about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) future actions; all she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could be
clear about was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would match her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband in ignoring any ground
for excitement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) not only rode, but went out with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to dine,
contributing nothing to alter their mutual manner, which was never that
of rapid interchange in discourse; and curiously enough she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rejected a
handkerchief on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) maid had by mistake put the wrong scent--a
scent that Grandcourt had once objected to. Gwendolen would not have
liked to be an object of disgust to this husband whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hated: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
liked all disgust to be on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) side.

<p/>But to defer thought in this way was something like trying to talk
without singing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own ears. The thought that is bound up with our
passion is as penetrative as air--everything is porous to it; bows,
smiles, conversation, repartee, are mere honeycombs where such thoughts
rushes freely, not always with a taste of honey. And without shutting
herself up in any solitude, Gwendolen seemed at the end of nine or ten
hours to have gone through a labyrinth of reflection, in which already
the same succession of prospects had been repeated, the same fallacious
outlets rejected, the same shrinking from the necessities of every
course. Already she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was undergoing some hardening effect from feeling
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was under eyes which saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) past actions solely in the light
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lowest motives. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lived back in the scenes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) courtship,
with the new bitter consciousness of what had been in Grandcourt's
mind--certain now, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) present experience of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a
peculiar triumph in conquering her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dumb repugnance, and that ever since
their marriage he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had had a cold exultation in knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fancied
secret. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination exaggerated every tyrannical impulse he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
capable of. <div class="bookquote">``I will insist on being separated from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) first
darting determination; then, <div class="bookquote">``I will leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) consents or
not. If this boy becomes his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heir, I have made an atonement.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But
neither in darkness nor in daylight could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagine the scenes which
must carry out those determinations with the courage to feel them
endurable. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) run away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own family--carry distress
among them, and render herself an object of scandal in the society she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had left behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)? What future lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as Mrs. Grandcourt gone
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, who would be made destitute again by the rupture of
the marriage for which one chief excuse had been that it had brought
that mother a maintenance? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had lately been seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uncle and
Anna in London, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been saved from any difficulty about
inviting them to stay in Grosvenor Square by their wish to be with Rex,
who would not risk a meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), the transient visit she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had had
from them helped now in giving stronger color to the picture of what it
would be for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to take refuge in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own family. What could she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) say
to justify her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flight? Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uncle would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to go back. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother
would cry. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) aunt and Anna would look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with wondering alarm.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband would have power to compel her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had absolutely nothing
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could allege against him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in judicious or judicial ears. And to
<div class="bookquote">``insist on separation!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That was an easy combination of words; but
considered as an action to be executed against Grandcourt, it would be
about as practicable as to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) a pliant disposition and a dread of
other people's unwillingness. How was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to begin? What was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to say
that would not be a condemnation of herself? <div class="bookquote">``If I am to have misery
anyhow,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the bitter refrain of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rebellious dreams, <div class="bookquote">``I had better
have the misery that I can keep to myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Moreover, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) capability of
rectitude told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again and again that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no right to complain of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) contract, or to withdraw from it.

<p/>And always among the images that drove her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back to submission was
Deronda. The idea of herself separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, gave Deronda a
changed, perturbing, painful place in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) consciousness: instinctively
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt that the separation would be from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) too, and in the
prospective vision of herself as a solitary, dubiously-regarded woman,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt some tingling bashfulness at the remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) behavior
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). The association of Deronda with a dubious position for
herself was intolerable. And what would he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) say if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) knew everything?
Probably that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought to bear what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had brought on herself, unless
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could make herself a better woman by taking any
other course. And what sort of woman was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be--solitary, sickened
of life, looked at with a suspicious kind of pity?--even if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could
dream of success in getting that dreary freedom. Mrs. Grandcourt <div class="bookquote">``run
away''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grandcourt</b></font>)</div>would be a more pitiable creature than Gwendolen Harleth
condemned to teach the bishop's daughters, and to be inspected by Mrs.
Mompert.

<p/>One characteristic trait in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) conduct is worth mentioning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) would
not look a second time at the paper Lush had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>); and before
ringing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) maid she (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) locked it up in a traveling-desk which was at
hand, proudly resolved against curiosity about what was allotted to
herself in connection with Gadsmere--feeling herself branded in the
minds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mompert</b></font>) husband and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) confidant with the meanness that would
accept marriage and wealth on any conditions, however dishonorable and
humiliating.

<p/>Day after day the same pattern of thinking was repeated. There came
nothing to change the situation--no new elements in the sketch--only a
recurrence which engraved it. The May weeks went on into June, and
still Mrs. Grandcourt was outwardly in the same place, presenting
herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was expected to do in the accustomed scenes, with the
accustomed grace, beauty, and costume; from church at one end of the
week, through all the scale of desirable receptions, to opera at the
other. Church was not markedly distinguished in her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mind from the other
forms of self-presentation, for marriage had included no instruction
that enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to connect liturgy and sermon with any larger order of
the world than that of unexplained and perhaps inexplicable social
fashions. While a laudable zeal was laboring to carry the light of
spiritual law up the alleys where law is chiefly known as the
policeman, the brilliant Mrs. Grandcourt, condescending a little to a
fashionable rector and conscious of a feminine advantage over a learned
dean, was, so far as pastoral care and religious fellowship were
concerned, in as complete a solitude as a man in a lighthouse.

<p/>Can we wonder at the practical submission which hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) constructive
rebellion? The combination is common enough, as we know from the number
of persons who make us aware of it in their own case by a clamorous
unwearied statement of the reasons against their submitting to a
situation which, on inquiry, we discover to be the least disagreeable
within their reach. Poor Gwendolen had both too much and too little
mental power and dignity to make herself exceptional. No wonder that
Deronda now marked some hardening in a look and manner which were
schooled daily to the suppression of feeling.

<p/>For example. One morning, riding in Rotten Row with Grandcourt by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw standing against the railing at the turn, just facing
them, a dark-eyed lady with a little girl and a blonde boy, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at
once recognized as the beings in all the world the most painful for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
to behold. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and Grandcourt had just slackened their pace to a walk;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) being on the outer side was the nearer to the unwelcome vision, and
Gwendolen had not presence of mind to do anything but glance away from
the dark eyes that met hers piercingly toward Grandcourt, who wheeled
past the group with an unmoved face, giving no sign of recognition.

<p/>Immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt a rising rage against him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mingling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) shame
for herself, and the words, <div class="bookquote">``You might at least have raised your hat to
her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>flew impetuously to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips--but did not pass them. If as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
husband, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) company, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chose to ignore these creatures whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
herself had excluded from the place she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was filling, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) be
the person to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was dumb.

<p/>It was not chance, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own design, that had brought Mrs. Glasher
there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) boy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had come to town under the pretext of making
purchases--really wanting educational apparatus for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) children, and
had had interviews with Lush in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not refused to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
uneasy mind by representing the probabilities as all on the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
ultimate triumph. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) keep quiet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might live to see the
marriage dissolve itself in one way or other--Lush hinted at several
ways--leaving the succession assured to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) boy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had had an
interview with Grandcourt, too, who had as usual told her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to behave
like a reasonable woman, and threatened punishment if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were
troublesome; but had, also as usual, vindicated himself from any wish
to be stingy, the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was receiving from Sir Hugo on account of
Diplow encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to be lavish. Lydia, feeding on the
probabilities in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) favor, devoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) helpless wrath along with that
pleasanter nourishment; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) discretion go
entirely without the reward of making a Medusa-apparition before
Gwendolen, vindictiveness and jealousy finding relief in an outlet of
venom, though it were as futile as that of a viper already flung on the
other side of the hedge. Hence, each day, after finding out from Lush
the likely time for Gwendolen to be riding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had watched at that
post, daring Grandcourt so far. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) not take little Henleigh
into the Park?

<p/>The Medusa-apparition was made effective beyond Lydia's conception by
the shock it gave Gwendolen actually to see Grandcourt ignoring this
woman who had once been the nearest in the world to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), along with the
children she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had borne him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). And all the while the dark shadow thus cast
on the lot of a woman destitute of acknowledged social dignity, spread
itself over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) visions of a future that might be her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own, and made
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dread on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own behalf. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shrank all the more from any
lonely action. What possible release could there be for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from this
hated vantage ground, which yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dared not quit, any more than if
fire had been raining outside it? What release, but death? Not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
death. Gwendolen was not a woman who could easily think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own
death as a near reality, or front for herself the dark entrance on the
untried and invisible. It seemed more possible that Grandcourt should
die:--and yet not likely. The power of tyranny in him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) seemed a power of
living in the presence of any wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should die. The thought that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) death was the only possible deliverance for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was one with the
thought that deliverance would never come--the double deliverance from
the injury with which other beings might reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and from the yoke
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had brought on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own neck. No! she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) foresaw him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) always living, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own life dominated by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>); the <div class="bookquote">``always''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) young experience not
stretching beyond the few immediate years that seemed immeasurably long
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) passionate weariness. The thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) dying would not
subsist: it turned as with a dream-change into the terror that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
should die with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) throttling fingers on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck avenging that
thought. Fantasies moved within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) like ghosts, making no break in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
more acknowledged consciousness and finding no obstruction in it: dark
rays doing their work invisibly in the broad light.

<p/>Only an evening or two after that encounter in the Park, there was a
grand concert at Klesmer's, who was living rather magnificently now in
one of the large houses in Grosvenor Place, a patron and prince among
musical professors. Gwendolen had looked forward to this occasion as
one on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was sure to meet Deronda, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been meditating
how to put a question to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) which, without containing a word that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
would feel a dislike to utter, would yet be explicit enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to
understand it. The struggle of opposite feelings would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
abide by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) instinct that the very idea of Deronda's relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was a discouragement to any desperate step towards freedom. The next
wave of emotion was a longing for some word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to enforce a
resolve. The fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) opportunities of conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had
always to be snatched in the doubtful privacy of large parties, caused
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to live through them many times beforehand, imagining how they
would take place and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would say. The irritation was
proportionate when no opportunity came; and this evening at Klesmer's
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) included Deronda in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) anger, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked as calm as
possible at a distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was in danger of betraying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) impatience to every one who spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) only safety
in a chill haughtiness which made Mr. Vandernoodt remark that Mrs.
Grandcourt was becoming a perfect match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) husband. When at last
the chances of the evening brought Deronda near her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), Sir Hugo and Mrs.
Raymond were close by and could hear every word she (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) said. No matter:
her (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) husband was not near, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) irritation passed without check into
a fit of daring which restored the security of her (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) self-possession.
Deronda was there at last, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) would compel him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>)
pleased. Already and without effort rather queenly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) air as she (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>)
stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) white lace and green leaves she (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) threw a royal
permissiveness into her (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) way of saying, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would come and see
me to-morrow between five and six, Mr. Deronda.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There could be but one answer at that moment: <div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a tone
of obedience.

<p/>Afterward it occurred to Deronda that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would write a note to excuse
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had always avoided making a call at Grandcourt's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could
not persuade himself to any step that might hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>), and whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
excuse were taken for indifference or for the affectation of
indifference it would be equally wounding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) promise.
Gwendolen had declined to ride out on the plea of not feeling well
enough having left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) refusal to the last moment when the horses were
soon to be at the door--not without alarm lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband should say
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) too would stay at home. Become almost superstitious about his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
power of suspicious divination, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a glancing forethought of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would do in that case--namely, have herself denied as not well. But
Grandcourt accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) excuse without remark, and rode off.

<p/>Nevertheless when Gwendolen found herself alone, and had sent down the
order that only Mr. Deronda was to be admitted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began to be alarmed
at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had done, and to feel a growing agitation in the thought
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would soon appear, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should soon be obliged to speak: not
of trivialities, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had no serious motive in asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to come:
and yet what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been for hours determining to say began to seem
impossible. For the first time the impulse of appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was being
checked by timidity, and now that it was too late she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was shaken by the
possibility that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might think her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) invitation unbecoming. If so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
would have sunk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) esteem. But immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) resisted this
intolerable fear as an infection from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's way of thinking.
That _he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)_ would say she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was making a fool of herself was rather a
reason why such a judgment would be remote from Deronda's mind. But
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not rid herself from this sudden invasion of womanly
reticence was manifest in a kind of action which had never occurred to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) before. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) struggle between agitation and the effort to
suppress it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was walking up and down the length of the two
drawing-rooms, where at one end a long mirror reflected her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
black dress, chosen in the early morning with a half-admitted reference
to this hour. But above this black dress her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) head on its white pillar
of a neck showed to advantage. Some consciousness of this made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turn
hastily and hurry to the boudoir, where again there was a glass, but
also, tossed over a chair, a large piece of black lace which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
snatched and tied over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) crown of hair so as completely to conceal
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) neck, and leave only her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face looking out from the black frame. In
this manifest contempt of appearance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought it possible to be
freer from nervousness, but the black lace did not take away the
uneasiness from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes and lips.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was standing in the middle of the room when Deronda was announced,
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) too for some reason was
not his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) usual self. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not have defined the change except by
saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked less happy than usual, and appeared to be under
some effort in speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). And yet the speaking was the slightest
possible. They both said, <div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>quite curtly; and Gwendolen,
instead of sitting down, moved to a little distance, resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arms
slightly on the tall back of a chair, while Deronda stood where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
was,--both feeling it difficult to say any more, though the
preoccupation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind could hardly have been more remote than it
was from Gwendolen's conception. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) naturally saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) embarrassment
some reflection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own. Forced to speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) training
in concealment and self-command of no use to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and began with timid
awkwardness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will wonder why I begged you to come. I wanted to ask you
something. You said I was ignorant. That is true. And what can I do but
ask you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And at this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was feeling it utterly impossible to put the
questions she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had intended. Something new in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nervous manner roused
Deronda's anxiety lest there might be a new crisis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said with the
sadness of affection in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My only regret is, that I can be of so little use to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The words
and the tone touched a new spring in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went on with more
sense of freedom, yet still not saying anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had designed to
say, and beginning to hurry, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might somehow arrive at the right
words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to tell you that I have always been thinking of your advice,
but is it any use?--I can't make myself different, because things about
me raise bad feelings--and I must go on--I can alter nothing--it is no
use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) paused an instant, with the consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not finding
the right words, but began again hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``But if I go on I shall get
worse. I want not to get worse. I should like to be what you wish.
There are people who are good and enjoy great things--I know there are.
I am a contemptible creature. I feel as if I should get wicked with
hating people. I have tried to think that I would go away from
everybody. But I can't. There are so many things to hinder me. You
think, perhaps, that I don't mind. But I do mind. I am afraid of
everything. I am afraid of getting wicked. Tell me what I can do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had forgotten everything but that image of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) helpless misery
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was trying to make present to Deronda in broken allusive
speech--wishing to convey but not express all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) need. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes were
tearless, and had a look of smarting in their dilated brilliancy; there
was a subdued sob in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) voice which was more and more veiled, till it
was hardly above a whisper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was hurting herself with the jewels
that glittered on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tightly-clasped fingers pressed against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart.

<p/>The feeling Deronda endured in these moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) afterward called
horrible. Words seemed to have no more rescue in them than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had
been beholding a vessel in peril of wreck--the poor ship with its
many-lived anguish beaten by the inescapable storm. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) grasp
the long-growing process of this young creature's wretchedness?--how
arrest and change it with a sentence? He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own voice.
The words that rushed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind seemed in their feebleness nothing
better than despair made audible, or than that insensibility to
another's hardship which applies precept to soothe pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt
himself holding a crowd of words imprisoned within his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) lips, as if the
letting them escape would be a violation of awe before the mysteries of
our human lot. The thought that urged itself foremost was--<div class="bookquote">``Confess
everything to your husband; have nothing concealed:'' (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>--the words carried
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind a vision of reasons which would have needed much fuller
expressions for Gwendolen to apprehend them, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had begun
those brief sentences, the door opened and the husband entered.

<p/>Grandcourt had deliberately gone out and turned back to satisfy a
suspicion. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) saw was Gwendolen's face of anguish framed black
like a nun's, and Deronda standing three yards from her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) with a look of
sorrow such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might have bent on the last struggle of life in a
beloved object. Without any show of surprise Grandcourt nodded to
Deronda, gave a second look at Gwendolen, passed on, and seated himself
easily at a little distance crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) legs, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
handkerchief and trifling with it elegantly.

<p/>Gwendolen had shrunk and changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) attitude on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
did not turn or move from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) place. It was not a moment in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could feign anything, or manifest any strong revulsion of feeling: the
passionate movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) last speech was still too strong within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).
What she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt beside was a dull despairing sense that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) interview
with Deronda was at an end: a curtain had fallen. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), naturally,
was urged into self-possession and effort by susceptibility to what
might follow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from being seen by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband in this betrayal of
agitation; and feeling that any pretence of ease in prolonging his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
visit would only exaggerate Grandcourt's possible conjectures of
duplicity, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) merely said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not stay longer now. Good bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) press her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) poor little chill
fingers; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said no good-bye.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had left the room, Gwendolen threw herself into a seat, with an
expectation as dull as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) despair--the expectation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was going
to be punished. But Grandcourt took no notice: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was satisfied to have
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), and to keep a silence which
was formidable with omniscience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) went out that evening, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) plea
of feeling ill was accepted without even a sneer.

<p/>The next morning at breakfast he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am going yachting to the
Mediterranean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a leap of heart which had hope in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The day after to-morrow. The yacht is at Marseilles. Lush is gone to
get everything ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I have mamma to stay with me, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, the new
sudden possibility of peace and affection filling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind like a burst
of morning light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you will go with me.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLIX.

<p/>Ever in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) soul
That larger justice which makes gratitude
Triumphed above resentment. ``Tis the mark
Of regal natures, with the wider life.
And fuller capability of joy:--
Not wits exultant in the strongest lens
To show you goodness vanished into pulp
Never worth <div class="bookquote">``thank you'' (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>--they're the devil's friars,
Vowed to be poor as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) in love and trust,
Yet must go begging of a world that keeps
Some human property.


<p/>Deronda, in parting from Gwendolen, had abstained from saying, <div class="bookquote">``I shall
not see you again for a long while: I am going away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)</div>lest Grandcourt
should understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to imply that the fact was of importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was actually going away under circumstances so momentous to himself
that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) set out to fulfill his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) promise of calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
already under the shadow of a solemn emotion which revived the deepest
experience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life.

<p/>Sir Hugo had sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) chambers with the note--<div class="bookquote">``Come
immediately. Something has happened:''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>a preparation that caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
some relief when, on entering the baronet's study, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was received with
grave affection instead of the distress which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had apprehended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing to grieve you, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, in a tone rather of
restored confidence than question, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) took the hand held out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).
There was an unusual meaning in Sir Hugo's look, and a subdued emotion
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Dan, no. Sit down. I have something to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda obeyed, not without presentiment. It was extremely rare for Sir
Hugo to show so much serious feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to grieve me, my boy, no. At least, if there is nothing in it that
will grieve you too much. But I hardly expected that this--just
this--would ever happen. There have been reasons why I have never
prepared you for it. There have been reasons why I have never told you
anything about your parentage. But I have striven in every way not to
make that an injury to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Hugo paused, but Deronda could not speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not say, <div class="bookquote">``I have
never felt it an injury.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Even if that had been true, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not have
trusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) voice to say anything. Far more than any one but himself
could know of was hanging on this moment when the secrecy was to be
broken. Sir Hugo had never seen the grand face he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) delighted in so
pale--the lips pressed together with such a look of pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) went on
with a more anxious tenderness, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had a new fear of wounding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have acted in obedience to your mother's wishes. The secrecy was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
wish. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) desires to remove it. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) desires to see you. I will
put this letter into your hands, which you can look at by-and-by. It
will merely tell you what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wishes you to do, and where you will find
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Hugo held out a letter written on foreign paper, which Deronda
thrust into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) breast-pocket, with a sense of relief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not
called on to read anything immediately. The emotion on Daniel's face
had gained on the baronet, and was visibly shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) composure. Sir
Hugo found it difficult to say more. And Deronda's whole soul was
possessed by a question which was the hardest in the world to utter.
Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) could not bear to delay it. This was a sacramental moment. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
let it pass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) could not recover the influences under which it was
possible to utter the words and meet the answer. For some moments his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
eyes were cast down, and it seemed to both as if thoughts were in the
air between them. But at last Deronda looked at Sir Hugo, and said,
with a tremulous reverence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) voice--dreading to convey indirectly
the reproach that affection had for years been stifling--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is my father also living?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>The answer came immediately in a low emphatic tone--<div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In the mingled emotions which followed that answer it was impossible to
distinguish joy from pain.

<p/>Some new light had fallen on the past for Sir Hugo too in this
interview. After a silence in which Deronda felt like one whose creed
is gone before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) has religiously embraced another, the baronet said,
in a tone of confession--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I was wrong, Dan, to undertake what I did. And perhaps I liked
it a little too well--having you all to myself. But if you have had any
pain which I might have helped, I ask you to forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The forgiveness has long been there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda <div class="bookquote">``The chief pain has
always been on account of some one else--whom I never knew--whom I am
now to know. It has not hindered me from feeling an affection for you
which has made a large part of all the life I remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed one impulse that made the two men clasp each other's hand for
a moment.




<p/>BOOK VII.--THE MOTHER AND THE SON


<p/>CHAPTER L.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If some mortal, born too soon,
Were laid away in some great trance--the ages
Coming and going all the while--till dawned
His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) true time's advent; and could then record
The words they spoke who kept watch by his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) bed,
Then I might tell more of the breath so light
Upon my eyelids, and the fingers warm
Among my hair. Youth is confused; yet never
So dull was I but, when that spirit passed,
I turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), scarce consciously, as turns
A water-snake when fairies cross his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>THE SON CHAPTER L.</b></font>)</div>--BROWNING: _Paracelsus_.


<p/>This was the letter which Sir Hugo put into Deronda's hands:--

<p/>TO MY SON, DANIEL DERONDA.

<p/>My good friend and yours, Sir Hugo Mallinger, will have told you that
I wish to see you. My health is shaken, and I desire there should be
no time lost before I deliver to you what I have long withheld. Let
nothing hinder you from being at the _Albergo dell' Italia_ in
Genoa by the fourteenth of this month. Wait for me there. I am
uncertain when I shall be able to make the journey from Spezia, where
I shall be staying. That will depend on several things. Wait for
me--the Princess Halm-Eberstein. Bring with you the diamond ring that
Sir Hugo gave you. I shall like to see it again.--Your unknown mother,

<p/>LEONORA HALM-EBERSTEIN.

<p/>This letter with its colorless wording gave Deronda no clue to what was
in reserve for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not do otherwise than accept Sir
Hugo's reticence, which seemed to imply some pledge not to anticipate
the mother's disclosures; and the discovery that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) life-long
conjectures had been mistaken checked further surmise. Deronda could
not hinder his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagination from taking a quick flight over what seemed
possibilities, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) refused to contemplate any of them as more likely
than another, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should be nursing it into a dominant desire or
repugnance, instead of simply preparing himself with resolve to meet
the fact bravely, whatever it might turn out to be.

<p/>In this state of mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not have communicated to any one the
reason for the absence which in some quarters he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was obliged to mention
beforehand, least of all to Mordecai, whom it would affect as
powerfully as it did himself, only in rather a different way. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
were to say, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to learn the truth about my birth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mordecai's
hope would gather what might prove a painful, dangerous excitement. To
exclude suppositions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) journey as being undertaken by
Sir Hugo's wish, and threw as much indifference as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) could into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
manner of announcing it, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was uncertain of its duration, but
it would perhaps be very short.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will ask to have the child Jacob to stay with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai,
comforting himself in this way, after the first mournful glances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will drive round and ask Mrs. Cohen to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The grandmother will deny you nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you
were a little wrong as well as I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) added, smiling at Mordecai. <div class="bookquote">``You
thought that old Mrs. Cohen would not bear to see Mirah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I undervalued her (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) is capable of rejoicing
that another's plant blooms though her (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) own be withered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they are dear good people; I feel as if we all belonged to each
other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, with a tinge of merriment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What should you have felt if that Ezra had been your brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, mischievously--a little provoked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had taken kindly at
once to people who had caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) so much prospective annoyance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
account.

<p/>Mirah looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with a slight surprise for a moment, and then said,
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) is not a bad man--I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) would never forsake any one.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) uttered the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) blushed deeply, and glancing timidly at
Mordecai, turned away to some occupation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) father was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind,
and this was a subject on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) brother had a painful
mutual consciousness. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) should come and find us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>was a thought
which to Mirah sometimes made the street daylight as shadowy as a
haunted forest where each turn screened for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) an imaginary apparition.

<p/>Deronda felt what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) involuntary allusion, and understood the
blush. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) be slow to understand feelings which now seemed
nearer than ever to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own? for the words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother's letter
implied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) filial relation was not to be freed from painful
conditions; indeed, singularly enough that letter which had brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
mother nearer as a living reality had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) into more remoteness
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) affections. The tender yearning after a being whose life might
have been the worse for not having his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) care and love, the image of a
mother who had not had all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dues, whether of reverence or
compassion, had long been secretly present with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) observation
of all the women he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had come near. But it seemed now that this
picturing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother might fit the facts no better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) former
conceptions about Sir Hugo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wondered to find that when this mother's
very hand-writing had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with words holding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) actual
feeling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) affections had suddenly shrunk into a state of comparative
neutrality toward her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). A veiled figure with enigmatic speech had thrust
away that image which, in spite of uncertainty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) clinging thought
had gradually modeled and made the possessor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tenderness and
duteous longing. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) set off to Genoa, the interest really
uppermost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind had hardly so much relation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother as to
Mordecai and Mirah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Dan!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>Sir Hugo had said, when they shook hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Whatever else changes for you, it can't change my being the oldest
friend you have known, and the one who has all along felt the most for
you. I couldn't have loved you better if you'd been my own-only I
should have been better pleased with thinking of you always as the
future master of the Abbey instead of my fine nephew; and then you
would have seen it necessary for you to take a political line.
However--things must be as they may.''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>It was a defensive movement of
the baronet's to mingle purposeless remarks with the expression of
serious feeling.

<p/>When Deronda arrived at the _Italia_ in Genoa, no Princess
Halm-Eberstein was there; but on the second day there was a letter for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), saying that her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) arrival might happen within a week, or might be
deferred a fortnight and more; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was under circumstances which made
it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) to fix her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) journey more precisely, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to wait as patiently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could.

<p/>With this indefinite prospect of suspense on matters of supreme moment
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), Deronda set about the difficult task of seeking amusement on
philosophic grounds, as a means of quieting excited feeling and giving
patience a lift over a weary road. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) former visit to the superb city
had been only cursory, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) much to learn beyond the prescribed
round of sight-seeing, by spending the cooler hours in observant
wandering about the streets, the quay, and the environs; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) often
took a boat that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might enjoy the magnificent view of the city and
harbor from the sea. All sights, all subjects, even the expected
meeting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother, found a central union in Mordecai and Mirah,
and the ideas immediately associated with them; and among the thoughts
that most filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind while his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) boat was pushing about within view
of the grand harbor was that of the multitudinous Spanish Jews
centuries ago driven destitute from their Spanish homes, suffered to
land from the crowded ships only for a brief rest on this grand quay of
Genoa, overspreading it with a pall of famine and plague--dying mothers
and dying children at their breasts--fathers and sons a-gaze at each
other's haggardness, like groups from a hundred Hunger-towers turned
out beneath the midday sun. Inevitably dreamy constructions of a
possible ancestry for himself would weave themselves with historic
memories which had begun to have a new interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>)
discovery of Mirah, and now, under the influence of Mordecai, had
become irresistibly dominant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) would have sealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind against
such constructions if it had been possible, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had never yet fully
admitted to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) wished the facts to verify Mordecai's
conviction: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) inwardly repeated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had no choice in the matter,
and that wishing was folly--nay, on the question of parentage, wishing
seemed part of that meanness which disowns kinship: it was a disowning
by anticipation. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had to do was simply to accept the fact; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had really no strong presumption to go upon, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was assured
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mistake about Sir Hugo. There had been a resolved concealment
which made all inference untrustworthy, and the very name he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) bore might
be a false one. If Mordecai was wrong--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), the so-called Daniel
Deronda, were held by ties entirely aloof from any such course as his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
friend's pathetic hope had marked out?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would not say <div class="bookquote">``I wish'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not help feeling on which side the sacrifice lay.

<p/>Across these two importunate thoughts, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) resisted as much as one
can resist anything in that unstrung condition which belongs to
suspense, there came continually an anxiety which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) made no effort to
banish--dwelling on it rather with a mournfulness, which often seems to
us the best atonement we can make to one whose need we have been unable
to meet. The anxiety was for Gwendolen. In the wonderful mixtures of
our nature there is a feeling distinct from that exclusive passionate
love of which some men and women -LRB-by no means all-RRB- are capable, which
yet is not the same with friendship, nor with a merely benevolent
regard, whether admiring or compassionate: a man, say--for it is a man
who is here concerned--hardly represents to himself this shade of
feeling toward a woman more nearly than in words, <div class="bookquote">``I should have loved
her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>), if--'' (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>: the <div class="bookquote">``if''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>covering some prior growth in the inclinations,
or else some circumstances which have made an inward prohibitory law as
a stay against the emotions ready to quiver out of balance. The <div class="bookquote">``if''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>in
Deronda's case carried reasons of both kinds; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had never
throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) relations with Gwendolen been free from the nervous
consciousness that there was something to guard against not only on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
account but on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own--some precipitancy in the manifestations of
impulsive feeling--some ruinous inroad of what is but momentary on the
permanent chosen treasure of the heart--some spoiling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) trust,
which wrought upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) now as if it had been the retreating cry of a
creature snatched and carried out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) reach by swift horsemen or
swifter waves, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own strength was only a stronger sense of
weakness. How could his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) feelings for Gwendolen ever be exactly like his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
feelings for other women, even when there was one by whose side he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
desired to stand apart from them? Strangely the figure entered into the
pictures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) present and future; strangely -LRB-and now it seemed sadly-RRB-
their two lots had come in contact, hers narrowly personal, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) charged
with far-reaching sensibilities, perhaps with durable purposes, which
were hardly more present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) than the reasons why men migrate are
present to the birds that come as usual for the crumbs and find them no
more. Not that Deronda was too ready to imagine himself of supreme
importance to a woman; but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words of insistance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) must <div class="bookquote">``remain
near her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)--must not forsake her (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--continually recurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with the
clearness and importunity of imagined sounds, such as Dante has said
pierce us like arrows whose points carry the sharpness of pity--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lamenti saettaron me diversi
Cà che di piefermti avean gli strali?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dante/DANTE</b></font>)</div><p/>Day after day passed, and the very air of Italy seemed to carry the
consciousness that war had been declared against Austria, and every day
was a hurrying march of crowded Time toward the world-changing battle
of Sadowa. Meanwhile, in Genoa, the noons were getting hotter, the
converging outer roads getting deeper with white dust, the oleanders in
the tubs along the wayside gardens looking more and more like fatigued
holiday-makers, and the sweet evening changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) office--scattering
abroad those whom the midday had sent under shelter, and sowing all
paths with happy social sounds, little tinklings of mule-bells and
whirrings of thrumbed strings, light footsteps and voices, if not
leisurely, then with the hurry of pleasure in them; while the
encircling heights, crowned with forts, skirted with fine dwellings and
gardens, seemed also to come forth and gaze in fullness of beauty after
their long siesta, till all strong color melted in the stream of
moonlight which made the Streets a new spectacle with shadows, both
still and moving, on cathedral steps and against the façades of massive
palaces; and then slowly with the descending moon all sank in deep
night and silence, and nothing shone but the port lights of the great
Lanterna in the blackness below, and the glimmering stars in the
blackness above. Deronda, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) suspense, watched this revolving of
the days as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might have watched a wonderful clock where the striking
of the hours was made solemn with antique figures advancing and
retreating in monitory procession, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) still kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ear open for
another kind of signal which would have its solemnity too: He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
beginning to sicken of occupation, and found himself contemplating all
activity with the aloofness of a prisoner awaiting ransom. In his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
letters to Mordecai and Hans, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had avoided writing about himself, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was really getting into that state of mind to which all subjects
become personal; and the few books he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had brought to make him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) a refuge
in study were becoming unreadable, because the point of view that life
would make for him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was in that agitating moment of uncertainty which is
close upon decision.

<p/>Many nights were watched through by him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) in gazing from the open window
of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) room on the double, faintly pierced darkness of the sea and the
heavens; often in struggling under the oppressive skepticism which
represented his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) particular lot, with all the importance he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was allowing
Mordecai to give it, as of no more lasting effect than a dream--a set
of changes which made passion to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), but beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) consciousness were
no more than an imperceptible difference of mass and shadow; sometimes
with a reaction of emotive force which gave even to sustained
disappointment, even to the fulfilled demand of sacrifice, the nature
of a satisfied energy, and spread over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) young future, whatever it
might be, the attraction of devoted service; sometimes with a sweet
irresistible hopefulness that the very best of human possibilities
might befall him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)--the blending of a complete personal love in one
current with a larger duty; and sometimes again in a mood of rebellion
-LRB-what human creature escapes it?-RRB- against things in general because
they are thus and not otherwise, a mood in which Gwendolen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
equivocal fate moved as busy images of what was amiss in the world
along with the concealments which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had felt as a hardship in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own
life, and which were acting in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) now under the form of an afflicting
doubtfulness about the mother who had announced herself coldly and
still kept away.

<p/>But at last she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was come. One morning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) third week of waiting
there was a new kind of knock at the door. A servant in Chasseurs
livery entered and delivered in French the verbal message that, the
Princess Halm-Eberstein had arrived, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was going to rest during
the day, but would be obliged if Monsieur would dine early, so as to be
at liberty at seven, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would be able to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER LI.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) held the spindle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) sat,
Errina with the thick-coiled mat
Of raven hair and deepest agate eyes,
Gazing with a sad surprise
At surging visions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) destiny--
To spin the byssus drearily
In insect-labor, while the throng
Of gods and men wrought deeds that poets wrought in song.


<p/>When Deronda presented himself at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother's apartment in
the _Italia_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt some revival of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) boyhood with its premature
agitations. The two servants in the antechamber looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) markedly,
a little surprised that the doctor their lady had come to consult was
this striking young gentleman whose appearance gave even the severe
lines of an evening dress the credit of adornment. But Deronda could
notice nothing until, the second door being opened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) found himself in
the presence of a figure which at the other end of the large room stood
awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) approach.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was covered, except as to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face and part of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms, with black
lace hanging loosely from the summit of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whitening hair to the long
train stretching from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tall figure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms, naked to the elbow,
except for some rich bracelets, were folded before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and the fine
poise of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head made it look handsomer than it really was. But
Deronda felt no interval of observation before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was close in front of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), holding the hand she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had put out and then raising it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) lips.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) still kept her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) examiningly; while his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
chief consciousness was that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes were piercing and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face so
mobile that the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might look like a different person. For
even while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was examining him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) there was a play of the brow and
nostril which made a tacit language. Deronda dared no movement, not
able to conceive what sort of manifestation her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feeling demanded; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt himself changing color like a girl, and yet wondering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
own lack of emotion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had lived through so many ideal meetings with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother, and they had seemed more real than this! He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not even
conjecture in what language she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagined it
would not be English. Suddenly, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) let fall his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand, and placed both
hers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shoulders, while her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face gave out a flash of admiration in
which every worn line disappeared and seemed to leave a restored youth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a beautiful creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, in a low melodious voice,
with syllables which had what might be called a foreign but agreeable
outline. <div class="bookquote">``I knew you would be.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) on each cheek, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) returned the kisses. But it was something like a greeting between
royalties.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) paused a moment while the lines were coming back into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face, and
then said in a colder tone, <div class="bookquote">``I am your mother. But you can have no love
for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought of you more than of any other being in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) voice trembling nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not like what you thought I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother decisively,
withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shoulders, and folding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms as
before, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to observe her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had
often pictured her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) imagination as one which had a likeness
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw some of the likeness now, but amidst more striking
differences. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a remarkable looking being. What was it that gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son a painful sense of aloofness?--Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) worn beauty had a
strangeness in it as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were not quite a human mother, but a
Melusina, who had ties with some world which is independent of ours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to think that you might be suffering,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, anxious
above all not to wound her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I used to wish that I could be a comfort
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _am_ suffering. But with a suffering that you can't comfort,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said
the Princess, in a harder voice than before, moving to a sofa where
cushions had been carefully arranged for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Sit down.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) pointed
to a seat near her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>); and then discerning some distress in Deronda's
face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) added, more gently, <div class="bookquote">``I am not suffering at this moment. I am
at ease now. I am able to talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda seated himself and waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) to speak again. It seemed as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) were in the presence of a mysterious Fate rather than of the
longed-for mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was beginning to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with wonder, from the
spiritual distance to which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began: <div class="bookquote">``I did not send for you to comfort me. I could not
know beforehand--I don't know now--what you will feel toward me. I have
not the foolish notion that you can love me merely because I am your
mother, when you have never seen or heard of me in all your life. But I
thought I chose something better for you than being with me. I did not
think I deprived you of anything worth having.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot wish me to believe that your affection would not have been
worth having,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) paused as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) expected
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to make some answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to speak ill of myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess, with proud
impetuosity, <div class="bookquote">``But I had not much affection to give you. I did not want
affection. I had been stifled with it. I wanted to live out the life
that was in me, and not to be hampered with other lives. You wonder
what I was. I was no princess then.''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) rose with a sudden movement,
and stood as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had done before. Deronda immediately rose too; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt
breathless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No princess in this tame life that I live in now. I was a great
singer, and I acted as well as I sang. All the rest were poor beside
me. Men followed me from one country to another. I was living a myriad
lives in one. I did not want a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a passionate self-defence in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had cast all
precedent out of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) mind. Precedent had no excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
could only seek a justification in the intensest words she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) could find
for her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) experience. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) seemed to fling out the last words against some
possible reproach in the mind of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) son, who had to stand and hear
them--clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) coat-collar as if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) were keeping himself above
water by it, and feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) blood in the sort of commotion that might
have been excited if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) going through some strange rite of
a religion which gave a sacredness to crime. What else had she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) went on with the same intensity and a sort of pale
illumination in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not want to marry. I was forced into marrying your
father--forced, I mean, by my father's wishes and commands; and
besides, it was my best way of getting some freedom. I could rule my
husband, but not my father. I had a right to be free. I had a right to
seek my freedom from a bondage that I hated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) seated herself again, while there was that subtle movement in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
eyes and closed lips which is like the suppressed continuation of
speech. Deronda continued standing, and after a moment or two she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with a less defiant pleading as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the bondage I hated for myself I wanted to keep you from. What
better could the most loving mother have done? I relieved you from the
bondage of having been born a Jew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I _am_ a Jew?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda burst out with a deep-voiced energy that
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother shrink a little backward against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cushions. <div class="bookquote">``My
father was a Jew, and you are a Jewess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, your father was my cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with a
change in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) look, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw something that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might have to be
afraid of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, impetuously, in the veiled voice of
passion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not have imagined beforehand how he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would have come
to say that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had never hitherto admitted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not have
dreamed that it would be in impulsive opposition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
shaken by a mixed anger which no reflection could come soon enough to
check, against this mother who it seemed had borne him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) unwillingly, had
willingly made herself a stranger to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), and--perhaps--was now making
herself known unwillingly. This last suspicion seemed to flash some
explanation over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) speech.

<p/>But the mother was equally shaken by an anger differently mixed, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) frame was less equal to any repression. The shaking with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
visibly physical, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes looked the larger for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pallid
excitement as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said violently--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you say you are glad? You are an English gentleman. I secured
you that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not know what you secured me. How could you choose my
birthright for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, throwing himself sideways into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
chair again, almost unconsciously, and leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) arm over the back,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was fired with an intolerance that seemed foreign to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
now trying hard to master himself and keep silence. A horror had swept
in upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) anger lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should say something too hard in this moment
which made an epoch never to be recalled. There was a pause before his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
mother spoke again, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice had become more firmly
resistant in its finely varied tones:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I chose for you what I would have chosen for myself. How could I know
that you would have the spirit of my father in you? How could I know
that you would love what I hated?--if you really love to be a Jew.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The
last words had such bitterness in them that any one overhearing might
have supposed some hatred had arisen between the mother and son.

<p/>But Deronda had recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) fuller self. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was recalling his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
sensibilities to what life had been and actually was for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whose best
years were gone, and who with the signs of suffering in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) frame was
now exerting herself to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) of a past which was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) alone but
also hers. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) habitual shame at the acceptance of events as if they
were his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) only, helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) even here. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother
silently after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last words, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face regained some of its
penetrative calm; yet it seemed to have a strangely agitating influence
over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>): her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with a sort of fascination, but
not with any repose of maternal delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, if I speak hastily,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, with diffident gravity. <div class="bookquote">``Why
have you resolved now on disclosing to me what you took care to have me
brought up in ignorance of? Why--since you seem angry that I should be
glad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--the reasons of our actions!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess, with a ring of
something like sarcastic scorn. ``When you are as old as I am, it will
not seem so simple a question--``Why did you do this?<div class="bookquote">'' People talk of
their motives in a cut and dried way. Every woman is supposed to have
the same set of motives, or else to be a monster. I am not a monster,
but I have not felt exactly what other women feel--or say they feel,
for fear of being thought unlike others. When you reproach me in your
heart for sending you away from me, you mean that I ought to say I felt
about you as other women say they feel about their children. I did
_not_ feel that. I was glad to be freed from you. But I did well for
you, and I gave you your father's fortune. Do I seem now to be revoking
everything?--Well, there are reasons. I feel many things that I cannot
understand. A fatal illness has been growing in me for a year. I shall
very likely not live another year. I will not deny anything I have
done. I will not pretend to love where I have no love. But shadows are
rising round me. Sickness makes them. If I have wronged the dead--I
have but little time to do what I left undone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the actress</b></font>)</div><p/>The varied transitions of tone with which this speech was delivered
were as perfect as the most accomplished actress could have made them.
The speech was in fact a piece of what may be called sincere acting;
this woman's nature was one in which all feeling--and all the more when
it was tragic as well as real--immediately became matter of conscious
representation: experience immediately passed into drama, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) acted
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own emotions. In a minor degree this is nothing uncommon, but in
the Princess the acting had a rare perfection of physiognomy, voice,
and gesture. It would not be true to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) felt less because of
this double consciousness: she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) felt--that is, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) mind went
through--all the more, but with a difference; each nucleus of pain or
pleasure had a deep atmosphere of the excitement or spiritual
intoxication which at once exalts and deadens. But Deronda made no
reflection of this kind. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thoughts hung on the purport of what
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother was saying; her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tones and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wonderful face entered into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) agitation without being noted. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) longed for with an awed
desire was to know as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) of the strange mental
conflict under which it seemed he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been brought into the world; what
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) compassionate nature made the controlling idea within him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) were the
suffering and the confession that breathed through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) later words, and
these forbade any further question, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) paused and remained
silent, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brow knit, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head turned a little away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) large eyes fixed as if on something incorporeal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) must wait for
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to speak again. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did so with strange abruptness, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) suddenly, and saying more quickly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Hugo has written much about you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) tells me you have a wonderful
mind--you comprehend everything--you are wiser than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) is with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
sixty years. You say you are glad to know that you were born a Jew. I
am not going to tell you that I have changed my mind about that. Your
feelings are against mine. You don't thank me for what I did. Shall you
comprehend your mother, or only blame her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is not a fibre within me but makes me wish to comprehend her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sharp gaze solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``It is a bitter reversal
of my longing to think of blaming her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). What I have been most trying to
do for fifteen years is to have some understanding of those who differ
from myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you have become unlike your grandfather in that.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother copy</b></font>)</div>said the
mother, <div class="bookquote">``though you are a young copy of him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) in your face. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) never
comprehended me, or if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) did, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) only thought of fettering me into
obedience. I was to be what he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) called `the Jewish woman' under pain of
his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) curse. I was to feel everything I did not feel, and believe
everything I did not believe. I was to feel awe for the bit of
parchment in the _mezuza_ over the door; to dread lest a bit of butter
should touch a bit of meat; to think it beautiful that men should bind
the _tephillin_ on them, and women not,--to adore the wisdom of such
laws, however silly they might seem to me. I was to love the long
prayers in the ugly synagogue, and the howling, and the gabbling, and
the dreadful fasts, and the tiresome feasts, and my father's endless
discoursing about our people, which was a thunder without meaning in my
ears. I was to care forever about what Israel had been; and I did not
care at all. I cared for the wide world, and all that I could represent
in it. I hated living under the shadow of my father's strictness.
Teaching, teaching for everlasting--`this you must be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother copy</b></font>)</div>`that you must
not be'--pressed on me like a frame that got tighter and tighter as I
grew. I wanted to live a large life, with freedom to do what every one
else did, and be carried along in a great current, not obliged to care.
Ah!''--here her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tone changed to one of a more bitter incisiveness--<div class="bookquote">``you
are glad to have been born a Jew. You say so. That is because you have
not been brought up as a Jew. That separateness seems sweet to you
because I saved you from it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you resolved on that, you meant that I should never know my
origin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, impulsively. <div class="bookquote">``You have at least changed in your
feeling on that point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that was what I meant. That is what I persevered in. And it is
not true to say that I have changed. Things have changed in spite of
me. I am still the same Leonora'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pointed with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forefinger to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast--<div class="bookquote">``here within me is the same desire, the same will, the same
choice, _but_'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spread out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands, palm upward, on each side of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) paused with a bitter compression of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lip, then let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
voice fall into muffled, rapid utterance--<div class="bookquote">``events come upon us like
evil enchantments: and thoughts, feelings, apparitions in the darkness
are events--are they not? I don't consent. We only consent to what we
love. I obey something tyrannic'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spread out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands again--<div class="bookquote">``I am

mean--to take the course you did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, trying by this

piteousness of this mingled suffering and defiance. <div class="bookquote">``I gather that my

air of decision. <div class="bookquote">``You are not a woman. You may try--but you can never
imagine what it is to have a man's force of genius in you, and yet to
suffer the slavery of being a girl. To have a pattern cut out--`this is

for; a woman's heart must be of such a size and no larger, else it must
be pressed small, like Chinese feet; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) happiness is to be made as
cakes are, by a fixed receipt.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>That was what my father wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wished I had been a son; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cared for me as a make-shift link. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
heart was set on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Judaism. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hated that Jewish women should be
thought of by the Christian world as a sort of ware to make public
singers and actresses of. As if we were not the more enviable for that!
That is a chance of escaping from bondage.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was my grandfather a learned man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, eager to know
particulars that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) feared his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother might not think of.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered impatiently, putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,--and a clever
physician--and good: I don't deny that he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) was good. A man to be admired
in a play--grand, with an iron will. Like the old Foscari before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pardons. But such men turn their wives and daughters into slaves. They
would rule the world if they could; but not ruling the world, they
throw all the weight of their will on the necks and souls of women. But
nature sometimes thwarts them. My father had no other child than his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
daughter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was like himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had folded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms again, and looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were ready to face
some impending attempt at mastery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father was different. Unlike me--all lovingness and affection. I
knew I could rule him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and I made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) secretly promise me, before I
married him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would put no hindrance in the way of my being an
artist. My father was on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) deathbed when we were married: from the
first he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind on my marrying my cousin Ephraim. And when
a woman's will is as strong as the man's who wants to govern her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), half
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strength must be concealment. I meant to have my will in the end,
but I could only have it by seeming to obey. I had an awe of my
father--always I had had an awe of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>): it was impossible to help it. I
hated to feel awed--I wished I could have defied him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) openly; but I
never could. It was what I could not imagine: I could not act it to
myself that I should begin to defy my father openly and succeed. And I
never would risk failure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This last sentence was uttered with an abrupt emphasis, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) paused
after it as if the words had raised a crowd of remembrances which
obstructed speech. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son was listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with feelings more and
more highly mixed; the first sense of being repelled by the frank
coldness which had replaced all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) preconceptions of a mother's tender
joy in the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); the first impulses of indignation at what
shocked his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) most cherished emotions and principles--all these busy
elements of collision between them were subsiding for a time, and
making more and more room for that effort at just allowance and that
admiration of a forcible nature whose errors lay along high pathways,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would have felt if, instead of being his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been
a stranger who had appealed to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sympathy. Still it was impossible to
be dispassionate: he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) trembled lest the next thing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had to say would
be more repugnant to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) than what had gone before: he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was afraid of
the strange coërcion she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed to be under to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind bare: he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
almost wished he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could say, <div class="bookquote">``Tell me only what is necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then
again he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) felt the fascination which made him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) watch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and listen to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eagerly. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) tried to recall her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to particulars by asking--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where was my grandfather's home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here in Genoa, where I was married; and his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) family had lived here
generations ago. But my father had been in various countries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must surely have lived in England?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother was English--a Jewess of Portuguese descent. My father
married her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in England. Certain circumstances of that marriage made all
the difference in my life: through that marriage my father thwarted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
own plans. My mother's sister was a singer, and afterward she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) married
the English partner of a merchant's house here in Genoa, and they came
and lived here eleven years. My mother died when I was eight years old,
and my father allowed me to be continually with my Aunt Leonora and be
taught under her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) eyes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not minded the danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>)
encouraging my wish to be a singer, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) had been. But this was it--I
saw it again and again in my father:--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not guard against
consequences, because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could hinder them if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) liked.
Before my aunt left Genoa, I had had enough teaching to bring out the
born singer and actress within me: my father did not know everything
that was done; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew that I was taught music and singing--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew
my inclination. That was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meant that I should obey
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will. And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was resolved that I should marry my cousin Ephraim,
the only one left of my father's family that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew. I wanted not to
marry. I thought of all plans to resist it, but at last I found that I
could rule my cousin, and I consented. My father died three weeks after
we were married, and then I had my way!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uttered these words almost
exultantly; but after a little pause her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face changed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said in
a biting tone, <div class="bookquote">``It has not lasted, though. My father is getting his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began to look more contemplatively again at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, and presently
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--but milder--there is something of your own father in
you; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made it the labor of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life to devote himself to me:
wound up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) money-changing and banking, and lived to wait upon me--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
went against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) conscience for me. As I loved the life of my art, so
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loved me. Let me look at your hand again: the hand with the ring on.
It was your father's ring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) chair nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hand. We know what
kind of a hand it was: her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own, very much smaller, was of the same
type. As he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) felt the smaller hand holding his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) saw nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
the face that held the likeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own, aged not by time but by
intensity, the strong bent of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) nature toward a reverential
tenderness asserted itself above every other impression and in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) most
fervent tone he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother! take us all into your heart--the living and the dead. Forgive
every thing that hurts you in the past. Take my affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) admiringly rather than lovingly, then kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) on
the brow, and saying sadly, <div class="bookquote">``I reject nothing, but I have nothing to
give,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) released his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hand and sank back on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cushions. Deronda
turned pale with what seems always more of a sensation than an
emotion--the pain of repulsed tenderness. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) noticed the expression of
pain, and said, still with melodious melancholy in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tones--

<p/>``It is better so. We must part again soon and you owe me no duties. I
did not wish you to be born. I parted with you willingly. When your
father died I resolved that I would have no more ties, but such as I
could free myself from. I was the Alcharisi you have heard of: the name
had magic wherever it was carried. Men courted me. Sir Hugo Mallinger
was one who wished to marry me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) was madly in love with me. One day I
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>), ``Is there a man capable of doing something for love of me,
and expecting nothing in return?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said: ``What is it you want done?''
I said, ``Take my boy and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up as an Englishman, and never let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) know anything about his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) parents.<div class="bookquote">'' You were little more than two
years old, and were sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) foot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would pay
money to have such a boy. I had not meditated much on the plan
beforehand, but as soon as I had spoken about it, it took possession of
me as something I could not rest without doing. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought I
was not serious, but I convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was never surprised at
anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) agreed that it would be for your good, and the finest
thing for you. A great singer and actress is a queen, but she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) gives no
royalty to her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) son. All that happened at Naples. And afterward I made
Sir Hugo the trustee of your fortune. That is what I did; and I had a
joy in doing it. My father had tyrannized over me--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cared more about
a grandson to come than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did about me: I counted as nothing. You were
to be such a Jew as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>); you were to be what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) wanted. But you were my
son, and it was my turn to say what you should be. I said you should
not know you were a Jew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>parents</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for months events have been preparing me to be glad that I am a
Jew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) opposition roused again. The point touched the
quick of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) experience. <div class="bookquote">``It would always have been better that I
should have known the truth. I have always been rebelling against the
secrecy that looked like shame. It is no shame to have Jewish
parents--the shame is to disown it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say it was a shame to me, then, that I used that secrecy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother, with a flash of new anger. <div class="bookquote">``There is no shame attaching to
me. I have no reason to be ashamed. I rid myself of the Jewish tatters
and gibberish that make people nudge each other at sight of us, as if
we were tattooed under our clothes, though our faces are as whole as
theirs. I delivered you from the pelting contempt that pursues Jewish
separateness. I am not ashamed that I did it. It was the better for
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why have you now undone the secrecy?--no, not undone it--the
effects will never be undone. But why have you now sent for me to tell
me that I am a Jew?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with an intensity of opposition in
feeling that was almost bitter. It seemed as if her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) words had called
out a latent obstinacy of race in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?--ah, why?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess, rising quickly and walking to the
other side of the room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) turned round and slowly approached
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), too, stood up. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) began to speak again in a more
veiled voice. <div class="bookquote">``I can't explain; I can only say what is. I don't love my
father's religion now any more than I did then. Before I married the
second time I was baptized; I made myself like the people I lived
among. I had a right to do it; I was not like a brute, obliged to go
with my own herd. I have not repented; I will not say that I have
repented. But yet'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--here she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had come near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) son, and paused; then
again retreated a little and stood still, as if resolute not to give
way utterly to an imperious influence; but, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) went on speaking,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) became more and more unconscious of anything but the awe that
subdued her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``It is illness, I don't doubt that it has been
gathering illness--my mind has gone back: more than a year ago it
began. You see my gray hair, my worn look: it has all come fast.
Sometimes I am in an agony of pain--I dare say I shall be to-night.
Then it is as if all the life I have chosen to live, all thoughts, all
will, forsook me and left me alone in spots of memory, and I can't get
away: my pain seems to keep me there. My childhood--my girlhood--the
day of my marriage--the day of my father's death--there seems to be
nothing since. Then a great horror comes over me: what do I know of
life or death? and what my father called `right' may be a power that is
laying hold of me--that is clutching me now. Well, I will satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
I cannot go into the darkness without satisfying him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I have hidden
what was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I thought once I would burn it. I have not burned it. I
thank God I have not burned it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) threw herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) cushions again, visibly fatigued. Deronda,
moved too strongly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) suffering for other impulses to act within
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), drew near her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and said, entreatingly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you not spare yourself this evening? Let us leave the rest till
to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said decisively. ``I will confess it all, now that I have come
up to it. Often when I am at ease it all fades away; my whole self
comes quite back; but I know it will sink away again, and the other
will come--the poor, solitary, forsaken remains of self, that can
resist nothing. It was my nature to resist, and say, ``I have a right to
resist.<div class="bookquote">'' Well, I say so still when I have any strength in me. You have
heard me say it, and I don't withdraw it. But when my strength goes,

and even when I am at ease, it is beginning to make ghosts upon the
daylight. And now you have made it worse for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said, with a
sudden return of impetuosity; <div class="bookquote">``but I shall have told you everything.
And what reproach is there against me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) added bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``since I
have made you glad to be a Jew? Joseph Kalonymos reproached me: he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) said
you had been turned into a proud Englishman, who resented being touched
by a Jew. I wish you had!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) ended, with a new marvelous alternation.
It was as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) mind were breaking into several, one jarring the other
into impulsive action.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is Joseph Kalonymos?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with a darting recollection of
that Jew who touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) arm in the Frankfort synagogue.

<p/>``Ah! some vengeance sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) back from the East, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) might see you
and come to reproach me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) was my father's friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) knew of your
birth: he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) knew of my husband's death, and once, twenty years ago, after
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) had been away in the Levant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) came to see me and inquire about
you. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) that you were dead: I meant you to be dead to all the
world of my childhood. If I had said that your were living, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) would
have interfered with my plans: he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) would have taken on him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) to represent
my father, and have tried to make me recall what I had done. What could
I do but say you were dead? The act was done. If I had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) of it
there would have been trouble and scandal--and all to conquer me, who
would not have been conquered. I was strong then, and I would have had
my will, though there might have been a hard fight against me. I took
the way to have it without any fight. I felt then that I was not really
deceiving: it would have come to the same in the end; or if not to the
same, to something worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) believed me and begged that I would give
up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) the chest that my father had charged me and my husband to
deliver to our eldest son. I knew what was in the chest--things that
had been dinned in my ears since I had had any understanding--things
that were thrust on my mind that I might feel them like a wall around
my life--my life that was growing like a tree. Once, after my husband
died, I was going to burn the chest. But it was difficult to burn; and
burning a chest and papers looks like a shameful act. I have committed
no shameful act--except what Jews would call shameful. I had kept the
chest, and I gave it to Joseph Kalonymos. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) went away mournful, and
said, ``If you marry again, and if another grandson is born to him (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) who
is departed, I will deliver up the chest to him (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">'' I bowed in silence. I
meant not to marry again--no more than I meant to be the shattered
woman that I am now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ceased speaking, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head sank back while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked vaguely
before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought was traveling through the years, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
began to speak again her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice had lost its argumentative spirit, and
had fallen into a veiled tone of distress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But months ago this Kalonymos saw you in the synagogue at Frankfort.
He (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) saw you enter the hotel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) went to ask your name. There was

about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is not my real name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with a dislike even to

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, as real as another,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother, indifferently. ``The Jews
have always been changing their names. My father's family had kept the
name of Charisi: my husband was a Charisi. When I came out as a singer,
we made it Alcharisi. But there had been a branch of the family my
father had lost sight of who called themselves Deronda, and when I
wanted a name for you, and Sir Hugo said, ``Let it be a foreign name,<div class="bookquote">'' I
thought of Deronda. But Joseph Kalonymos had heard my father speak of
the Deronda branch, and the name confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) suspicion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) began to
suspect what had been done. It was as if everything had been whispered
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) in the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) found out where I was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) took a journey into
Russia to see me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) found me weak and shattered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) had come back
again, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) white hair, and with rage in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) soul against me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>)
said I was going down to the grave clad in falsehood and
robbery--falsehood to my father and robbery of my own child. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) accused
me of having kept the knowledge of your birth from you, and having
brought you up as if you had been the son of an English gentleman.
Well, it was true; and twenty years before I would have maintained that
I had a right to do it. But I can maintain nothing now. No faith is
strong within me. My father may have God on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side. This man's words
were like lion's teeth upon me. My father's threats eat into me with my
pain. If I tell everything--if I deliver up everything--what else can
be demanded of me? I cannot make myself love the people I have never
loved--is it not enough that I lost the life I did love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had leaned forward a little in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) low-toned pleading, that seemed
like a smothered cry: her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) arms and hands were stretched out at full
length, as if strained in beseeching, Deronda's soul was absorbed in
the anguish of compassion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not mind now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been
repulsed before. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) pity made a flood of forgiveness within him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
single impulse was to kneel by her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) and take her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hand gently, between
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) palms, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said in that exquisite voice of soothing which
expresses oneness with the sufferer--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, take comfort!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sufferer</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) did not seem inclined to repulse him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) now, but looked down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) take both her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hands to fold between his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). Gradually tears
gathered, but she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) handkerchief against her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) eyes and then
leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) brow, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) wished that they should
not look at each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not possible that I could be near you often and comfort you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was under that stress of pity that propels us on
sacrifices.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) answered, lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) head again and
withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hand as if she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to move away. <div class="bookquote">``I have a
husband and five children. None of them know of your existence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda felt painfully silenced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rose and stood at a little distance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wonder why I married,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) went on presently, under the influence
of a newly-recurring thought. <div class="bookquote">``I meant never to marry again. I meant to
be free and to live for my art. I had parted with you. I had no bonds.
For nine years I was a queen. I enjoyed the life I had longed for. But
something befell me. It was like a fit of forgetfulness. I began to
sing out of tune. They told me of it. Another woman was thrusting
herself in my place. I could not endure the prospect of failure and
decline. It was horrible to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) started up again, with a shudder,
and lifted screening hands like one who dreads missiles. ``It drove me
to marry. I made believe that I preferred being the wife of a Russian
noble to being the greatest lyric actress of Europe; I made believe--I
acted that part. It was because I felt my greatness sinking away from
me, as I feel my life sinking now. I would not wait till men said, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>)
had better go.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sank into her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) seat again, and looked at the evening sky as she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) went
on: <div class="bookquote">``I repented. It was a resolve taken in desperation. That singing
out of tune was only like a fit of illness; it went away. I repented;
but it was too late. I could not go back. All things hindered, me--all
things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A new haggardness had come in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) face, but her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) son refrained from
again urging her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to leave further speech till the morrow: there was
evidently some mental relief for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in an outpouring such as she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could
never have allowed herself before. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) stood still while she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) maintained
silence longer than she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) knew, and the light was perceptibly fading. At
last she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can bear no more now.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hand, but then quickly
withdrew it saying, <div class="bookquote">``Stay. How do I know that I can see you again? I
cannot bear to be seen when I am in pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) drew forth a pocket-book, and taking out a letter said, <div class="bookquote">``This is
addressed to the banking-house in Mainz, where you are to go for your
grandfather's chest. It is a letter written by Joseph Kalonymos: if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>When Deronda had taken the letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said, with effort but more
gently than before, <div class="bookquote">``Kneel again, and let me kiss you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) obeyed, and holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) head between her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
solemnly on the brow. <div class="bookquote">``You see, I had no life left to love you with,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said, in a low murmur. <div class="bookquote">``But there is more fortune for you. Sir Hugo

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had needed anything I would have worked for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
conscious of disappointed yearning--a shutting out forever from long

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need nothing that the skill of man can give me,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother,
still holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) head, and perusing his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) features. <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps now I

<p/>Among Deronda's letters the next morning was one from Hans Meyrick of
four quarto pages, in the small, beautiful handwriting which ran in the
Meyrick family.

<p/>MY DEAR DERONDA,--In return for your sketch of Italian movements and
your view of the world's affairs generally, I may say that here at
home the most judicious opinion going as to the effects of present
causes is that <div class="bookquote">``time will show.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As to the present causes of past
effects, it is now seen that the late swindling telegrams account for
the last year's cattle plague--which is a refutation of philosophy
falsely so called, and justifies the compensation to the farmers. My
own idea that a murrain will shortly break out in the commercial
class, and that the cause will subsequently disclose itself in the
ready sale of all rejected pictures, has been called an unsound use of
analogy; but there are minds that will not hesitate to rob even the
neglected painter of his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) solace. To my feeling there is great beauty
in the conception that some bad judge might give a high price for my
Berenice series, and that the men in the city would have already been
punished for my ill-merited luck.

<p/>Meanwhile I am consoling myself for your absence by finding my
advantage in it--shining like Hesperus when Hyperion has departed;
sitting with our Hebrew prophet, and making a study of his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) head, in
the hours when he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) used to be occupied with you--getting credit with
him (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) as a learned young Gentile, who would have been a Jew if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) could
--and agreeing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) in the general principle, that whatever is
best is for that reason Jewish. I never held it my _forte_ to be
a severe reasoner, but I can see that if whatever is best is A, and B
happens to be best, B must be A, however little you might have
expected it beforehand. On that principle I could see the force of a
pamphlet I once read to prove that all good art was Protestant.
However, our prophet is an uncommonly interesting sitter--a better
model than Rembrandt had for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) Rabbi--and I never come away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>)
without a new discovery. For one thing, it is a constant wonder to me
that, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) fiery feeling for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) race and their traditions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>)
is no straight-laced Jew, spitting after the word Christian, and
enjoying the prospect that the Gentile mouth will water in vain for a
slice of the roasted Leviathan, while Israel will be sending up plates
for more, _ad libitum_, -LRB-You perceive that my studies had taught
me what to expect from the orthodox Jew.-RRB- I confess that I have always
held lightly by your account of Mordecai, as apologetic, and merely
part of your disposition to make an antedeluvian point of view lest
you should do injustice to the megatherium. But now I have given ear
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) proper person, I find him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) really a sort of
philosophical-allegorical-mystical believer, and yet with a sharp
dialectic point, so that any argumentative rattler of peas in a
bladder might soon be pricked in silence by him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). The mixture may be
one of the Jewish prerogatives, for what I know. In fact, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind
seems so broad that I find my own correct opinions lying in it quite
commodiously, and how they are to be brought into agreement with the
vast remainder is his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) affair, not mine. I leave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) to settle
our basis, never yet having seen a basis which is not a
world-supporting elephant, more or less powerful and expensive to keep.
My means will not allow me to keep a private elephant. I go into mystery
instead, as cheaper and more lasting--a sort of gas which is likely to
be continually supplied by the decomposition of the elephants. And if
I like the look of an opinion, I treat it civilly, without suspicious
inquiries. I have quite a friendly feeling toward Mordecai's notion
that a whole Christian is three-fourths a Jew, and that from the
Alexandrian time downward the most comprehensive minds have been
Jewish; for I think of pointing out to Mirah that, Arabic and other
incidents of life apart, there is really little difference between me
and--Maimonides. But I have lately been finding out that it is your
shallow lover who can't help making a declaration. If Mirah's ways
were less distracting, and it were less of a heaven to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
presence and watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), I must long ago have flung myself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) feet,
and requested her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) to tell me, with less indirectness, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
wished me to blow my brains out. I have a knack of hoping, which is as
good as an estate in reversion, if one can keep from the temptation of
turning it into certainty, which may spoil all. My Hope wanders among
the orchard blossoms, feels the warm snow falling on it through the
sunshine, and is in doubt of nothing; but, catching sight of Certainty
in the distance, sees an ugly Janus-faced deity, with a dubious wink
on the hither side of him (<font color='blue'><b>deity</b></font>), and turns quickly away. But you, with your
supreme reasonableness, and self-nullification, and preparation for
the worst--you know nothing about Hope, that immortal, delicious
maiden forever courted forever propitious, whom fools have called
deceitful, as if it were Hope that carried the cup of disappointment,
whereas it is her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) deadly enemy, Certainty, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) only escapes by
transformation. -LRB-You observe my new vein of allegory?-RRB- Seriously,
however, I must be permitted to allege that truth will prevail, that
prejudice will melt before it, that diversity, accompanied by merit,
will make itself felt as fascination, and that no virtuous aspiration
will be frustrated--all which, if I mistake not, are doctrines of the
schools, and they imply that the Jewess I prefer will prefer me. Any
blockhead can cite generalities, but the mind-master discerns the
particular cases they represent.

<p/>I am less convinced that my society makes amends to Mordecai for your
absence, but another substitute occasionally comes in the form of
Jacob Cohen. It is worth while to catch our prophet's expression when
he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) has that remarkable type of young Israel on his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) knee, and pours
forth some Semitic inspiration with a sublime look of melancholy
patience and devoutness. Sometimes it occurs to Jacob that Hebrew will
be more edifying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) stops his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) ears with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) palms, and
imitates the venerable sounds as heard through that muffled medium.
When Mordecai gently draws down the little fists and holds them fast,
Jacob's features all take on an extraordinary activity, very much as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was walking through a menagerie and trying to imitate every
animal in turn, succeeding best with the owl and the peccary. But I
dare say you have seen something of this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) treats me with the
easiest familiarity, and seems in general to look at me as a second-hand
Christian commodity, likely to come down in price; remarking on
my disadvantages with a frankness which seems to imply some thoughts
of future purchase. It is pretty, though, to see the change in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) if
Mirah happens to come in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) turns child suddenly--his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) age usually
strikes one as being like the Israelitish garments in the desert,
perhaps near forty, yet with an air of recent production. But, with
Mirah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) reminds me of the dogs that have been brought up by women,
and remain manageable by them only. Still, the dog is fond of Mordecai
too, and brings sugar-plums to share with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own mouth
to rather an embarrassing extent, and watching how Mordecai deals with
a smaller supply. Judging from this modern Jacob at the age of six, my
astonishment is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) race has not bought us all up long ago, and
pocketed our feebler generations in the form of stock and scrip, as so
much slave property. There is one Jewess I should not mind being slave
to. But I wish I did not imagine that Mirah gets a little sadder, and
tries all the while to hide it. It is natural enough, of course, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) has to watch the slow death of this brother, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) has taken to
worshipping with such looks of loving devoutness that I am ready to
wish myself in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) place.

<p/>For the rest, we are a little merrier than usual. Rex Gascoigne--you
remember a head you admired among my sketches, a fellow with a good
upper lip, reading law--has got some rooms in town now not far off us,
and has had a neat sister -LRB-upper lip also good-RRB- staying with him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) the
last fortnight. I have introduced them both to my mother and the
girls, who have found out from Miss Gascoigne that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) is cousin to
your Vandyke duchess!!! I put the notes of exclamation to mark the
surprise that the information at first produced on my feeble
understanding. On reflection I discovered that there was not the least
ground for surprise, unless I had beforehand believed that nobody
could be anybody's cousin without my knowing it. This sort of
surprise, I take it, depends on a liveliness of the spine, with a more
or less constant nullity of brain. There was a fellow I used to meet
at Rome who was in an effervescence of surprise at contact with the
simplest information. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) what you would--that you were fond of
easy boots--he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would always say, <div class="bookquote">``No! are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with the same energy
of wonder: the very fellow of whom pastoral Browne wrote
prophetically--

<p/>``A wretch so empty that if e'er there be
In nature found the least vacuity
<div class="bookquote">``Twill be in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Browne/Thomas Browne/THOMAS BROWNE</b></font>)</div><p/>I have accounted for it all--he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) had a lively spine.

<p/>However, this cousinship with the duchess came out by chance one day
that Mirah was with them at home and they were talking about the
Mallingers. _Apropos_; I am getting so important that I have
rival invitations. Gascoigne wants me to go down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)
father's rectory in August and see the country round there. But I
think self-interest well understood will take me to Topping Abbey, for
Sir Hugo has invited me, and proposes--God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rashness!
--that I should make a picture of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) three daughters sitting on a
bank--as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) says, in the Gainsborough style. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came to my studio the
other day and recommended me to apply myself to portrait. Of course I
know what that means.--<div class="bookquote">``My good fellow, your attempts at the historic
and poetic are simply pitiable. Your brush is just that of a
successful portrait-painter--it has a little truth and a great
facility in falsehood--your idealism will never do for gods and
goddesses and heroic story, but it may fetch a high price as flattery.
Fate, my friend, has made you the hinder wheel--_rota posterior
curras, et in axe secundo_--run behind, because you can't help it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>--What great effort it evidently costs our friends to give us these
candid opinions! I have even known a man to take the trouble to call,
in order to tell me that I had irretrievably exposed my want of
judgment in treating my subject, and that if I had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) we would
have lent me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own judgment. Such was my ingratitude and my
readiness at composition, that even while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was speaking I inwardly
sketched a Last Judgment with that candid friend's physiognomy on the
left. But all this is away from Sir Hugo, whose manner of implying
that one's gifts are not of the highest order is so exceedingly
good-natured and comfortable that I begin to feel it an advantage not
to be among those poor fellows at the tip-top. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) kindness to me
tastes all the better because it comes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) love for you, old
boy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) chat is uncommonly amusing. By the way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) told me that your
Vandyke duchess is gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) husband yachting to the Mediterranean.
I bethink me that it is possible to land from a yacht, or to be taken
on to a yacht from the land. Shall you by chance have an opportunity of
continuing your theological discussion with the fair Supralapsarian--I
think you said her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) tenets were of that complexion? Is Duke Alphonso
also theological?--perhaps an Arian who objects to triplicity. -LRB-Stage
direction. While D. is reading, a profound scorn gathers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arian</b></font>) face
till at the last word he (<font color='blue'><b>Arian</b></font>) flings down the letter, grasps his (<font color='blue'><b>Arian</b></font>) coat-collar
in a statuesque attitude and so remains with a look generally
tremendous, throughout the following soliloquy, <div class="bookquote">``O night, O blackness,
etc., etc.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/>Excuse the brevity of this letter. You are not used to more from me
than a bare statement of facts, without comment or digression. One
fact I have omitted--that the Klesmers on the eve of departure have
behaved magnificently, shining forth as might be expected from the
planets of genius and fortune in conjunction. Mirah is rich with their
oriental gifts.

<p/>What luck it will be if you come back and present yourself at the
Abbey while I am there! I am going to behave with consummate
discretion and win golden opinions, But I shall run up to town now and
then, just for a peep into Gad Eden. You see how far I have got in
Hebrew lore--up with my Lord Bolingbroke, who knew no Hebrew, but
<div class="bookquote">``understood that sort of learning and what is writ about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>If Mirah
commanded, I would go to a depth below the tri-literal roots. Already
it makes no difference to me whether the points are there or not. But
while her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) brother's life lasts I suspect she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would not listen to a
lover, even one whose <div class="bookquote">``hair is like a flock of goats on Mount
Gilead'' (<font color='red'><b>a lover</b></font>)</div>--and I flatter myself that few heads would bear that trying
comparison better than mine. So I stay with my hope among the
orchard-blossoms.

<p/>Your devoted,

<p/>HANS MEYRICK.

<p/>Some months before, this letter from Hans would have divided Deronda's
thoughts irritatingly: its romancing, about Mirah would have had an
unpleasant edge, scarcely anointed with any commiseration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
friend's probable disappointment. But things had altered since March.
Mirah was no longer so critically placed with regard to the Meyricks,
and Deronda's own position had been undergoing a change which had just
been crowned by the revelation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) birth. The new opening toward the
future, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would not trust in any definite visions, inevitably
shed new lights, and influenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mood toward past and present;
hence, what Hans called his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) hope now seemed to Deronda, not a
mischievous unreasonableness which roused his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) indignation, but an
unusually persistent bird-dance of an extravagant fancy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would
have felt quite able to pity any consequent suffering of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) friend's,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had believed in the suffering as probable. But some of the busy
thought filling that long day, which passed without his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) receiving any
new summons from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother, was given to the argument that Hans
Meyrick's nature was not one in which love could strike the deep roots
that turn disappointment into sorrow: it was too restless, too readily
excitable by novelty, too ready to turn itself into imaginative
material, and wear its grief as a fantastic costume. <div class="bookquote">``Already he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is
beginning to play at love: he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is taking the whole affair as a comedy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda to himself; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knows very well that there is no chance
for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Just like him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--never opening his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes on any possible
objection I could have to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) outpourings about Mirah. Poor old
Hans! If we were under a fiery hail together he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) would howl like a
Greek, and if I did not howl too it would never occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) that I was
as badly off as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>). And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) is tender-hearted and affectionate in
intention, and I can't say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) is not active in imagining what goes
on in other people--but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) always imagines it to fit his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) own
inclination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>With this touch of causticity Deronda got rid of the slight heat at
present raised by Hans's naive expansiveness. The nonsense about
Gwendolen, conveying the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was gone yachting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
husband, only suggested a disturbing sequel to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own strange parting
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). But there was one sentence in the letter which raised a more
immediate, active anxiety. Hans's suspicion of a hidden sadness in
Mirah was not in the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) wishes, and hence, instead of
distrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) observation here, Deronda began to conceive a cause for
the sadness. Was it some event that had occurred during his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) absence, or
only the growing fear of some event? Was it something, perhaps
alterable, in the new position which had been made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)? Or--had
Mordecai, against his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) habitual resolve, communicated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) those
peculiar cherished hopes about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), Deronda, and had her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) quickly
sensitive nature been hurt by the discovery that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brother's will or
tenacity of visionary conviction had acted coercively on their
friendship--been hurt by the fear that there was more of pitying
self-suppression than of equal regard in Deronda's relation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)? For
amidst all Mirah's quiet renunciation, the evident thirst of soul with
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) received the tribute of equality implied a corresponding pain
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had taken for a purely reverential regard
toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brother had its mixture of condescension.

<p/>In this last conjecture of Deronda's he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not wrong as to the quality
in Mirah's nature on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was founding--the latent protest against
the treatment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life being subject to until she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).
For that gratitude which would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pass by any notice of their
acquaintance without insisting on the depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) debt to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), took
half its fervor from the keen comparison with what others had thought
enough to render to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Deronda's affinity in feeling enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to
penetrate such secrets. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not near the truth in admitting the
idea that Mordecai had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) characteristic reticence. To no soul
but Deronda himself had he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) yet breathed the history of their relation
to each other, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) confidence about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) friend's origin: it was not
only that these subjects were for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) too sacred to be spoken of
without weighty reason, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had discerned Deronda's shrinking
at any mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) birth; and the severity of reserve which had
hindered Mordecai from answering a question on a private affair of the
Cohen family told yet more strongly here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ezra, how is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>Mirah one day said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``I am continually going
to speak to Mr. Deronda as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) were a Jew?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cohen</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) quietly, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is because he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) treats
us as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) were our brother. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) loves not to have the difference
of birth dwelt upon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) has never lived with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) parents, Mr. Hans, says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>continued Mirah,
to whom this was necessarily a question of interest about every one for
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had a regard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seek not to know such things from Mr. Hans,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, gravely,
laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) curls, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was wont. <div class="bookquote">``What Daniel Deronda
wishes us to know about himself is for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to tell us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>And Mirah felt herself rebuked, as Deronda had done. But to be rebuked
in this way by Mordecai made her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rather proud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see no one so great as my brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said to Mrs. Meyrick one day
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) called at the Chelsea house on her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) way home, and, according to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hope, found the little mother alone. <div class="bookquote">``It is difficult to think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) belongs to the same world as those people I used to live amongst. I
told you once that they made life seem like a madhouse; but when I am
with Ezra he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) makes me feel that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) life is a great good, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) has
suffered so much; not like me, who wanted to die because I had suffered
a little, and only for a little while. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) soul is so full, it is
impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) to wish for death as I did. I get the same sort of
feeling from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) that I got yesterday, when I was tired, and came home
through the park after the sweet rain had fallen and the sunshine lay
on the grass and flowers. Everything in the sky and under the sky
looked so pure and beautiful that the weariness and trouble and folly
seemed only a small part of what is, and I became more patient and
hopeful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>A dove-like note of melancholy in this speech caused Mrs. Meyrick to
look at Mirah with new examination. After laying down her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hat and
pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) curls flat, with an air of fatigue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) placed herself on a
chair opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) friend in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) habitual attitude, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) feet and hands
just crossed; and at a distance she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) might have seemed a colored statue
of serenity. But Mrs. Meyrick discerned a new look of suppressed
suffering in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) face, which corresponded to the hint that to be
patient and hopeful required some extra influence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any fresh trouble on your mind, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick,
giving up her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) needlework as a sign of concentrated attention.

<p/>Mirah hesitated before she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am too ready to speak of troubles,
I think. It seems unkind to put anything painful into other people's
minds, unless one were sure it would hinder something worse. And
perhaps I am too hasty and fearful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, mothers are made to like pain and trouble for the sake of
their children. Is it because the singing lessons are so few, and are
likely to fall off when the season comes to an end? Success in these
things can't come all at once.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Meyrick did not believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
was touching the real grief; but a guess that could be corrected would
make an easier channel for confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) head gently. <div class="bookquote">``I have been a
little disappointed because so many ladies said they wanted me to give
them or their daughters lessons, and then I never heard of them again,
But perhaps after the holidays I shall teach in some schools. Besides,
you know, I am as rich as a princess now. I have not touched the
hundred pounds that Mrs. Klesmer gave me; and I should never be afraid
that Ezra would be in want of anything, because there is Mr. Deronda,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It is the chief honor of my life that your brother will
share anything with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oh, no! Ezra and I can have no fears for each
other about such things as food and clothing.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is some other fear on your mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick not
without divination--<div class="bookquote">``a fear of something that may disturb your peace;
Don't be forecasting evil, dear child, unless it is what you can guard
against. Anxiety is good for nothing if we can't turn it into a
defense. But there's no defense against all the things that might be.
Have you any more reason for being anxious now than you had a month
ago?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah. <div class="bookquote">``I have kept it from Ezra. I have not dared
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>). Pray forgive me that I can't do without telling you. I
_have_ more reason for being anxious. It is five days ago now. I am
quite sure I saw my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Meyrick shrank into a smaller space, packing her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) arms across her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
chest and leaning forward--to hinder herself from pelting that father
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) worst epithets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The year has changed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>Mirah went on. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had already been much
altered and worn in the time before I left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). You remember I said how
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) used sometimes to cry. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was always excited one way or the other. I
have told Ezra everything that I told you, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) says that my father
had taken to gambling, which makes people easily distressed, and then
again exalted. And now--it was only a moment that I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face
was more haggard, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) clothes were shabby. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was with a much
worse-looking man, who carried something, and they were hurrying along
after an omnibus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, child, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not see you, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No. I had just come from Mrs. Raymond's, and I was waiting to cross
near the Marble Arch. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was on the omnibus and gone out of sight.
It was a dreadful moment. My old life seemed to have come back again,
and it was worse than it had ever been before. And I could not help
feeling it a new deliverance that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was gone out of sight without
knowing that I was there. And yet it hurt me that I was feeling so--it
seemed hateful in me--almost like words I once had to speak in a play,
that ``I had warmed my hands in the blood of my kindred.'' For where
might my father be going? What may become of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? And his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) having a
daughter who would own him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in spite of all, might have hindered the
worst. Is there any pain like seeing what ought to be the best things
in life turned into the worst? All those opposite feelings were meeting
and pressing against each other, and took up all my strength. No one
could act that. Acting is slow and poor to what we go through within. I
don't know how I called a cab. I only remember that I was in it when I
began to think, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell Ezra; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) must not know.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are afraid of grieving him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Meyrick asked, when Mirah had
paused a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--and there is something more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, hesitatingly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
were examining her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) feeling before she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) would venture to speak of it. <div class="bookquote">``I
want to tell you; I cannot tell any one else. I could not have told my
own mother: I should have closed it up before her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I feel shame for my
father, and it is perhaps strange--but the shame is greater before Ezra
than before any one else in the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) desired me to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) all
about my life, and I obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>). But it is always like a smart to me to
know that those things about my father are in Ezra's mind. And--can you
believe it? when the thought haunts me how it would be if my father
were to come and show himself before us both, what seems as if it would
scorch me most is seeing my father shrinking before Ezra. That is the
truth. I don't know whether it is a right feeling. But I can't help
thinking that I would rather try to maintain my father in secret, and
bear a great deal in that way, if I could hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from meeting my
brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not encourage that feeling, Mirah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick,
hastily. <div class="bookquote">``It would be very dangerous; it would be wrong. You must not
have concealment of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But ought I now to tell Ezra that I have seen my father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah,
with deprecation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Meyrick answered, dubitatively. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that it is
necessary to do that. Your father may go away with the birds. It is not
clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came after you; you may never see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again. And then
your brother will have been spared a useless anxiety. But promise me
that if your father sees you--gets hold of you in any way again--and
you will let us all know. Promise me that solemnly, Mirah. I have a
right to ask it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah reflected a little, then leaned forward to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hands in Mrs.
Meyrick's, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Since you ask it, I do promise. I will bear this
feeling of shame. I have been so long used to think that I must bear
that sort of inward pain. But the shame for my father burns me more
when I think of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meeting Ezra.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was silent a moment or two, and
then said, in a new tone of yearning compassion, <div class="bookquote">``And we are his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
children--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) was once young like us--and my mother loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>). Oh! I
cannot help seeing it all close, and it hurts me like a cruelty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah shed no tears: the discipline of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) whole life had been against
indulgence in such manifestation, which soon falls under the control of
strong motives; but it seemed that the more intense expression of
sorrow had entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) voice. Mrs. Meyrick, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) quickness
and loving insight, did not quite understand that filial feeling in
Mirah which had active roots deep below her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) indignation for the worst
offenses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) could conceive that a mother would have a clinging pity
and shame for a reprobate son, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was out of patience with what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) held an exaggerated susceptibility on behalf of this father, whose
reappearance inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) to wish him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) under the care of a turnkey.
Mirah's promise, however, was some security against her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) weakness.

<p/>That incident was the only reason that Mirah herself could have stated
for the hidden sadness which Hans had divined. Of one element in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
changed mood she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) could have given no definite account: it was something
as dim as the sense of approaching weather-change, and had extremely
slight external promptings, such as we are often ashamed to find all we
can allege in support of the busy constructions that go on within us,
not only without effort, but even against it, under the influence of
any blind emotional stirring. Perhaps the first leaven of uneasiness
was laid by Gwendolen's behavior on that visit which was entirely
superfluous as a means of engaging Mirah to sing, and could have no
other motive than the excited and strange questioning about Deronda.
Mirah had instinctively kept the visit a secret, but the active
remembrance of it had raised a new susceptibility in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
alive as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never been before to the relations Deronda must have
with that society which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) herself was getting frequent glimpses of
without belonging to it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) peculiar life and education had produced
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) an extraordinary mixture of unworldliness, with knowledge of the
world's evil, and even this knowledge was a strange blending of direct
observation with the effects of reading and theatrical study. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
memory was furnished with abundant passionate situation and intrigue,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) never made emotionally her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own, but felt a repelled aloofness
from, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had done from the actual life around her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Some of that
imaginative knowledge began now to weave itself around Mrs. Grandcourt;
and though Mirah would admit no position likely to affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) reverence
for Deronda, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could not avoid a new painfully vivid association of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) general life with a world away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own, where there might be
some involvement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) feeling and action with a woman like Gwendolen,
who was increasingly repugnant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--increasingly, even after she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
ceased to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); for liking and disliking can grow in meditation as
fast as in the more immediate kind of presence. Any disquietude
consciously due to the idea that Deronda's deepest care might be for
something remote not only from herself but even from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) friendship for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have checked with rebuking questions:--What was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) but one who had shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) generous kindness with many others? and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brother, was it not begun late to be soon ended?
Other ties had come before, and others would remain after this had been
cut by swift-coming death. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uneasiness had not reached that
point of self-recognition in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have been ashamed of it as
an indirect, presumptuous claim on Deronda's feeling. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) or any
one else should think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) possible lover was a conception
which had never entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind; indeed it was equally out of the
question with Mrs. Meyrick and the girls, who with Mirah herself
regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) intervention in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) life as something exceptional, and
were so impressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mission as her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) deliverer and guardian that
they would have held it an offense to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) holding any other
relation toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>): a point of view which Hans also had readily
adopted. It is a little hard upon some men that they appear to sink for
us in becoming lovers. But precisely to this innocence of the Meyricks
was owing the disturbance of Mirah's unconsciousness. The first
occasion could hardly have been more trivial, but it prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
emotive nature for a deeper effect from what happened afterward.

<p/>It was when Anna Gascoigne, visiting the Meyricks; was led to speak of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) cousinship with Gwendolen. The visit had been arranged that Anna
might see Mirah; the three girls were at home with their mother, and
there was naturally a flux of talk among six feminine creatures, free
from the presence of a distorting male standard. Anna Gascoigne felt
herself much at home with the Meyrick girls, who knew what it was to
have a brother, and to be generally regarded as of minor importance in
the world; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) had told Rex that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) thought the University very
nice, because brothers made friends there whose families were not rich
and grand, and yet -LRB-like the University-RRB- were very nice. The Meyricks
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) almost alarmingly clever, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) consulted them much on
the best mode of teaching Lotta, confiding to them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) herself was
the least clever of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) family. Mirah had lately come in, and there was
a complete bouquet of young faces around the tea-table--Hafiz, seated a
little aloft with large eyes on the alert, regarding the whole scene as
an apparatus for supplying his (<font color='blue'><b>Hafiz</b></font>) allowance of milk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of our surprise, Mirah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate. <div class="bookquote">``We were speaking of Mr.
Deronda and the Mallingers, and it turns out that Miss Gascoigne knows
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only knew about them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna, a little flushed with excitement,
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had heard and now saw of the lovely Jewess being an almost
startling novelty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have not even seen them. But some months
ago, my cousin married Sir Hugo Mallinger's nephew, Mr. Grandcourt, who
lived in Sir Hugo's place at Diplow, near us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mab, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Something must come of
that. Mrs. Grandcourt, the Vandyke duchess, is your cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; I was her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) bridesmaid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mamma and mine are
sisters. My aunt was much richer before last year, but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) and
mamma lost all their fortune. Papa is a clergyman, you know, so it
makes very little difference to us, except that we keep no carriage,
and have no dinner parties--and I like it better. But it was very sad
for poor Aunt Davilow, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) could not live with us, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) has
four daughters besides Gwendolen; but then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) married Mr.
Grandcourt, it did not signify so much, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) being so rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, this finding out relationships is delightful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab. <div class="bookquote">``It is
like a Chinese puzzle that one has to fit together. I feel sure
something wonderful may be made of it, but I can't tell what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, Mab,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Amy, <div class="bookquote">``relationships must branch out. The only
difference is, that we happen to know some of the people concerned.
Such things are going on every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray, Amy, why do you insist on the number nine being so
wonderful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure that is happening every day. Never
mind, Miss Gascoigne; please go on. And Mr. Deronda?--have you never
seen Mr. Deronda? You _must_ bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna; ``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was at Diplow before my
cousin was married, and I have heard my aunt speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to papa.
She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said what you have been saying about him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)--only not so much: I mean,
about Mr. Deronda living with Sir Hugo Mallinger, and being so nice,
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) thought. We talk a great deal about every one who comes near
Pennicote, because it is so seldom there is any one new. But I
remember, when I asked Gwendolen what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought of Mr. Deronda, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
said, ``Don't mention it, Anna: but I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hair is dark.<div class="bookquote">'' That was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) droll way of answering: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was always so lively. It is really
rather wonderful that I should come to hear so much about him (<font color='blue'><b>Hafiz</b></font>), all
through Mr. Hans knowing Rex, and then my having the pleasure of
knowing you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Anna ended, looking at Mrs. Meyrick with a shy grace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The pleasure is on our side too; but the wonder would have been, if
you had come to this house without hearing of Mr. Deronda--wouldn't it,
Mirah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick.

<p/>Mirah smiled acquiescently, but had nothing to say. A confused
discontent took possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) at the mingling of names and images
to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had been listening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My son calls Mrs. Grandcourt the Vandyke duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs.
Meyrick, turning again to Anna; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) so striking and
picturesque.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna. <div class="bookquote">``Gwendolen was always so beautiful--people fell
dreadfully in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). I thought it a pity, because it made them
unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you like Mr. Grandcourt, the happy lover?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Meyrick, who, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) way, was as much interested as Mab in the hints
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had been hearing of vicissitude in the life of a widow with
daughters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa approved of Gwendolen's accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), and my aunt says he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is
very generous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Anna, beginning with a virtuous intention of
repressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own sentiments; but then, unable to resist a rare
occasion for speaking them freely, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on--<div class="bookquote">``else I should have
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) was not very nice--rather proud, and not at all lively, like
Gwendolen. I should have thought some one younger and more lively would
have suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) better. But, perhaps, having a brother who seems to us
better than any one makes us think worse of others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait till you see Mr. Deronda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, nodding significantly.
<div class="bookquote">``Nobody's brother will do after him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our brothers _must_ do for people's husbands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, curtly,
<div class="bookquote">``because they will not get Mr. Deronda. No woman will do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to
marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No woman ought to want him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, with indignation.
<div class="bookquote">''_I_ never should. Fancy finding out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mab</b></font>) had a tailor's bill, and
used boot-hooks, like Hans. Who ever thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) marrying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate. ``When I drew a wedding for a frontispiece to
``Hearts and Diamonds,<div class="bookquote">'' I made a sort of likeness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) for the
bridegroom, and I went about looking for a grand woman who would do for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) countess, but I saw none that would not be poor creatures by the
side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hearts</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have seen this Mrs. Grandcourt then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick.
<div class="bookquote">``Hans says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) and Mr. Deronda set each other off when they are
side by side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is tall and fair. But you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), Mirah--you can
always say something descriptive. What do _you_ think of Mrs.
Grandcourt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is the _Princess of Eboli_ in _Don Carlos_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah,
with a quick intensity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) was pursuing an association in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) own mind
not intelligible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) hearers--an association with a certain actress
as well as the part she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) represented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your comparison is a riddle for me, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick,
smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said that Mrs. Grandcourt was tall and fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>continued Mirah,
slightly paler. <div class="bookquote">``That is quite true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Meyrick's quick eye and ear detected something unusual, but
immediately explained it to herself. Fine ladies had often wounded
Mirah by caprices of manner and intention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Grandcourt had thought of having lessons of Mirah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) said
turning to Anna. <div class="bookquote">``But many have talked of having lessons, and then have
found no time. Fashionable ladies have too much work to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>And the chat went on without further insistance on the _Princess of
Eboli_. That comparison escaped Mirah's lips under the urgency of a
pang unlike anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had felt before. The conversation from the
beginning had revived unpleasant impressions, and Mrs. Meyrick's
suggestion of Gwendolen's figure by the side of Deronda's had the
stinging effect of a voice outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>), confirming her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) secret
conviction that this tall and fair woman had some hold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) lot. For
a long while afterward she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had had a jarring shock
through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) frame.

<p/>In the evening, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother's shoulder as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was sitting by him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sat propped up in bed under a new
difficulty of breathing, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ezra, does it ever hurt your love for Mr. Deronda that so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
life was all hidden away from you--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is amongst persons and cares
about persons who are all so unlike us--I mean unlike you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, assuredly no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai. <div class="bookquote">``Rather it is a precious thought to
me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) has a preparation which I lacked, and is an accomplished
Egyptian.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Then, recollecting that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) words had reference which his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
sister must not yet understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``I have the more to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>),
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) treasure differs from mine. That is a blessedness in
friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah mused a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it would be a trial to your love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) if that
other part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life were like a crowd in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had got entangled,
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was carried away from you--I mean in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thoughts, and not
merely carried out of sight as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is now--and not merely for a little
while, but continually. How should you bear that! Our religion commands
us to bear. But how should you bear it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not well, my sister--not well; but it will never happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said
Mordecai, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with a tender smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) heart
needed comfort on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) account.

<p/>Mirah said no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mused over the difference between her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own state
of mind and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother's, and felt her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) comparative pettiness. Why
could she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) not be completely satisfied with what satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) larger
judgment? She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gave herself no fuller reason than a painful sense of
unfitness--in what? Airy possibilities to which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could give no
outline, but to which one name and one figure gave the wandering
persistency of a blot in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) vision. Here lay the vaguer source of the
hidden sadness rendered noticeable to Hans by some diminution of that
sweet ease, that ready joyousness of response in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) speech and smile,
which had come with the new sense of freedom and safety, and had made
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) presence like the freshly-opened daisies and clear bird-notes after
the rain. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) herself regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uneasiness as a sort of ingratitude
and dullness of sensibility toward the great things that had been given
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) new life; and whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) threw more energy than usual into
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) singing, it was the energy of indignation against the shallowness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own content. In that mood she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) once said, <div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you what
is the difference between you and me, Ezra? You are a spring in the
drought, and I am an acorn-cup; the waters of heaven fill me, but the
least little shake leaves me empty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what has shaken thee?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) fell into this antique
form of speech habitually in talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) sister and to the Cohen
children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thoughts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah; <div class="bookquote">``thoughts that come like the breeze and shake
me--bad people, wrong things, misery--and how they might touch our
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must take our portion, Mirah. It is there. On whose shoulder would
we lay it, that we might be free?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The one voluntary sign she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) made of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) inward care was this distant
allusion.




<p/>CHAPTER LIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My desolation does begin to make
A better life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--SHAKESPEARE: _Antony and Cleopatra._


<p/>Before Deronda was summoned to a second interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother, a
day had passed in which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had only sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) a message to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was not yet well enough to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) again; but on the third morning
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had a note saying, <div class="bookquote">``I leave to-day. Come and see me at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was shown into the same room as before; but it was much darkened
with blinds and curtains. The Princess was not there, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) presently
entered, dressed in a loose wrap of some soft silk, in color a dusky
orange, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) head again with black lace floating about it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) arms
showing themselves bare from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wide sleeves. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) face seemed
even more impressive in the sombre light, the eyes larger, the lines
more vigorous. You might have imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) a sorceress who would
stretch forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wonderful hand and arm to mix youth-potions for
others, but scorned to mix them for herself, having had enough of youth.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) arms on her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) son's shoulders at once, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) on both
cheeks, then seated herself among her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) cushions with an air of assured
firmness and dignity unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) fitfulness in their first interview,
and told Deronda to sit down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) obeyed, saying, <div class="bookquote">``You are quite
relieved now, I trust?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am at ease again. Is there anything more that you would like to
ask me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said, with the matter of a queen rather than of a mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I find the house in Genoa where you used to live with my
grandfather?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered, with a deprecating movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``it is
pulled down--not to be found. But about our family, and where my father
lived at various times--you will find all that among the papers in the
chest, better than I can tell you. My father, I told you, was a
physician. My mother was a Morteira. I used to hear all those things
without listening. You will find them all. I was born amongst them
without my will. I banished them as soon as I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda tried to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) pained feeling, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Anything else that
I should desire to know from you could only be what it is some
satisfaction to your own feeling to tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I have told you everything that could be demanded of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said
the Princess, looking coldly meditative. It seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had
exhausted her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) emotion in their former interview. The fact was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had
said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``I have done it all. I have confessed all. I will not
go through it again. I will save myself from agitation.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was
acting out that scheme.

<p/>But to Deronda's nature the moment was cruel; it made the filial
yearning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life a disappointed pilgrimage to a shrine where there
were no longer the symbols of sacredness. It seemed that all the woman
lacking in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was present in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, with some tremor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then are we to part and I never be anything to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is better so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess, in a softer, mellower voice.
<div class="bookquote">``There could be nothing but hard duty for you, even if it were possible
for you to take the place of my son. You would not love me. Don't deny
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said, abruptly, putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I know what is the
truth. You don't like what I did. You are angry with me. You think I
robbed you of something. You are on your grandfather's side, and you
will always have a condemnation of me in your heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda felt himself under a ban of silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) seat by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), preferring to stand, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had to obey that imperious prohibition
of any tenderness. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother now looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with a new
admiration in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) glance, saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are wrong to be angry with me. You are the better for what I did.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>After pausing a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) added, abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``And now tell me what you
shall do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean now, immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda; <div class="bookquote">``or as to the course of
my future life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean in the future. What difference will it make to you that I have
told you about your birth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very great difference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, emphatically. <div class="bookquote">``I can hardly
think of anything that would make a greater difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall you do then?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess, with more sharpness. <div class="bookquote">``Make
yourself just like your grandfather--be what he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) wished you--turn
yourself into a Jew like him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is impossible. The effect of my education can never be done away
with. The Christian sympathies in which my mind was reared can never
die out of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with increasing tenacity of tone. <div class="bookquote">``But I
consider it my duty--it is the impulse of my feeling--to identify
myself, as far as possible, with my hereditary people, and if I can see
any work to be done for them that I can give my soul and hand to I
shall choose to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with a wondering speculation,
examining his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought that by close attention she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could
read a difficult language there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) bore her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gaze very firmly,
sustained by a resolute opposition, which was the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
fullest self. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bent toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) a little, and said, with a decisive
emphasis--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are in love with a Jewess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda colored and said, <div class="bookquote">``My reasons would be independent of any such
fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know better. I have seen what men are,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess,
peremptorily. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me the truth. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is a Jewess who will not accept
any one but a Jew. There _are_ a few such,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) added, with a touch of
scorn.

<p/>Deronda had that objection to answer which we all have known in
speaking to those who are too certain of their own fixed
interpretations to be enlightened by anything we may say. But besides
this, the point immediately in question was one on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt a
repugnance either to deny or affirm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) remained silent, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
presently said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You love her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) as your father loved me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) draws you after her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) as I
drew him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Those words touched Deronda's filial imagination, and some tenderness
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) glance was taken by his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother as an assent. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went on with
rising passion: <div class="bookquote">``But I was leading him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the other way. And now your
grandfather is getting his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) revenge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, remonstrantly, <div class="bookquote">``don't let us think of it in
that way. I will admit that there may come some benefit from the
education you chose for me. I prefer cherishing the benefit with
gratitude, to dwelling with resentment on the injury. I think it would
have been right that I should have been brought up with the
consciousness that I was a Jew, but it must always have been a good to
me to have as wide an instruction and sympathy as possible. And now,
you have restored me my inheritance--events have brought a fuller
restitution than you could have made--you have been saved from robbing
my people of my service and me of my duty: can you not bring your whole
soul to consent to this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) pleading: his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) listeningly,
as if the cadence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) voice were taking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ear, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
head slowly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) began again, even more urgently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have told me that you sought what you held the best for me: open
your heart to relenting and love toward my grandfather, who sought what
he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) held the best for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for me, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head with more absolute denial,
and folding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms tightly. ``I tell you, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) never thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
daughter except as an instrument. Because I had wants outside his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
purpose, I was to be put in a frame and tortured. If that is the right
law for the world, I will not say that I love it. If my acts were
wrong--if it is God who is exacting from me that I should deliver up
what I withheld--who is punishing me because I deceived my father and
did not warn him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that I should contradict his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trust--well, I have told
everything. I have done what I could. And _your_ soul consents. That is
enough. I have after all been the instrument my father wanted.--<div class="bookquote">``I
desire a grandson who shall have a true Jewish heart. Every Jew should
rear his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) family as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hoped that a Deliverer might spring from it.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>In uttering these last sentences the Princess narrowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) eyes, waved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) head up and down, and spoke slowly with a new kind of chest-voice,
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) were quoting unwillingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were those my grandfather's words?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; and you will find them written. I wanted to thwart him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess, with a sudden outburst of the passion she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had shown
in the former interview. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) added more slowly, <div class="bookquote">``You would have me
love what I have hated from the time I was so high'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--here she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
left hand a yard from the floor.--<div class="bookquote">``That can never be. But what does it
matter? His (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) yoke has been on me, whether I loved it or not. You are the
grandson he (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) wanted. You speak as men do--as if you felt yourself wise.
What does it all mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) tone was abrupt and scornful. Deronda, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) pained feeling, and
under the solemn urgency of the moment, had to keep a clutching
remembrance of their relationship, lest his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) words should become cruel.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) began in a deep entreating tone:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, don't say that I feel myself wise. We are set in the midst of
difficulties. I see no other way to get any clearness than by being
truthful--not by keeping back facts which may--which should carry
obligation within them--which should make the only guidance toward
duty. No wonder if such facts come to reveal themselves in spite of
concealments. The effects prepared by generations are likely to triumph
over a contrivance which would bend them all to the satisfaction of
self. Your will was strong, but my grandfather's trust which you
accepted and did not fulfill--what you call his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) yoke--is the expression
of something stronger, with deeper, farther-spreading roots, knit into
the foundations of sacredness for all men. You renounced me--you still
banish me--as a son'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--there was an involuntary movement of indignation
in Deronda's voice--<div class="bookquote">``But that stronger Something has determined that I
shall be all the more the grandson whom also you willed to annihilate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) fixedly, and again her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face gathered
admiration. After a moment's silence she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, in a low, persuasive
tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) obeyed, placing himself beside her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laid
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shoulder and went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You rebuke me. Well--I am the loser. And you are angry because I
banish you. What could you do for me but weary your own patience? Your
mother is a shattered woman. My sense of life is little more than a
sense of what was--except when the pain is present. You reproach me
that I parted with you. I had joy enough without you then. Now you are
come back to me, and I cannot make you a joy. Have you the cursing
spirit of the Jew in you? Are you not able to forgive me? Shall you be
glad to think that I am punished because I was not a Jewish mother to
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you ask me that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, remonstrantly. <div class="bookquote">``Have I not
besought you that I might now at least be a son to you? My grief is
that you have declared me helpless to comfort you. I would give up much
that is dear for the sake of soothing your anguish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall give up nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother, with the hurry of
agitation. <div class="bookquote">``You shall be happy. You shall let me think of you as happy.
I shall have done you no harm. You have no reason to curse me. You
shall feel for me as they feel for the dead whom they say prayers
for--you shall long that I may be freed from all suffering--from all
punishment. And I shall see you instead of always seeing your
grandfather. Will any harm come to me because I broke his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) trust in the
daylight after he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was gone into darkness? I cannot tell:--if you think
_Kaddish_ will help me--say it, say it. You will come between me and
the dead. When I am in your mind, you will look as you do now--always
as if you were a tender son--always--as if I had been a tender mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed resolved that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) agitation should not conquer her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
felt her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand trembling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shoulder. Deep, deep compassion hemmed
in all words. With a face of beseeching he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and
pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head tenderly under his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). They sat so for some moments. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head again and rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seat with a great sigh, as
if in that breath she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were dismissing a weight of thoughts. Deronda,
standing in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), felt that the parting was near. But one of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) swift alternations had come upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beautiful?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, abruptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, changing color.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The woman you love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not a moment for deliberate explanation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was obliged to say,
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not ambitious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I think not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not one who must have a path of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nature is not given to make great claims.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is not like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess, taking from her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wallet a
miniature with jewels around it, and holding it before her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) son. It was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) own in all the fire of youth, and as Deronda looked at it with
admiring sadness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Had I not a rightful claim to be something
more than a mere daughter and mother? The voice and the genius matched
the face. Whatever else was wrong, acknowledge that I had a right to be
an artist, though my father's will was against it. My nature gave me a
charter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do acknowledge that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, looking from the miniature to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) face, which even in its worn pallor had an expression of living
force beyond anything that the pencil could show.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you take the portrait?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess, more gently. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
is a kind woman, teach her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to think of me kindly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be grateful for the portrait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``but--I ought to
say, I have no assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whom I love will have any love for
me. I have kept silence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who and what is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother. The question seemed a command.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was brought up as a singer for the stage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with
inward reluctance. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father took her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) away early from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life has been unhappy. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is very young--only twenty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father
wished to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up in disregard--even in dislike of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Jewish
origin, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has clung with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) affection to the memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
mother and the fellowship of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, like you. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is attached to the Judaism she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knows nothing of,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess, peremptorily. <div class="bookquote">``That is poetry--fit to last through
an opera night. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) artist's life--is her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) singing worth
anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) singing is exquisite. But her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice is not suited to the stage. I
think that the artist's life has been made repugnant to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is made for you then. Sir Hugo said you were bitterly against
being a singer, and I can see that you would never have let yourself be
merged in a wife, as your father was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I repeat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, emphatically--<div class="bookquote">``I repeat that I have no
assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) love for me, of the possibility that we can ever be
united. Other things--painful issues may lie before me. I have always
felt that I should prepare myself to renounce, not cherish that
prospect. But I suppose I might feel so of happiness in general.
Whether it may come or not, one should try and prepare one's self to do
without it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you feel in that way?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
shoulders, and perusing his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) spoke in a low meditative
tone, pausing between her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) sentences. <div class="bookquote">``Poor boy!--I wonder how it
would have been if I had kept you with me--whether you would have
turned your heart to the old things against mine--and we should have
quarreled--your grandfather would have been in you--and you would
have hampered my life with your young growth from the old root.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think my affection might have lasted through all our quarreling,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, saddened more and more, <div class="bookquote">``and that would not have
hampered--surely it would have enriched your life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not then, not then--I did not want it then--I might have been glad
of it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, with a bitter melancholy, <div class="bookquote">``if I could have
been glad of anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you love your other children, and they love you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered, as to a question about a matter of course,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) folded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms again. <div class="bookquote">``But,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) added in a deeper
tone,--<div class="bookquote">``I am not a loving woman. That is the truth. It is a talent to
love--I lack it. Others have loved me--and I have acted their love. I
know very well what love makes of men and women--it is subjection. It
takes another for a larger self, enclosing this one,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pointed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own bosom. <div class="bookquote">``I was never willingly subject to any man. Men have been
subject to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the man who was subject was the happier of the two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda--not with a smile, but with a grave, sad sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother's
privation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps--but I _was_ happy--for a few years I was happy. If I had not
been afraid of defeat and failure, I might have gone on. I
miscalculated. What then? It is all over. Another life! Men talk of
`another life,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as if it only began on the other side of the grave. I
have long entered on another life.'' With the last words she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
arms till they were bare to the elbow, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brow was contracted in one
deep fold, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes were closed, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice was smothered: in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dusky
flame-colored garment, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked like a dreamed visitant from some
region of departed mortals.

<p/>Deronda's feeling was wrought to a pitch of acuteness in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
no longer quite master of himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) gave an audible sob. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother,
opened her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes, and letting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands again rest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shoulders,
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, my son, good-bye. We shall hear no more of each other. Kiss
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neck, and they kissed each other.

<p/>Deronda did not know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) got out of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt an older man.
All his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) boyish yearnings and anxieties about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother had vanished.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had gone through a tragic experience which must forever solemnize
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life and deepen the significance of the acts by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) bound
himself to others.




<p/>CHAPTER LIV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The unwilling brain
Feigns often what it would not; and we trust
Imagination with such phantasies
As the tongue dares not fashion into words;
Which have no words, their horror makes them dim
To the mind's eye.''
 (<font color='red'><b>SHELLEY/Shelley</b></font>)</div>--SHELLEY.


<p/>Madonna Pia, whose husband, feeling himself injured by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pia</b></font>), took her (<font color='blue'><b>Pia</b></font>) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) castle amid the swampy flats of the Maremma and got rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pia</b></font>)
there, makes a pathetic figure in Dante's Purgatory, among the sinners
who repented at the last and desire to be remembered compassionately by
their fellow-countrymen. We know little about the grounds of mutual
discontent between the Siennese couple, but we may infer with some
confidence that the husband had never been a very delightful companion,
and that on the flats of the Maremma his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) disagreeable manners had a
background which threw them out remarkably; whence in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) desire to
punish his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife to the unmost, the nature of things was so far against
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that in relieving himself of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not avoid making the
relief mutual. And thus, without any hardness to the poor Tuscan lady,
who had her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) deliverance long ago, one may feel warranted in thinking of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with a less sympathetic interest than of the better known Gwendolen
who, instead of being delivered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) errors on earth and cleansed
from their effect in purgatory, is at the very height of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
entanglement in those fatal meshes which are woven within more closely
than without, and often make the inward torture disproportionate to
what is discernable as outward cause.

<p/>In taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wife with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) on a yachting expedition, Grandcourt had no
intention to get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wanted to feel more
securely that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) liked with, and to make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feel
it also. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was himself very fond of yachting: its dreamy
do-nothing absolutism, unmolested by social demands, suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
disposition, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did not in the least regard it as an equivalent for
the dreariness of the Maremma. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) reasons for carrying
Gwendolen out of reach, but they were not reasons that can seem black
in the mere statement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) suspected a growing spirit of opposition in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) feeling about the sentimental inclination she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) betrayed for
Deronda was what in another man he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would have called jealousy. In
himself it seemed merely a resolution to put an end to such foolery as
must have been going on in that prearranged visit of Deronda's which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
had divined and interrupted.

<p/>And Grandcourt might have pleaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was perfectly justified in
taking care that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wife should fulfill the obligations she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
accepted. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marriage was a contract where all the ostensible
advantages were on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side, and it was only of those advantages that
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband should use his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) power to hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from any injurious self
committal or unsuitable behavior. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew quite well that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not
married him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--had not overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) repugnance to certain facts--out of
love to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) personally; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had won her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by the rank and luxuries he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
to give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and these she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had got: he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had fulfilled his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) side of the
contract.

<p/>And Gwendolen, we know, was thoroughly aware of the situation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could not excuse herself by saying that there had been a tacit part of
the contract on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) side--namely, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meant to rule and have her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
own way. With all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) early indulgence in the disposition to dominate,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not one of the narrow-brained women who through life regard all
their own selfish demands as rights, and every claim upon themselves as
an injury. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a root of conscience in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and the process of
purgatory had begun for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) on the green earth: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
been wrong.

<p/>But now enter into the soul of this young creature as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found
herself, with the blue Mediterranean dividing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from the world, on
the tiny plank-island of a yacht, the domain of the husband to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had sold herself, and had been paid the strict
price--nay, paid more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had dared to ask in the handsome
maintenance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother:--the husband to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had sold her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
truthfulness and sense of justice, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) held them throttled into
silence, collared and dragged behind him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to witness what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would,
without remonstrance.

<p/>What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to complain of? The yacht was of the prettiest; the cabin
fitted up to perfection, smelling of cedar, soft-cushioned, hung with
silk, expanded with mirrors; the crew such as suited an elegant toy,
one of them having even ringlets, as well as a bronze complexion and
fine teeth; and Mr. Lush was not there, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) way back
to England as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lush</b></font>) had seen all and everything on board.
Moreover, Gwendolen herself liked the sea: it did not make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ill; and
to observe the rigging of the vessel and forecast the necessary
adjustments was a sort of amusement that might have gratified her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
activity and enjoyment of imaginary rule; the weather was fine, and
they were coasting southward, where even the rain-furrowed,
heat-cracked clay becomes gem-like with purple shadows, and where one
may float between blue and blue in an open-eyed dream that the world
has done with sorrow.

<p/>But what can still that hunger of the heart which sickens the eye for
beauty, and makes sweet-scented ease an oppression? What sort of Moslem
paradise would quiet the terrible fury of moral repulsion and cowed
resistance which, like an eating pain intensifying into torture,
concentrates the mind in that poisonous misery? While Gwendolen,
throned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cushions at evening, and beholding the glory of sea and
sky softening as if with boundless love around her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), was hoping that
Grandcourt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) march up and down was not going to pause near her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
not going to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) or speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), some woman, under a smoky
sky, obliged to consider the price of eggs in arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dinner, was
listening for the music of a footstep that would remove all risk from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) foretaste of joy; some couple, bending cheek by cheek, over a bit
of work done by the one and delighted in by the other, were reckoning
the earnings that would make them rich enough for a holiday among the
furze and heather.

<p/>Had Grandcourt the least conception of what was going on in the breast
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wife? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) conceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); but was that
necessary? She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was under his (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not accustomed to soothe
himself, as some cheerfully-disposed persons are, with the conviction
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was very generally and justly beloved. But what lay quite away
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) conception was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could have any special repulsion for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) personally. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) himself knew what personal repulsion
was--nobody better; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind was much furnished with a sense of what
brutes his (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fellow-creatures were, both masculine and feminine; what
odious familiarities they had, what smirks, what modes of flourishing
their handkerchiefs, what costume, what lavender water, what bulging
eyes, and what foolish notions of making themselves agreeable by
remarks which were not wanted. In this critical view of mankind there
was an affinity between him (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and Gwendolen before their marriage, and we
know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been attractingly wrought upon by the refined
negations he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) repulsion for
Lush. But how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to understand or conceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) present repulsion
for Henleigh Grandcourt? Some men bring themselves to believe, and not
merely maintain, the non-existence of an external world; a few others
believe themselves objects of repulsion to a woman without being told
so in plain language. But Grandcourt did not belong to this eccentric
body of thinkers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) life had reason to take a flattering
view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own attractiveness, and to place himself in fine antithesis
to the men who, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) saw at once, must be revolting to a woman of taste.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had no idea of moral repulsion, and could not have believed, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
had been told it, that there may be a resentment and disgust which will
gradually make beauty more detestable than ugliness, through
exasperation at that outward virtue in which hateful things can flaunt
themselves or find a supercilious advantage.

<p/>How, then, could Grandcourt divine what was going on in Gwendolen's
breast?

<p/>For their behavior to each other scandalized no observer--not even the
foreign maid, warranted against sea-sickness; nor Grandcourt's own
experienced valet: still less the picturesque crew, who regarded them
as a model couple in high life. Their companionship consisted chiefly
in a well-bred silence. Grandcourt had no humorous observations at
which Gwendolen could refuse to smile, no chit-chat to make small
occasions of dispute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was perfectly polite in arranging an
additional garment over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) when needful, and in handing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) any object
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to need, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not fall into the
vulgarity of accepting or rejecting such politeness rudely.

<p/>Grandcourt put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) telescope and said, <div class="bookquote">``There's a plantation of
sugar-canes at the foot of that rock; should you like to look?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>remembering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) must try and
interest herself in sugar-canes as something outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) personal
affairs. Then Grandcourt would walk up and down and smoke for a long
while, pausing occasionally to point out a sail on the horizon, and at
last would seat himself and look at Gwendolen with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) narrow immovable
gaze, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were part of the complete yacht; while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), conscious
of being looked at was exerting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ingenuity not to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) eyes. At
dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would remark that the fruit was getting stale, and they must
put in somewhere for more; or, observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not drink the
wine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would like any other kind better. A lady was
obliged to respond to these things suitably; and even if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not
shrunk from quarrelling on other grounds, quarreling with Grandcourt
was impossible; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might as well have made angry remarks to a
dangerous serpent ornamentally coiled in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cabin without invitation.
And what sort of dispute could a woman of any pride and dignity begin
on a yacht?

<p/>Grandcourt had intense satisfaction in leading his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wife captive after
this fashion; it gave their life on a small scale a royal
representation and publicity in which every thing familiar was got rid
of, and every body must do what was expected of them whatever might be
their private protest--the protest -LRB-kept strictly private-RRB- adding to
the piquancy of despotism.

<p/>To Gwendolen, who even in the freedom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) maiden time, had had very
faint glimpses of any heroism or sublimity, the medium that now thrust
itself everywhere before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) view was this husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) relation to
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). The beings closest to us, whether in love or hate, are often
virtually our interpreters of the world, and some feather-headed
gentleman or lady whom in passing we regret to take as legal tender for
a human being, may be acting as a melancholy theory of life in the
minds of those who live with them--like a piece of yellow and wavy
glass that distorts form and makes color an affliction. Their trivial
sentences, their petty standards, their low suspicions, their loveless
_ennui_, may be making somebody else's life no better than a promenade
through a pantheon of ugly idols. Gwendolen had that kind of window
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), affecting the distant equally with the near. Some unhappy
wives are soothed by the possibility that they may become mothers; but
Gwendolen felt that to desire a child for herself would have been a
consenting to the completion of the injury she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been guilty of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
was reduced to dread lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should become a mother. It was not the
image of a new sweetly-budding life that came as a vision of
deliverance from the monotony of distaste: it was an image of another
sort. In the irritable, fluctuating stages of despair, gleams of hope
came in the form of some possible accident. To dwell on the benignity
of accident was a refuge from worse temptation.

<p/>The embitterment of hatred is often as unaccountable to onlookers as
the growth of devoted love, and it not only seems but is really out of
direct relation with any outward causes to be alleged. Passion is of
the nature of seed, and finds nourishment within, tending to a
predominance which determines all currents toward itself, and makes the
whole life its tributary. And the intensest form of hatred is that
rooted in fear, which compels to silence and drives vehemence into a
constructive vindictiveness, an imaginary annihilation of the detested
object, something like the hidden rites of vengeance with which the
persecuted have made a dark vent for their rage, and soothed their
suffering into dumbness. Such hidden rites went on in the secrecy of
Gwendolen's mind, but not with soothing effect--rather with the effect
of a struggling terror. Side by side with the dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband had
grown the self-dread, which urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to flee from the pursuing images
wrought by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pent-up impulse. The vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) past wrong-doing, and
what it had brought on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), came with a pale ghastly illumination over
every imagined deed that was a rash effort at freedom, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
made in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) marriage. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had learned to see all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) acts
through the impression they would make on Deronda: whatever relief
might come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not sever it from the judgment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that
would be created in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind. Not one word of flattery, of indulgence,
of dependence on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) favor, could be fastened on by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in all their
intercourse, to weaken his (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) restraining power over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) -LRB-in this way
Deronda's effort over himself was repaid-RRB-; and amid the dreary
uncertainties of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoiled life the possible remedies that lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
mind, nay, the remedy that lay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feeling for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) only
hope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) a terrible-browed angel, from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not
think of concealing any deed so as to win an ignorant regard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>):
it belonged to the nature of their relation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should be
truthful, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) power over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had begun in the raising of a
self-discontent which could be satisfied only by genuine change. But in
no concealment had she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) now any confidence: her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) vision of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
to dread took more decidedly than ever the form of some fiercely
impulsive deed, committed as in a dream that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would instantaneously
wake from to find the effects real though the images had been false: to
find death under her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands, but instead of darkness, daylight; instead
of satisfied hatred, the dismay of guilt; instead of freedom, the palsy
of a new terror--a white dead face from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was forever trying to
flee and forever held back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) remembered Deronda's words: they were
continually recurring in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn your fear into a safeguard. Keep your dread fixed on the idea of
increasing your remorse. * * * Take your fear as a safeguard. It is
like quickness of hearing. It may make consequences passionately
present to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>And so it was. In Gwendolen's consciousness temptation and dread met
and stared like two pale phantoms, each seeing itself in the
other--each obstructed by its own image; and all the while her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fuller
self beheld the apparitions and sobbed for deliverance from them.

<p/>Inarticulate prayers, no more definite than a cry, often swept out from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) into the vast silence, unbroken except by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's breathing
or the plash of the wave or the creaking of the masts; but if ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
thought of definite help, it took the form of Deronda's presence and
words, of the sympathy he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might have for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), of the direction he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). It was sometimes after a white-lipped fierce-eyed temptation
with murdering fingers had made its demon-visit that these best moments
of inward crying and clinging for rescue would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
would lie with wide-open eyes in which the rising tears seemed a
blessing, and the thought, <div class="bookquote">``I will not mind if I can keep from getting
wicked,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>seemed an answer to the indefinite prayer.

<p/>So the days passed, taking with them light breezes beyond and about the
Balearic Isles, and then to Sardinia, and then with gentle change
persuading them northward again toward Corsica. But this floating,
gentle-wafted existence, with its apparently peaceful influences, was
becoming as bad as a nightmare to Gwendolen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long are we to be yachting?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ventured to ask one day after
they had been touching at Ajaccio, and the mere fact of change in going
ashore had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) a relief from some of the thoughts which seemed
now to cling about the very rigging of the vessel, mix with the air in
the red silk cabin below, and make the smell of the sea odious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What else should we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not tired of it. I
don't see why we shouldn't stay out any length of time. There's less to
bore one in this way. And where would you go to? I'm sick of foreign
places. And we shall have enough of Ryelands. Would you rather be at
Ryelands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, indifferently, finding all places alike
undescribable as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagined herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband in them.
<div class="bookquote">``I only wondered how long you would like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like yachting longer than anything else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt; <div class="bookquote">``and I
had none last year. I suppose you are beginning to tire of it. Women
are so confoundedly whimsical. They expect everything to give way to
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, letting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) scorn in a flute-like
tone. <div class="bookquote">``I never expect you to give way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) inward voice, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
and then choosing an orange--for they were at table.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind to a length of yatching that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not see
beyond; but the next day, after a squall which had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rather ill
for the first time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) came down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's been the devil's own work in the night. The skipper says we
shall have to stay at Genoa for a week while things are set right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mind that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, who lay looking very white amidst
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) white drapery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think so. Who wants to be broiling at Genoa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a change,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, made a little incautious by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
languor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ don't want any change. Besides, the place is intolerable; and one
can't move along the roads. I shall go out in a boat, as I used to do,
and manage it myself. One can get a few hours every day in that way
instead of striving in a damnable hotel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Here was a prospect which held hope in it. Gwendolen thought of hours
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would be alone, since Grandcourt would not want to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in
the said boat, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) exultation at this unlooked-for relief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had wild, contradictory fancies of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
freedom--that <div class="bookquote">``running away''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had already innumerable times
seen to be a worse evil than any actual endurance, now finding new
arguments as an escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) worse self. Also, visionary relief on a
par with the fancy of a prisoner that the night wind may blow down the
wall of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) prison and save him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) from desperate devices, insinuated
itself as a better alternative, lawful to wish for.

<p/>The fresh current of expectation revived her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) energies, and enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
to take all things with an air of cheerfulness and alacrity that made a
change marked enough to be noticed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) watched through
the evening lights to the sinking of the moon with less of awed
loneliness than was habitual to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--nay, with a vague impression that
in this mighty frame of things there might be some preparation of
rescue for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Why not?--since the weather had just been on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) side.
This possibility of hoping, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) long fluctuation amid fears, was
like a first return of hunger to the long-languishing patient.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was waked the next morning by the casting of the anchor in the port
of Genoa--waked from a strangely-mixed dream in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt herself
escaping over the Mont Cenis, and wondering to find it warmer even in
the moonlight on the snow, till suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) met Deronda, who told her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
to go back.

<p/>In an hour or so from that dream she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) actually met Deronda. But it was
on the palatial staircase of the _Italia_, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was feeling warm
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) light woolen dress and straw hat; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
side.

<p/>There was a start of surprise in Deronda before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hat
and pass on. The moment did not seem to favor any closer greeting, and
the circumstances under which they had last parted made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) doubtful
whether Grandcourt would be civilly inclined to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).

<p/>The doubt might certainly have been changed into a disagreeable
certainty, for Grandcourt on this unaccountable appearance of Deronda
at Genoa of all places, immediately tried to conceive how there could
have been an arrangement between him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and Gwendolen. It is true that
before they were well in their rooms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had seen how difficult it was
to shape such an arrangement with any probability, being too
cool-headed to find it at once easily credible that Gwendolen had not
only while in London hastened to inform Deronda of the yachting
project, but had posted a letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) from Marseilles or Barcelona,
advising him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to travel to Genoa in time for the chance of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
there, or of receiving a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) telling of some other
destination--all which must have implied a miraculous foreknowledge in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and in Deronda a bird-like facility in flying about and perching
idly. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was there, and though Grandcourt would not make a fool
of himself by fabrications that others might call preposterous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was
not, for all that, disposed to admit fully that Deronda's presence was,
so far as Gwendolen was concerned, a mere accident. It was a disgusting
fact; that was enough; and no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was well pleased. A man out of
temper does not wait for proofs before feeling toward all things
animate and inanimate as if they were in a conspiracy against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but
at once threshes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse or kicks his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dog in consequence. Grandcourt
felt toward Gwendolen and Deronda as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) knew them to be in a
conspiracy against him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and here was an event in league with them. What
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) took for clearly certain--and so far he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) divined the truth--was that
Gwendolen was now counting on an interview with Deronda whenever her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
husband's back was turned.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sat taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) coffee at a convenient angle for observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
discerned something which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt sure was the effect of a secret
delight--some fresh ease in moving and speaking, some peculiar meaning
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked on. Certainly her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) troubles had not
marred her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) beauty. Mrs. Grandcourt was handsomer than Gwendolen
Harleth: her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) grace and expression were informed by a greater variety of
inward experience, giving new play to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) features, new attitudes in
movement and repose; her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) whole person and air had the nameless
something which often makes a woman more interesting after marriage
than before, less confident that all things are according to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
opinion, and yet with less of deer-like shyness--more fully a human
being.

<p/>This morning the benefits of the voyage seemed to be suddenly revealing
themselves in a new elasticity of mien. As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rose from the table and
put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) two heavily-jewelled hands on each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck, according
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wont, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no art to conceal that sort of joyous expectation
which makes the present more bearable than usual, just as when a man
means to go out he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finds it easier to be amiable to the family for a
quarter of an hour beforehand. It is not impossible that a terrier
whose pleasure was concerned would perceive those amiable signs and
know their meaning--know why his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) master stood in a peculiar way, talked
with alacrity, and even had a peculiar gleam in his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) eye, so that on the
least movement toward the door, the terrier would scuttle to be in
time. And, in dog fashion, Grandcourt discerned the signs of
Gwendolen's expectation, interpreting them with the narrow correctness
which leaves a world of unknown feeling behind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A--just ring, please, and tell Gibbs to order some dinner for us at
three,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) too rose, took out a cigar, and then
stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hand toward the hat that lay near. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to send
Angus to find a little sailing-boat for us to go out in; one that I can
manage, with you at the tiller. It's uncommonly pleasant these fine
evenings--the least boring of anything we can do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen turned cold. There was not only the cruel disappointment;
there was the immediate conviction that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband had determined to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sight; and probably
this dual solitude in a boat was the more attractive to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) because it
would be wearisome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). They were not on the plank-island; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt
it the more possible to begin a contest. But the gleaming content had
died out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). There was a change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) like that of a glacier after
sunset.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather not go in the boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Take some one else with
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; if you don't go, I shall not go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt. <div class="bookquote">``We
shall stay suffocating here, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear to go in a boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a sudden change,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, with a slight sneer. <div class="bookquote">``But,
since you decline, we shall stay indoors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hat again, lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cigar, and walked up and down the
room, pausing now and then to look out of the windows. Gwendolen's
temper told her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to persist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew very well now that Grandcourt
would not go without her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) must tyrannize over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should
not do it precisely in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would choose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to
stay in the hotel. Without speaking again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) passed into the
adjoining bedroom and threw herself into a chair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) anger, seeing
no purpose or issue--only feeling that the wave of evil had rushed back
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) momentary breathing-place.

<p/>Presently Grandcourt came in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hat on, but threw it off and sat
down sideways on a chair nearly in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), saying, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
superficial drawl--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you come round yet? or do you find it agreeable to be out of
temper. You make things uncommonly pleasant for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you want to make them unpleasant for _me_?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
getting helpless again, and feeling the hot tears rise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, will you be good enough to say what it is you have to complain
of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, and using his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) most inward
voice. <div class="bookquote">``Is it that I stay indoors when you stay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could give no answer. The sort of truth that made any excuse for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) anger could not be uttered. In the conflict of despair and
humiliation she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began to sob, and the tears rolled down her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cheeks--a
form of agitation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never shown before in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's
presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope this is useful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, after a moment or two. <div class="bookquote">``All I
can say is, it's most confoundedly unpleasant. What the devil women can
see in this kind of thing, I don't know. _You_ see something to be got
by it, of course. All I can see is, that we shall be shut up here when
we might have been having a pleasant sail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, impetuously. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps we shall be
drowned.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began to sob again.

<p/>This extraordinary behavior, which had evidently some relation to
Deronda, gave more definiteness to Grandcourt's conclusions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) drew
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) chair quite close in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and said, in a low tone, <div class="bookquote">``Just
be quiet and listen, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>There seemed to be a magical effect in this close vicinity. Gwendolen
shrank and ceased to sob. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyelids down and clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
hands tightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us understand each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, in the same tone. <div class="bookquote">``I
know very well what this nonsense means. But if you suppose I am going
to let you make a fool of me, just dismiss that notion from your mind.
What are you looking forward to, if you can't behave properly as my
wife? There is disgrace for you, if you like to have it, but I don't
know anything else; and as to Deronda, it's quite clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hangs
back from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all false!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``You don't in the least
imagine what is in my mind. I have seen enough of the disgrace that
comes in that way. And you had better leave me at liberty to speak with
any one I like. It will be better for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will allow me to judge of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, rising and
moving to a little distance toward the window, but standing there
playing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) whiskers as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) were awaiting something.

<p/>Gwendolen's words had so clear and tremendous a meaning for herself
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought they must have expressed it to Grandcourt, and had no
sooner uttered them than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dreaded their effect. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) soul was
garrisoned against presentiments and fears: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had the courage and
confidence that belong to domination, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was at that moment feeling
perfectly satisfied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wife with bit and bridle. By the
time they had been married a year she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would cease to be restive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
continued standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) air of indifference, till she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
habitual stifling consciousness of having an immovable obstruction in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life, like the nightmare of beholding a single form that serves to
arrest all passage though the wide country lies open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What decision have you come to?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) said, presently looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What orders shall I give?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, let us go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. The walls had begun to be an
imprisonment, and while there was breath in this man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have the
mastery over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words had the power of thumb-screws and the cold
touch of the rock. To resist was to act like a stupid animal unable to
measure results.

<p/>So the boat was ordered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) even went down to the quay again with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
to see it before midday. Grandcourt had recovered perfect quietude of
temper, and had a scornful satisfaction in the attention given by the
nautical groups to the _milord_, owner of the handsome yacht which had
just put in for repairs, and who being an Englishman was naturally so
at home on the sea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) could manage a sail with the same ease that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) could manage a horse. The sort of exultation he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had discerned in
Gwendolen this morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) now thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) discerned in him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>); and
it was true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) mind on this boating, and carried out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) purpose as something that people might not expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) to do, with
the gratified impulse of a strong will which had nothing better to
exert itself upon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had remarkable physical courage, and was proud of
it--or rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had a great contempt for the coarser, bulkier men who
generally had less. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) was ruling that Gwendolen should go
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>).

<p/>And when they came down again at five o'clock, equipped for their
boating, the scene was as good as a theatrical representation for all
beholders. This handsome, fair-skinned English couple, manifesting the
usual eccentricity of their nation, both of them proud, pale, and calm,
without a smile on their faces, moving like creatures who were
fulfilling a supernatural destiny--it was a thing to go out and see, a
thing to paint. The husband's chest, back, and arms, showed very well
in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) close-fitting dress, and the wife was declared to be a statue.

<p/>Some suggestions were proffered concerning a possible change in the
breeze, and the necessary care in putting about, but Grandcourt's
manner made the speakers understand that they were too officious, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knew better than they.

<p/>Gwendolen, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) impassable air, as they moved away from the
strand, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination obstinately at work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not afraid of
any outward dangers--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own wishes which were taking
shapes possible and impossible, like a cloud of demon-faces. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own hatred, which under the cold iron touch that had
compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to-day had gathered a fierce intensity. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sat
guiding the tiller under her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's eyes, doing just what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), the strife within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seemed like her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own effort to escape from
herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) clung to the thought of Deronda: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) persuaded herself
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would not go away while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was there--he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) needed
help. The sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was there would save her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from acting out the
evil within. And yet quick, quick, came images, plans of evil that
would come again and seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in the night, like furies preparing the
deed that they would straightway avenge.

<p/>They were taken out of the port and carried eastward by a gentle
breeze. Some clouds tempered the sunlight, and the hour was always
deepening toward the supreme beauty of evening. Sails larger and
smaller changed their aspect like sensitive things, and made a cheerful
companionship, alternately near and far. The grand city shone more
vaguely, the mountains looked out above it, and there was stillness as
in an island sanctuary. Yet suddenly Gwendolen let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands fall, and
said in a scarcely audible tone, <div class="bookquote">``God help me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt, not distinguishing the words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, rousing herself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) momentary
forgetfulness and resuming the ropes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you find this pleasant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Grandcourt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You admit now we couldn't have done anything better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I see nothing better. I think we shall go on always, like the
Flying Dutchman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen wildly.

<p/>Grandcourt gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) narrow examining glances, and then said,
<div class="bookquote">``If you like, we can go to Spezia in the morning, and let them take us
up there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandcourt/Mr. Grandcourt/Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I shall like nothing better than this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well: we'll do the same to-morrow. But we must be turning in
soon. I shall put about.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ritorna a tua scienza

 (<font color='red'><b>Dante/DANTE</b></font>)</div>--DANTE.


<p/>When Deronda met Gwendolen and Grandcourt on the staircase, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mind
was seriously preoccupied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had just been summoned to the second
interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mother.

<p/>In two hours after his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) parting from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) knew that the Princess
Halm-Eberstein had left the hotel, and so far as the purpose of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
journey to Genoa was concerned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) might himself have set off on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
way to Mainz, to deliver the letter from Joseph Kalonymos, and get
possession of the family chest. But mixed mental conditions, which did
not resolve themselves into definite reasons, hindered him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) from
departure. Long after the farewell he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) was kept passive by a weight of
retrospective feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) lived again, with the new keenness of emotive
memory, through the exciting scenes which seemed past only in the sense
of preparation for their actual presence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) allowed
himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) solitude to sob, with perhaps more than a woman's
acuteness of compassion, over that woman's life so near to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>), and yet
so remote. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) beheld the world changed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) by the certitude of ties
that altered the poise of hopes and fears, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) a new sense of
fellowship, as if under cover of the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) had joined the wrong band
of wanderers, and found with the rise of morning that the tents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>)
kindred were grouped far off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) had a quivering imaginative sense of
close relation to the grandfather who had been animated by strong
impulses and beloved thoughts, which were now perhaps being roused from
their slumber within himself. And through all this passionate
meditation Mordecai and Mirah were always present, as beings who
clasped hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) in sympathetic silence.

<p/>Of such quick, responsive fibre was Deronda made, under that mantle of
self-controlled reserve into which early experience had thrown so much
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) young strength.

<p/>When the persistent ringing of a bell as a signal reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) of the
hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought of looking into _Bradshaw_, and making the brief
necessary preparations for starting by the next train--thought of it,
but made no movement in consequence. Wishes went to Mainz and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
was to get possession of there--to London and the beings there who made
the strongest attachments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life; but there were other wishes that
clung in these moments to Genoa, and they kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was by that
force which urges us to linger over an interview that carries a
presentiment of final farewell or of overshadowing sorrow. Deronda did
not formally say, <div class="bookquote">``I will stay over to-night, because it is Friday, and
I should like to go to the evening service at the synagogue where they
must all have gone; and besides, I may see the Grandcourts again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>But
simply, instead of packing and ringing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) bill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sat doing
nothing at all, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind went to the synagogue and saw faces
there probably little different from those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) grandfather's time,
and heard the Spanish-Hebrew liturgy which had lasted through the
seasons of wandering generations like a plant with wandering seed, that
gives the far-off lands a kinship to the exile's home--while, also, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
mind went toward Gwendolen, with anxious remembrance of what had been,
and with a half-admitted impression that it would be hardness in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
willingly to go away at once without making some effort, in spite of
Grandcourt's probable dislike, to manifest the continuance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
sympathy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) since their abrupt parting.

<p/>In this state of mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) deferred departure, ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) dinner without
sense of flavor, rose from it quickly to find the synagogue, and in
passing the porter asked if Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt were still in the
hotel, and what was the number of their apartment. The porter gave him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)
the number, but added that they were gone out boating. That information
had somehow power enough over Deronda to divide his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thoughts with the
memories wakened among the sparse _talithim_ and keen dark faces of
worshippers whose way of taking awful prayers and invocations with the
easy familiarity which might be called Hebrew dyed Italian, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
reflect that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) grandfather, according to the Princess's hints of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
character, must have been almost as exceptional a Jew as Mordecai. But
were not men of ardent zeal and far-reaching hope everywhere
exceptional? the men who had the visions which, as Mordecai said, were
the creators and feeders of the world--moulding and feeding the more
passive life which without them would dwindle and shrivel into the
narrow tenacity of insects, unshaken by thoughts beyond the reach of
their antennae. Something of a mournful impatience perhaps added itself
to the solicitude about Gwendolen -LRB-a solicitude that had room to grow
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) present release from immediate cares-RRB- as an incitement to hasten
from the synagogue and choose to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) evening walk toward the quay,
always a favorite haunt with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), and just now attractive with the
possibility that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) might be in time to see the Grandcourts come in
from their boating. In this case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) would advance to
greet them deliberately, and ignore any grounds that the husband might
have for wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) elsewhere.

<p/>The sun had set behind a bank of cloud, and only a faint yellow light
was giving its farewell kisses to the waves, which were agitated by an
active breeze. Deronda, sauntering slowly within sight of what took
place on the strand, observed the groups there concentrating their
attention on a sailing-boat which was advancing swiftly landward, being
rowed by two men. Amidst the clamorous talk in various languages,
Deronda held it the surer means of getting information not to ask
questions, but to elbow his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) way to the foreground and be an
unobstructed witness of what was occurring. Telescopes were being used,
and loud statements made that the boat held somebody who had been
drowned. One said it was the _milord_ who had gone out in a sailing
boat; another maintained that the prostrate figure he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) discerned was
_miladi_; a Frenchman who had no glass would rather say that it was
_milord_ who had probably taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wife out to drown her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), according to
the national practice--a remark which an English skipper immediately
commented on in our native idiom -LRB-as nonsense which--had undergone a
mining operation-RRB-, and further dismissed by the decision that the
reclining figure was a woman. For Deronda, terribly excited by
fluctuating fears, the strokes of the oars as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) watched them were
divided by swift visions of events, possible and impossible, which
might have brought about this issue, or this broken-off fragment of an
issue, with a worse half undisclosed--if this woman apparently snatched
from the waters were really Mrs. Grandcourt.

<p/>But soon there was no longer any doubt: the boat was being pulled to
land, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw Gwendolen half raising herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
own effort, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heavy covering of tarpaulin and pea-jackets--pale
as one of the sheeted dead, shivering, with wet hair streaming, a wild
amazed consciousness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had waked up in a world
where some judgment was impending, and the beings she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw around were
coming to seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). The first rower who jumped to land was also wet
through, and ran off; the sailors, close about the boat, hindered
Deronda from advancing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could only look on while Gwendolen gave
scared glances, and seemed to shrink with terror as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was carefully,
tenderly helped out, and led on by the strong arms of those rough,
bronzed men, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wet clothes clinging about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) limbs, and adding to
the impediment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) weakness. Suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wandering eyes fell on
Deronda, standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and immediately, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been
expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tried to stretch out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arms,
which were held back by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) supporters, saying, in a muffled voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is come, it is come! He (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) is dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>supporters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, in a tone of authority; <div class="bookquote">``quiet yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Then to the men who were assisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am a connection of this
lady's husband. If you will get her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on to the _Italia_ as quickly as
possible, I will undertake everything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) stayed behind to hear from the remaining boatman that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband
had gone down irrecoverably, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) boat was left floating empty.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) comrade had heard a cry, had come up in time to see the lady
jump in after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, and had got her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) out fast enough to save her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
from much damage.

<p/>After this, Deronda hastened to the hotel to assure himself that the
best medical help would be provided; and being satisfied on this point,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) telegraphed the event to Sir Hugo, begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) to come forthwith,
and also to Mr. Gascoigne, whose address at the rectory made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)
nearest known way of getting the information to Gwendolen's mother.
Certain words of Gwendolen's in the past had come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) with the
effectiveness of an inspiration: in moments of agitated confession she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's presence, as a possible help, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could
have had it.




<p/>CHAPTER LVI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The pang, the curse with which they died,
Had never passed away:
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,
Nor lift them up to pray.''
 (<font color='red'><b>COLERIDGE</b></font>)</div>--COLERIDGE.


<p/>Deronda did not take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) clothes that night. Gwendolen, after
insisting on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) again before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would consent to be undressed,
had been perfectly quiet, and had only asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), with a whispering,
repressed eagerness, to promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sent
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in the morning. Still, the possibility that a change might come
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), the danger of a supervening feverish condition, and the
suspicion that something in the late catastrophe was having an effect
which might betray itself in excited words, acted as a foreboding
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) attendant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should keep himself
ready to be called if there were any alarming change of symptoms,
making it understood by all concerned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was in communication with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) friends in England, and felt bound meanwhile to take all care on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) behalf--a position which it was the easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to assume,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was well known to Grandcourt's valet, the only old servant
who had come on the late voyage.

<p/>But when fatigue from the strangely various emotion of the day at last
sent Deronda to sleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) remained undisturbed except by the morning
dreams, which came as a tangled web of yesterday's events, and finally
waked him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), with an image drawn by his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) pressing anxiety.

<p/>Still, it was morning, and there had been no summons--an augury which
cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) toilet, and reflected that it was too
early to send inquiries. Later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) learned that she (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had passed a too
wakeful night, but had shown no violent signs of agitation, and was at
last sleeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wondered at the force that dwelt in this creature, so
alive to dread; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had an irresistible impression that even under
the effects of a severe physical shock she (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was mastering herself with a
determination of concealment. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own part, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
sensibilities had been blunted by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been going through in the
meeting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mother: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) seemed to himself now to be only fulfilling
claims, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) more passionate sympathy was in abeyance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had lately
been living so keenly in an experience quite apart from Gwendolen's
lot, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) present cares for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were like a revisiting of scenes
familiar in the past, and there was not yet a complete revival of the
inward response to them.

<p/>Meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) employed himself in getting a formal, legally recognized
statement from the fisherman who had rescued Gwendolen. Few details
came to light. The boat in which Grandcourt had gone out had been found
drifting with its sail loose, and had been towed in. The fishermen
thought it likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had been knocked overboard by the flapping of
the sail while putting about, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had not known how to swim;
but, though they were near, their attention had been first arrested by
a cry which seemed like that of a man in distress, and while they were
hastening with their oars, they heard a shriek from the lady, and saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) jump in.

<p/>On re-entering the hotel, Deronda was told that Gwendolen had risen,
and was desiring to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was shown into a room darkened by
blinds and curtains, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was seated with a white shawl wrapped
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), looking toward the opening door like one waiting uneasily.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) long hair was gathered up and coiled carefully, and, through
all, the blue stars in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ears had kept their place: as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) started
impulsively to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) full height, sheathed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) white shawl, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face
and neck not less white, except for a purple line under her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
lips a little apart with the peculiar expression of one accused and
helpless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked like the unhappy ghost of that Gwendolen Harleth
whom Deronda had seen turning with firm lips and proud self-possession
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) losses at the gaming table. The sight pierced him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with pity,
and the effects of all their past relations began to revive within him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beseech you to rest--not to stand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) approached
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) obeyed, falling back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chair again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you sit down near me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to speak very low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was in a large arm-chair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) drew a small one near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) side.
The action seemed to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) peculiarly: turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pale face full
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), which was very near, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, in the lowest audible tone,
<div class="bookquote">``You know I am a guilty woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda himself turned paler as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) did not
dare to say more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is dead.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uttered this with the same undertoned decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, in a mournful suspense which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) reluctant to
speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face will not be seen above the water again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a
tone that was not louder, but of a suppressed eagerness, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) held
both her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands clenched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not by any one else--only by me--a dead face--I shall never get away
from it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was with an inward voice of desperate self-repression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoke
these last words, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked away from Deronda toward something
at a distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) on the floor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was seeing the whole
event--her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own acts included--through an exaggerating medium of
excitement and horror? Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in a state of delirium into which there
entered a sense of concealment and necessity for self-repression? Such
thoughts glanced through Deronda as a sort of hope. But imagine the
conflict of feeling that kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was bent on confession,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) dreaded hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) confession. Against his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) better will he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
shrank from the task that was laid on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wished, and yet rebuked
the wish as cowardly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could bury her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) secrets in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own bosom.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not a priest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) dreaded the weight of this woman's soul flung
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own with imploring dependence. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke again, hurriedly,
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not say that I ought to tell the world? you will not say that
I ought to be disgraced? I could not do it. I could not bear it. I
cannot have my mother know. Not if I were dead. I could not have her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
know. I must tell you; but you will not say that any one else should
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can say nothing in my ignorance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, mournfully, <div class="bookquote">``except
that I desire to help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you from the beginning--as soon as I could--I told you I was
afraid of myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>There was a piteous pleading in the low murmur in
which Deronda turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ear only. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face afflicted him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) too much. <div class="bookquote">``I
felt a hatred in me that was always working like an evil
spirit--contriving things. Everything I could do to free myself came
into my mind; and it got worse--all things got worse. That is why I
asked you to come to me in town. I thought then I would tell you the
worst about myself. I tried. But I could not tell everything. And _he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_
came in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) paused, while a shudder passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but soon went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you everything now. Do you think a woman who cried, and
prayed, and struggled to be saved from herself, could be a murderess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, in a deep, shaken voice, <div class="bookquote">``don't torture me
needlessly. You have not murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). You threw yourself into the
water with the impulse to save him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Tell me the rest afterward. This
death was an accident that you could not have hindered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be impatient with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>The tremor, the childlike beseeching in
these words compelled Deronda to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) head and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.
The poor quivering lips went on. <div class="bookquote">``You said--you used to say--you felt
more for those who had done something wicked and were miserable; you
said they might get better--they might be scourged into something
better. If you had not spoken in that way, Everything would have been
worse. I _did_ remember all you said to me. It came to me always. It
came to me at the very last--that was the reason why I--But now, if you
cannot bear with me when I tell you everything--if you turn away from
me and forsake me, what shall I do? Am I worse than I was when you
found me and wanted to make me better? All the wrong I have done was in
me then--and more--and more--if you had not come and been patient with
me. And now--will you forsake me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, which had been so tightly clenched some minutes before, were
now helplessly relaxed and trembling on the arm of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chair. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
quivering lips remained parted as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ceased speaking. Deronda could
not answer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was obliged to look away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) took one of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, and
clasped it as if they were going to walk together like two children: it
was the only way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could answer, <div class="bookquote">``I will not forsake you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) were putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) name to a blank
paper which might be filled up terribly. Their attitude, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) adverted
face with its expression of a suffering which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was solemnly resolved
to undergo, might have told half the truth of the situation to a
beholder who had suddenly entered.

<p/>That grasp was an entirely new experience to Gwendolen: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had never
before had from any man a sign of tenderness which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own being had
needed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) interpreted its powerful effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) into a promise
of inexhaustible patience and constancy. The stream of renewed strength
made it possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to go on as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had begun--with that fitful,
wandering confession where the sameness of experience seems to nullify
the sense of time or of order in events. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began again in a
fragmentary way--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All sorts of contrivances in my mind--but all so difficult. And I
fought against them--I was terrified at them--I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) dead
face'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--here her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) voice sank almost to a whisper close to Deronda's
ear--<div class="bookquote">``ever so long ago I saw it and I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) to be dead. And yet it
terrified me. I was like two creatures. I could not speak--I wanted to
kill--it was as strong as thirst--and then directly--I felt beforehand
I had done something dreadful, unalterable--that would make me like an
evil spirit. And it came--it came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was silent a moment or two, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) memory had lost itself in a
web where each mesh drew all the rest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It had all been in my mind when I first spoke to you--when we were at
the Abbey. I had done something then. I could not tell you that. It was
the only thing I did toward carrying out my thoughts. They went about
over everything; but they all remained like dreadful dreams--all but
one. I did one act--and I never undid it--it is there still--as long
ago as when we were at Ryelands. There it was--something my fingers
longed for among the beautiful toys in the cabinet in my boudoir--small
and sharp like a long willow leaf in a silver sheath. I locked it in
the drawer of my dressing-case. I was continually haunted with it and
how I should use it. I fancied myself putting it under my pillow. But I
never did. I never looked at it again. I dared not unlock the drawer:
it had a key all to itself; and not long ago, when we were in the
yacht, I dropped the key into the deep water. It was my wish to drop it
and deliver myself. After that I began to think how I could open the
drawer without the key: and when I found we were to stay at Genoa, it
came into my mind that I could get it opened privately at the hotel.
But then, when we were going up the stairs, I met you; and I thought I
should talk to you alone and tell you this--everything I could not tell
you in town; and then I was forced to go out in the boat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A sob had for the first time risen with the last words, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sank
back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chair. The memory of that acute disappointment seemed for
the moment to efface what had come since. Deronda did not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, insistently--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it has all remained in your imagination. It has gone on only in
your thought. To the last the evil temptation has been resisted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence. The tears had rolled down her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cheeks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) handkerchief against them and sat upright. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was summoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
resolution; and again, leaning a little toward Deronda's ear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began
in a whisper--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; I will tell you everything as God knows it. I will tell you no
falsehood; I will tell you the exact truth. What should I do else? I
used to think I could never be wicked. I thought of wicked people as if
they were a long way off me. Since then I have been wicked. I have felt
wicked. And everything has been a punishment to me--all the things I
used to wish for--it is as if they had been made red-hot. The very
daylight has often been a punishment to me. Because--you know--I ought
not to have married. That was the beginning of it. I wronged some one
else. I broke my promise. I meant to get pleasure for myself, and it
all turned to misery. I wanted to make my gain out of another's
loss--you remember?--it was like roulette--and the money burned into
me. And I could not complain. It was as if I had prayed that another
should lose and I should win. And I had won, I knew it all--I knew I
was guilty. When we were on the sea, and I lay awake at night in the
cabin, I sometimes felt that everything I had done lay open without
excuse--nothing was hidden--how could anything be known to me only?--it
was not my own knowledge, it was God's that had entered into me, and
even the stillness--everything held a punishment for me--everything but
you. I always thought that you would not want me to be punished--you
would have tried and helped me to be better. And only thinking of that
helped me. You will not change--you will not want to punish me now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again a sob had risen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God forbid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>groaned Deronda. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sat motionless.

<p/>This long wandering with the conscious-stricken one over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) past was
difficult to bear, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) dared not again urge her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with a question. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
must let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind follow its own need. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) unconsciously left intervals
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) retrospect, not clearly distinguishing between what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said and
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had only an inward vision of. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) next words came after such
an interval.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That all made it so hard when I was forced to go in the boat. Because
when I saw you it was an unexpected joy, and I thought I could tell you
everything--about the locked-up drawer and what I had not told you
before. And if I had told you, and knew it was in your mind, it would
have less power over me. I hoped and trusted in that. For after all my
struggles and my crying, the hatred and rage, the temptation that
frightened me, the longing, the thirst for what I dreaded, always came
back. And that disappointment--when I was quite shut out from speaking
to you, and was driven to go in the boat--brought all the evil back, as
if I had been locked in a prison with it and no escape. Oh, it seems so
long ago now since I stepped into that boat! I could have given up
everything in that moment, to have the forked lightning for a weapon to
strike him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Some of the compressed fierceness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was recalling seemed to find
its way into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) undertoned utterance. After a little silence she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said,
with agitated hurry--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) were here again, what should I do? I cannot wish him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) here--and
yet I cannot bear his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) dead face. I was a coward. I ought to have borne
contempt. I ought to have gone away--gone and wandered like a beggar
rather than to stay to feel like a fiend. But turn where I would there
was something I could not bear. Sometimes I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) would kill _me_
if I resisted his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) will. But now--his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) dead face is there, and I cannot
bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly loosing Deronda's hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) started up, stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arms to
their full length upward, and said with a sort of moan--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been a cruel woman! What can _I_ do but cry for help? _I_ am
sinking. Die--die--you are forsaken--go down, go down into darkness.
Forsaken--no pity--_I_ shall be forsaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sank in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chair again and broke into sobs. Even Deronda had no
place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consciousness at that moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was completely unmanned.
Instead of finding, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had imagined, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) late experience had
dulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) susceptibility to fresh emotion, it seemed that the lot of
this young creature, whose swift travel from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) bright rash girlhood
into this agony of remorse he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had had to behold in helplessness,
pierced him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) the deeper because it came close upon another sad
revelation of spiritual conflict: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was in one of those moments when
the very anguish of passionate pity makes us ready to choose that we
will know pleasure no more, and live only for the stricken and
afflicted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had risen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) seat while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) watched that terrible
outburst--which seemed the more awful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) because, even in this
supreme agitation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) kept the suppressed voice of one who confesses
in secret. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt impelled to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) back toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and
walk to a distance.

<p/>But presently there was stillness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind had opened to the sense
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had gone away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). When Deronda turned round to approach
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face bent toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes dilated, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips
parted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was an image of timid forlorn beseeching--too timid to
entreat in words while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) kept himself aloof from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) forsaken
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)--now--already? But his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes met hers sorrowfully--met hers for
the first time fully since she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``You know I am a guilty
woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and that full glance in its intense mournfulness seemed to say,
<div class="bookquote">``I know it, but I shall all the less forsake you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
side again in the same attitude--without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
and without again taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Once more Gwendolen was pierced, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been by his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face of sorrow
at the Abbey, with a compunction less egoistic than that which urged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to confess, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, in a tone of loving regret--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I make you very unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda gave an indistinct <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>just shrinking together and changing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) attitude a little. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had gathered resolution enough to say
clearly, <div class="bookquote">``There is no question of being happy or unhappy. What I most
desire at this moment is what will most help you. Tell me all you feel
it a relief to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Devoted as these words were, they widened his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) spiritual distance from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt it more difficult to speak: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had a vague need of
getting nearer to that compassion which seemed to be regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from
a halo of superiority, and the need turned into an impulse to humble
herself more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was ready to throw herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knees before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>);
but no--her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wonderfully mixed consciousness held checks on that
impulse, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was kept silent and motionless by the pressure of
opposing needs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stillness made Deronda at last say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you are too weary. Shall I go away, and come again whenever
you wish it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen--the dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) bringing back
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) power of speech. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) low-toned eagerness, <div class="bookquote">``I want
to tell you what it was that came over me in that boat. I was full of
rage at being obliged to go--full of rage--and I could do nothing but
sit there like a galley slave. And then we got away--out of the
port--into the deep--and everything was still--and we never looked at
each other, only he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) spoke to order me--and the very light about me
seemed to hold me a prisoner and force me to sit as I did. It came over
me that when I was a child I used to fancy sailing away into a world
where people were not forced to live with any one they did not like--I
did not like my father-in-law to come home. And now, I thought, just
the opposite had come to me. I had stepped into a boat, and my life was
a sailing and sailing away--gliding on and no help--always into
solitude with _him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)_, away from deliverance. And because I felt more
helpless than ever, my thoughts went out over worse things--I longed
for worse things--I had cruel wishes--I fancied impossible ways of--I
did not want to die myself; I was afraid of our being drowned together.
If it had been any use I should have prayed--I should have prayed that
something might befall him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>). I should have prayed that he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) might sink out
of my sight and leave me alone. I knew no way of killing him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) there, but
I did, I did kill him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) in my thoughts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sank into silence for a minute, submerged by the weight of memory
which no words could represent.

<p/>``But yet, all the while I felt that I was getting more wicked. And what
had been with me so much, came to me just then--what you once
said--about dreading to increase my wrong-doing and my remorse--I
should hope for nothing then. It was all like a writing of fire within
me. Getting wicked was misery--being shut out forever from knowing what
you--what better lives were. That had always been coming back to me
then--but yet with a despair--a feeling that it was no use--evil wishes
were too strong. I remember then letting go the tiller and saying ``God
help me!<div class="bookquote">'' But then I was forced to take it again and go on; and the
evil longings, the evil prayers came again and blotted everything else
dim, till, in the midst of them--I don't know how it was--he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
turning the sail--there was a gust--he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was struck--I know nothing--I
only know that I saw my wish outside me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began to speak more hurriedly, and in more of a whisper.

<p/>``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sink, and my heart gave a leap as if it were going out of
me. I think I did not move. I kept my hands tight. It was long enough
for me to be glad, and yet to think it was no use--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would come up
again. And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) _was_ come--farther off--the boat had moved. It was all
like lightning. ``The rope!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) called out in a voice--not his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own--I
hear it now--and I stooped for the rope--I felt I must--I felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
could swim, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would come back whether or not, and I dreaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).
That was in my mind--he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would come back. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was gone down again,
and I had the rope in my hand--no, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was again--his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face above
the water--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) cried again--and I held my hand, and my heart said,
``Die!'--an'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sank; and I felt <div class="bookquote">``It is done--I am wicked, I am
lost!--and I had the rope in my hand--I don't know what I thought--I
was leaping away from myself--I would have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) then. I was
leaping from my crime, and there it was--close to me as I fell--there
was the dead face--dead, dead. It can never be altered. That was what
happened. That was what I did. You know it all. It can never be
altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sank back in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chair, exhausted with the agitation of memory and
speech. Deronda felt the burden on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) spirit less heavy than the
foregoing dread. The word <div class="bookquote">``guilty''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>had held a possibility of
interpretations worse than the fact; and Gwendolen's confession, for
the very reason that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) conscience made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dwell on the determining
power of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) evil thoughts, convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) the more that there had been
throughout a counterbalancing struggle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) better will. It seemed
almost certain that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) murderous thought had had no outward
effect--that, quite apart from it, the death was inevitable. Still, a
question as to the outward effectiveness of a criminal desire dominant
enough to impel even a momentary act, cannot alter our judgment of the
desire; and Deronda shrank from putting that question forward in the
first instance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) held it likely that Gwendolen's remorse aggravated
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) inward guilt, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gave the character of decisive action to
what had been an inappreciably instantaneous glance of desire. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
remorse was the precious sign of a recoverable nature; it was the
culmination of that self-disapproval which had been the awakening of a
new life within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); it marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) off from the criminals whose only
regret is failure in securing their evil wish. Deronda could not utter
one word to diminish that sacred aversion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) worst self--that
thorn-pressure which must come with the crowning of the sorrowful
better, suffering because of the worse. All this mingled thought and
feeling kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) silent; speech was too momentous to be ventured on
rashly. There were no words of comfort that did not carry some
sacrilege. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) lips to speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could only have
echoed, <div class="bookquote">``It can never be altered--it remains unaltered, to alter other
things.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was silent and motionless--he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) did not know how
long--before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) turned to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sunk back with
closed eyes, like a lost, weary, storm-beaten white doe, unable to rise
and pursue its unguided way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rose and stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). The movement
touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) consciousness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes with a slight
quivering that seemed like fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must rest now. Try to rest: try to sleep. And may I see you again
this evening--to-morrow--when you have had some rest? Let us say no
more now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The tears came, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not answer except by a slight movement of
the head. Deronda rang for attendance, spoke urgently of the necessity
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should be got to rest, and then left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER LVII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The unripe grape, the ripe, and the dried. All things are changes,
not into nothing, but into that which is not at present.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--MARCUS
AURELIUS.

<p/>Deeds are the pulse of Time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) beating life,
And righteous or unrighteous, being done,
Must throb in after-throbs till Time itself
Be laid in darkness, and the universe
Quiver and breathe upon no mirror more.


<p/>In the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) again. It was already near the hour at
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been brought in from the sea the evening before, and the
light was subdued enough with blinds drawn up and windows open. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
seated gazing fixedly on the sea, resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cheek on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand,
looking less shattered than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), but with a deep
melancholy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) expression which as Deronda approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) passed
into an anxious timidity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand, but said, <div class="bookquote">``How
long ago it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Then, <div class="bookquote">``Will you sit near me again a little while?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) placed himself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) side as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had done before, and seeing that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with that indefinable expression which implies a wish
to say something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to speak. But again she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked
toward the window silently, and again turned with the same expression,
which yet did not issue in speech. There was some fear hindering her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
and Deronda, wishing to relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) timidity, averted his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face.
Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cry imploringly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not say that any one else should know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most decidedly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``There is no action that ought to
be taken in consequence. There is no injury that could be righted in
that way. There is no retribution that any mortal could apportion
justly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was so still during a pause that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seemed to be holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
breath before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I had not had that murderous will--that moment--if I had thrown
the rope on the instant--perhaps it would have hindered death?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, slowly. <div class="bookquote">``If it were true that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could
swim, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must have been seized with cramp. With your quickest, utmost
effort, it seems impossible that you could have done anything to save
him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). That momentary murderous will cannot, I think, have altered the
course of events. Its effect is confined to the motives in your own
breast. Within ourselves our evil will is momentous, and sooner or
later it works its way outside us--it may be in the vitiation that
breeds evil acts, but also it may be in the self-abhorrence that stings
us into better striving.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am saved from robbing others--there are others--they will have
everything--they will have what they ought to have. I knew that some
time before I left town. You do not suspect me of wrong desires about
those things?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoke hesitatingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had not thought of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda; <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking too much of
the other things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you don't quite know the beginning of it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
slowly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were overcoming her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) reluctance. ``There was some one
else he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ought to have married. And I knew it, and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) I would
not hinder it. And I went away--that was when you first saw me. But
then we became poor all at once, and I was very miserable, and I was
tempted. I thought, ``I shall do as I like and make everything right.<div class="bookquote">'' I
persuaded myself. And it was all different. It was all dreadful. Then
came hatred and wicked thoughts. That was how it all came. I told you I
was afraid of myself. And I did what you told me--I did try to make my
fear a safeguard. I thought of what would be if I--I felt what would
come--how I should dread the morning--wishing it would be always
night--and yet in the darkness always seeing something--seeing death.
If you did not know how miserable I was, you might--but now it has all
been no use. I can care for nothing but saving the rest from
knowing--poor mamma, who has never been happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence again before she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said with a repressed sob--<div class="bookquote">``You
cannot bear to look at me any more. You think I am too wicked. You do
not believe that I can become any better--worth anything--worthy
enough--I shall always be too wicked to--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The voice broke off helpless.

<p/>Deronda's heart was pierced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) poor beseeching
face and said, <div class="bookquote">``I believe that you may become worthier than you have
ever yet been--worthy to lead a life that may be a blessing. No evil
dooms us hopelessly except the evil we love, and desire to continue in,
and make no effort to escape from. You _have_ made efforts--you will go
on making them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you were the beginning of them. You must not forsake me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, leaning with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) clasped hands on the arm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chair and
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), while her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face bore piteous traces of the
life-experience concentrated in the twenty-four hours--that new
terrible life lying on the other side of the deed which fulfills a
criminal desire. <div class="bookquote">``I will bear any penance. I will lead any life you
tell me. But you must not forsake me. You must be near. If you had been
near me--if I could have said everything to you, I should have been
different. You will not forsake me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It could never be my impulse to forsake you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda promptly,
with that voice which, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes, had the unintentional effect of
making his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ready sympathy seem more personal and special than it really
was. And in that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was not himself quite free from a foreboding
of some such self-committing effect. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) strong feeling for this
stricken creature could not hinder rushing images of future difficulty.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) continued to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) appealing eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) spoke, but it was with
the painful consciousness that to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ear his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) words might carry a
promise which one day would seem unfulfilled: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was making an
indefinite promise to an indefinite hope. Anxieties, both immediate and
distant, crowded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought, and it was under their influence that,
after a moment's silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect Sir Hugo Mallinger to arrive by to-morrow night at least; and
I am not without hope that Mrs. Davilow may shortly follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
presence will be the greatest comfort to you--it will give you a motive
to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) from unnecessary pain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes--I will try. And you will not go away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till after Sir Hugo has come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we shall all go to England?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, not wishing to enter into
particulars.

<p/>Gwendolen looked toward the window again with an expression which
seemed like a gradual awakening to new thoughts. The twilight was
perceptibly deepening, but Deronda could see a movement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes and
hands such as accompanies a return of perception in one who has been
stunned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will always be with Sir Hugo now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said presently, looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You will always live at the Abbey--or else at Diplow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite uncertain where I shall live,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, coloring.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was warned by his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) changed color that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had spoken too rashly, and
fell silent. After a little while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began, again looking away--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible to think how my life will go on. I think now it would
be better for me to be poor and obliged to work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``New promptings will come as the days pass. When you are among your
friends again, you will discern new duties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``Make it a
task now to get as well and calm--as much like yourself as you can,
before--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before my mother comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! I must be changed. I
have not looked at myself. Should you have known me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) added,
turning toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if you had met me now?--should you have known me
for the one you saw at Leubronn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I should have known you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``The outside
change is not great. I should have seen at once that it was you, and
that you had gone through some great sorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't wish now that you had never seen me; don't wish that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen, imploringly, while the tears gathered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should despise myself for wishing it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``How could I
know what I was wishing? We must find our duties in what comes to us,
not in what we imagine might have been. If I took to foolish wishing of
that sort, I should wish--not that I had never seen you, but that I had
been able to save you from this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have saved me from worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, in a sobbing voice. <div class="bookquote">``I
should have been worse if it had not been for you. If you had not been
good, I should have been more wicked than I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be better for me to go now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, worn in spirit by
the perpetual strain of this scene. <div class="bookquote">``Remember what we said of your
task--to get well and calm before other friends come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) spoke, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand submissively. But when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sank on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knees, in hysterical crying. The
distance between them was too great. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was a banished soul--beholding
a possible life which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had sinned herself away from.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was found in this way, crushed on the floor. Such grief seemed
natural in a poor lady whose husband had been drowned in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) presence.




<p/>BOOK VIII.--FRUIT AND SEED.


<p/>CHAPTER LVIII.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Much adoe there was, God wot;
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wold love and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wold not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--NICHOLAS BRETON.


<p/>Extension, we know, is a very imperfect measure of things; and the
length of the sun's journeying can no more tell us how life has
advanced than the acreage of a field can tell us what growths may be
active within it. A man may go south, and, stumbling over a bone, may
meditate upon it till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has found a new starting-point for anatomy; or
eastward, and discover a new key to language telling a new story of
races; or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may head an expedition that opens new continental
pathways, get himself maimed in body, and go through a whole heroic
poem of resolve and endurance; and at the end of a few months he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may
come back to find his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbors grumbling at the same parish grievance
as before, or to see the same elderly gentleman treading the pavement
in discourse with himself, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head after the same percussive
butcher's boy, and pausing at the same shop-window to look at the same
prints. If the swiftest thinking has about the pace of a greyhound, the
slowest must be supposed to move, like the limpet, by an apparent
sticking, which after a good while is discerned to be a slight
progression. Such differences are manifest in the variable intensity
which we call human experience, from the revolutionary rush of change
which makes a new inner and outer life, to that quiet recurrence of the
familiar, which has no other epochs than those of hunger and the
heavens.

<p/>Something of this contrast was seen in the year's experience which had
turned the brilliant, self-confident Gwendolen Harleth of the Archery
Meeting into the crushed penitent impelled to confess her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) unworthiness
where it would have been her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) happiness to be held worthy; while it had
left her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) family in Pennicote without deeper change than that of some
outward habits, and some adjustment of prospects and intentions to
reduced income, fewer visits, and fainter compliments. The rectory was
as pleasant a home as before: and the red and pink peonies on the lawn,
the rows of hollyhocks by the hedges, had bloomed as well this year as
last: the rector maintained his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) cheerful confidence in the good will of
patrons and his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) resolution to deserve it by diligence in the
fulfillment of his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) duties, whether patrons were likely to hear of it or
not; doing nothing solely with an eye to promotion except, perhaps, the
writing of two ecclesiastical articles, which having no signature, were
attributed to some one else, except by the patrons who had a special
copy sent them, and these certainly knew the author but did not read
the articles. The rector, however, chewed no poisonous cud of suspicion
on this point: he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) made marginal notes on his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) own copies to render them
a more interesting loan, and was gratified that the Archdeacon and
other authorities had nothing to say against the general tenor of his (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>)
argument. Peaceful authorship!--living in the air of the fields and
downs, and not in the thrice-breathed breath of criticism--bringing no
Dantesque leanness; rather, assisting nutrition by complacency, and
perhaps giving a more suffusive sense of achievement than the
production of a whole _Divina Commedia_. Then there was the father's
recovered delight in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) favorite son, which was a happiness
outweighing the loss of eighteen hundred a year. Of whatever nature
might be the hidden change wrought in Rex by the disappointment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
first love, it was apparently quite secondary to that evidence of more
serious ambition which dated from the family misfortune; indeed, Mr.
Gascoigne was inclined to regard the little affair which had caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)
so much anxiety the year before as an evaporation of superfluous
moisture, a kind of finish to the baking process which the human dough
demands. Rex had lately come down for a summer visit to the rectory,
bringing Anna home, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) showed nearly the old liveliness with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) brothers and sisters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) continued in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) holiday the habits of the
eager student, rising early in the morning and shutting himself up
early in the evenings to carry on a fixed course of study.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't repent the choice of the law as a profession, Rex?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no profession I would choose before it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex. ``I should
like to end my life as a first-rate judge, and help to draw up a code.
I reverse the famous dictum. I should say, <div class="bookquote">``Give me something to do

suppose--that's the worst of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>said the rector.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that law-rubbish is worse than any other sort. It is not
so bad as the rubbishy literature that people choke their minds with.
It doesn't make one so dull. Our wittiest men have often been lawyers.
Any orderly way of looking at things as cases and evidence seems to me
better than a perpetual wash of odds and ends bearing on nothing in
particular. And then, from a higher point of view, the foundations and
the growth of law make the most interesting aspects of philosophy and
history. Of course there will be a good deal that is troublesome,
drudging, perhaps exasperating. But the great prizes in life can't be
won easily--I see that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my boy, the best augury of a man's success in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) profession is
that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thinks it the finest in the world. But I fancy it so with most
work when a man goes into it with a will. Brewitt, the blacksmith, said
to me the other day that his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) `prentice had no mind to his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) trade; `and
yet, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brewitt</b></font>)</div>said Brewitt, `what would a young fellow have if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) doesn't
like the blacksmithing?''

<p/>The rector cherished a fatherly delight, which he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) allowed to escape him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>)
only in moderation. Warham, who had gone to India, he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) had easily borne
parting with, but Rex was that romance of later life which a man
sometimes finds in a son whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognizes as superior to himself,
picturing a future eminence for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) according to a variety of famous
examples. It was only to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said with decision: <div class="bookquote">``Rex will
be a distinguished man, Nancy, I am sure of it--as sure as Paley's
father was about his (<font color='blue'><b>Paley</b></font>) son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Paley an old bachelor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gascoigne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is hardly to the point, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>said the rector, who did not
remember that irrelevant detail. And Mrs. Gascoigne felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) had
spoken rather weakly.

<p/>This quiet trotting of time at the rectory was shared by the group who
had exchanged the faded dignity of Offendene for the low white house
not a mile off, well enclosed with evergreens, and known to the
villagers, as <div class="bookquote">``Jodson's.''  (<font color='red'><b>the villagers</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Davilow's delicate face showed only a
slight deepening of its mild melancholy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) hair only a few more
silver lines, in consequence of the last year's trials; the four girls
had bloomed out a little from being less in the shade; and the good
Jocosa preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) serviceable neutrality toward the pleasures and
glories of the world as things made for those who were not <div class="bookquote">``in a
situation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jocosa</b></font>)</div><p/>The low narrow drawing-room, enlarged by two quaint projecting windows,
with lattices wide open on a July afternoon to the scent of monthly
roses, the faint murmurs of the garden, and the occasional rare sound
of hoofs and wheels seeming to clarify the succeeding silence, made
rather a crowded, lively scene, Rex and Anna being added to the usual
group of six. Anna, always a favorite with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) younger cousins, had
much to tell of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) new experience, and the acquaintances she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had made
in London, and when on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) first visit she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) came alone, many questions
were asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) about Gwendolen's house in Grosvenor Square, what
Gwendolen herself had said, and what any one else had said about
Gwendolen. Had Anna been to see Gwendolen after she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had known about the
yacht? No:--an answer which left speculation free concerning everything
connected with that interesting unknown vessel beyond the fact that
Gwendolen had written just before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) set out to say that Mr.
Grandcourt and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were going yachting on the Mediterranean, and again
from Marseilles to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was sure to like the yachting, the
cabins were very elegant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would probably not send another
letter till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had written quite a long diary filled with _dittos_.
Also, this movement of Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt had been mentioned in
<div class="bookquote">``the newspaper;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grandcourt</b></font>)</div>so that altogether this new phase of Gwendolen's
exalted life made a striking part of the sisters' romance, the
book-devouring Isabel throwing in a corsair or two to make an adventure
that might end well.

<p/>But when Rex was present, the girls, according to instructions, never
started this fascinating topic, and to-day there had only been animated
descriptions of the Meyricks and their extraordinary Jewish friends,
which caused some astonished questioning from minds to which the idea
of live Jews, out of a book, suggested a difference deep enough to be
almost zoological, as of a strange race in Pliny's Natural History that
might sleep under the shade of its own ears. Bertha could not imagine
what Jews believed now; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertha</b></font>) had a dim idea that they rejected the
Old Testament since it proved the New; Miss Merry thought that Mirah
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) brother could <div class="bookquote">``never have been properly argued with,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>and the
amiable Alice did not mind what the Jews believed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``couldn't bear them.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Davilow corrected her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) by saying that the
great Jewish families who were in society were quite what they ought to
be both in London and Paris, but admitted that the commoner unconverted
Jews were objectionable; and Isabel asked whether Mirah talked just as
they did, or whether you might be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>) and not find out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabel</b></font>)
was a Jewess.

<p/>Rex, who had no partisanship with the Israelites, having made a
troublesome acquaintance with the minutiae of their ancient history in
the form of <div class="bookquote">``cram,''  (<font color='red'><b>a acquaintance</b></font>)</div>was amusing himself by playfully exaggerating the
notion of each speaker, while Anna begged them all to understand that
he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was only joking, when the laughter was interrupted by the bringing
in of a letter for Mrs. Davilow. A messenger had run with it in great
haste from the rectory. It enclosed a telegram, and as Mrs. Davilow
read and re-read it in silence and agitation, all eyes were turned on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) with anxiety, but no one dared to speak. Looking up at last and
seeing the young faces <div class="bookquote">``painted with fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) remembered that they
might be imagining something worse than the truth, something like her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>)
own first dread which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) unable to understand what was written,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) said, with a sob which was half relief--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dears, Mr. Grandcourt--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) paused an instant, and then began
again, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grandcourt is drowned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Rex started up as if a missile had been suddenly thrown into the room.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) could not help himself, and Anna's first look was at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>). But then,
gathering some self-command while Mrs. Davilow was reading what the
rector had written on the enclosing paper, he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I do anything, aunt? Can I carry any word to my father from you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) I will be ready--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is very good. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will
go with me to Genoa--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be here at half-past six. Jocosa and
Alice, help me to get ready. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is safe--Gwendolen is safe--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
must be ill. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) must be very ill. Rex, dear--Rex and
Anna--go and and tell your father I will be quite ready. I would not
for the world lose another night. And bless him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for being ready so
soon. I can travel night and day till we get there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Rex and Anna hurried away through the sunshine which was suddenly
solemn to them, without uttering a word to each other: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) chiefly
possessed by solicitude about any reopening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) wound, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) struggling
with a tumultuary crowd of thoughts that were an offence against his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
better will. The tumult being undiminished when they were at the
rectory gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nannie, I will leave you to say everything to my father. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants
me immediately, let me know. I shall stay in the shrubbery for ten
minutes--only ten minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Who has been quite free from egoistic escapes of the imagination,
picturing desirable consequences on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) own future in the presence of
another's misfortune, sorrow, or death? The expected promotion or
legacy is the common type of a temptation which makes speech and even
prayer a severe avoidance of the most insistent thoughts, and sometimes
raises an inward shame, a self-distaste that is worse than any other
form of unpleasant companionship. In Rex's nature the shame was
immediate, and overspread like an ugly light all the hurrying images of
what might come, which thrust themselves in with the idea that
Gwendolen was again free--overspread them, perhaps, the more
persistently because every phantasm of a hope was quickly nullified by
a more substantial obstacle. Before the vision of <div class="bookquote">``Gwendolen free''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>rose
the impassable vision of <div class="bookquote">``Gwendolen rich, exalted, courted;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and if in
the former time, when both their lives were fresh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had turned from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) love with repugnance, what ground was there for supposing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
heart would be more open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) in the future?

<p/>These thoughts, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) wanted to master and suspend, were like a
tumultuary ringing of opposing chimes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) could not escape from by
running. During the last year he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had brought himself into a state of
calm resolve, and now it seemed that three words had been enough to
undo all that difficult work, and cast him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) back into the wretched
fluctuations of a longing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) recognized as simply perturbing and
hopeless. And at this moment the activity of such longing had an
untimeliness that made it repulsive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) better self. Excuse poor
Rex; it was not much more than eighteen months since he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had been laid
low by an archer who sometimes touches his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) arrow with a subtle,
lingering poison. The disappointment of a youthful passion has effects
as incalculable as those of small-pox which may make one person plain
and a genius, another less plain and more foolish, another plain
without detriment to his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) folly, and leave perhaps the majority without
obvious change. Everything depends--not on the mere fact of
disappointment, but--on the nature affected and the force that stirs
it. In Rex's well-endowed nature, brief as the hope had been, the
passionate stirring had gone deep, and the effect of disappointment was
revolutionary, though fraught with a beneficent new order which
retained most of the old virtues; in certain respects he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) believed that
it had finally determined the bias and color of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) life. Now, however,
it seemed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) inward peace was hardly more than that of republican
Florence, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) heart no better than the alarm-bell that made work
slack and tumult busy.

<p/>Rex's love had been of that sudden, penetrating, clinging sort which
the ancients knew and sung, and in singing made a fashion of talk for
many moderns whose experience has by no means a fiery, demonic
character. To have the consciousness suddenly steeped with another's
personality, to have the strongest inclinations possessed by an image
which retains its dominance in spite of change and apart from
worthiness--nay, to feel a passion which clings faster for the tragic
pangs inflicted by a cruel, reorganized unworthiness--is a phase of
love which in the feeble and common-minded has a repulsive likeness to
his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) blind animalism insensible to the higher sway of moral affinity or
heaven-lit admiration. But when this attaching force is present in a
nature not of brutish unmodifiableness, but of a human dignity that can
risk itself safely, it may even result in a devotedness not unfit to be
called divine in a higher sense than the ancient. Phlegmatic
rationality stares and shakes its head at these unaccountable
prepossessions, but they exist as undeniably as the winds and waves,
determining here a wreck and there a triumphant voyage.

<p/>This sort of passion had nested in the sweet-natured, strong Rex, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) mind to its companionship, as if it had been an
object supremely dear, stricken dumb and helpless, and turning all the
future of tenderness into a shadow of the past. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had also made up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) mind that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) life was not to be pauperized because he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had had to
renounce one sort of joy; rather, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had begun life again with a new
counting-up of the treasures that remained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) had even felt
a release of power such as may come from ceasing to be afraid of your
own neck.

<p/>And now, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) was pacing the shrubbery, angry with himself that the
sense of irrevocableness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) lot, which ought in reason to have been
as strong as ever, had been shaken by a change of circumstances that
could make no change in relation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) told himself the truth
quite roughly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) would never love me; and that is not the question--I could never
approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) as a lover in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) present position. I am exactly of no
consequence at all, and am not likely to be of much consequence till my
head is turning gray. But what has that to do with it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) would not
have me on any terms, and I would not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>). It is a meanness to be
thinking about it now--no better than lurking about the battle-field to
strip the dead; but there never was more gratuitous sinning. I have
nothing to gain there--absolutely nothing. Then why can't I face the
facts, and behave as they demand, instead of leaving my father to
suppose that there are matters he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can't speak to me about, though I
might be useful in them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>The last thought made one wave with the impulse that sent Rex walking
firmly into the house and through the open door of the study, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) father packing a traveling-desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I be of any use, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, with rallied courage, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>)
father looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my boy; when I'm gone, just see to my letters, and answer where
necessary, and send me word of everything. Dymock will manage the
parish very well, and you will stay with your mother, or, at least, go
up and down again, till I come back, whenever that may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will hardly be very long, sir, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, beginning to
strap a railway rug. <div class="bookquote">``You will perhaps bring my cousin back to
England?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) forced himself to speak of Gwendolen for the first time,
and the rector noticed the epoch with satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) answered, taking the subject as a matter-of-course
between them. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother may stay there with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and I may
come back very soon. This telegram leaves us in ignorance which is
rather anxious. But no doubt the arrangements of the will lately made
are satisfactory, and there may possibly be an heir yet to be born. In
any case, I feel confident that Gwendolen will be liberally--I should
expect, splendidly--provided for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must have been a great shock for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Rex, getting more
resolute after the first twinge had been borne. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) was a
devoted husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div>said the rector, in his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) most decided manner. <div class="bookquote">``Few men
of his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) position would have come forward as he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) did under the
circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rex/Gascoigne/Rex Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/>Rex had never seen Grandcourt, had never been spoken to about him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) by
any one of the family, and knew nothing of Gwendolen's flight from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
suitor to Leubronn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) only knew that Grandcourt, being very much in
love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) an offer in the first weeks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sudden
poverty, and had behaved very handsomely in providing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother
and sisters. That was all very natural and what Rex himself would have
liked to do. Grandcourt had been a lucky fellow, and had had some
happiness before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) got drowned. Yet Rex wondered much whether
Gwendolen had been in love with the successful suitor, or had only
forborne to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hated being made love to.




<p/>CHAPTER LIX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I count myself in nothing else so happy
As in a soul remembering my good friends.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Shakespeare/SHAKESPEARE</b></font>)</div>--SHAKESPEARE.


<p/>Sir Hugo Mallinger was not so prompt in starting for Genoa as Mr.
Gascoigne had been, and Deronda on all accounts would not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>)
departure until he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) had seen the baronet. There was not only
Grandcourt's death, but also the late crisis in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own life to make
reasons why his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) oldest friend would desire to have the unrestrained
communication of speech with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), for in writing he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had not felt able
to give any details concerning the mother who had come and gone like an
apparition. It was not till the fifth evening that Deronda, according
to telegram, waited for Sir Hugo at the station, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was to arrive
between eight and nine; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was looking forward to the sight
of the kind, familiar face, which was part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) earliest memories,
something like a smile, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) late tragic experience, might
have been detected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) eyes and the curve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) lips at the idea of
Sir Hugo's pleasure in being now master of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) estates, able to leave
them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) daughters, or at least--according to a view of inheritance
which had just been strongly impressed on Deronda's imagination--to
take makeshift feminine offspring as intermediate to a satisfactory
heir in a grandson. We should be churlish creatures if we could have no
joy in our fellow-mortals' joy, unless it were in agreement with our
theory of righteous distribution and our highest ideal of human good:
what sour corners our mouths would get--our eyes, what frozen glances!
and all the while our own possessions and desires would not exactly
adjust themselves to our ideal. We must have some comradeship with
imperfection; and it is, happily, possible to feel gratitude even where
we discern a mistake that may have been injurious, the vehicle of the
mistake being an affectionate intention prosecuted through a life-time
of kindly offices. Deronda's feeling and judgment were strongly against
the action of Sir Hugo in making himself the agent of a falsity--yes, a
falsity: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) could give no milder name to the concealment under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
had been reared. But the baronet had probably had no clear knowledge
concerning the mother's breach of trust, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) light, easy way
of taking life, had held it a reasonable preference in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son
should be made an English gentleman, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had the
eccentricity of not caring to part from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child, and be to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were not. Daniel's affectionate gratitude toward Sir Hugo made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
wish to find grounds of excuse rather than blame; for it is as possible
to be rigid in principle and tender in blame, as it is to suffer from
the sight of things hung awry, and yet to be patient with the hanger
who sees amiss. If Sir Hugo in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) bachelorhood had been beguiled into
regarding children chiefly as a product intended to make life more
agreeable to the full-grown, whose convenience alone was to be
consulted in the disposal of them--why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had shared an assumption
which, if not formally avowed, was massively acted on at that date of
the world's history; and Deronda, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) keen memory of the
painful inward struggle he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had gone through in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) boyhood, was able
also to remember the many signs that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) experience had been entirely
shut out from Sir Hugo's conception. Ignorant kindness may have the
effect of cruelty; but to be angry with it as if it were direct cruelty
would be an ignorant _un_kindness, the most remote from Deronda's large
imaginative lenience toward others. And perhaps now, after the
searching scenes of the last ten days, in which the curtain had been
lifted for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) from the secrets of lives unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was more
than ever disposed to check that rashness of indignation or resentment
which has an unpleasant likeness to the love of punishing. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw
Sir Hugo's familiar figure descending from the railway carriage, the
life-long affection which had been well accustomed to make excuses,
flowed in and submerged all newer knowledge that might have seemed
fresh ground for blame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Dan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, with a serious fervor, grasping Deronda's
hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) uttered no other words of greeting; there was too strong a
rush of mutual consciousness. The next thing was to give orders to the
courier, and then to propose walking slowly in, the mild evening, there
being no hurry to get to the hotel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have taken my journey easily, and am in excellent condition,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>)
said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) and Deronda came out under the starlight, which was still
faint with the lingering sheen of day. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't hurry in setting off,
because I wanted to inquire into things a little, and so I got sight of
your letter to Lady Mallinger before I started. But now, how is the
widow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Getting calmer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) seems to be escaping the bodily
illness that one might have feared for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), after her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) plunge and
terrible excitement. Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) uncle and mother came two days ago, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) is
being well taken care of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any prospect of an heir being born?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From what Mr. Gascoigne said to me, I conclude not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) spoke as if it
were a question whether the widow would have the estates for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will not be much of a wrench to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) affections, I fancy, this loss
of the husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, looking round at Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The suddenness of the death has been a great blow to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, quietly evading the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether Grandcourt gave her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) any notion what were the
provisions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) will?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what they are, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>parried Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet, quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Gad! if there is no prospect
of a legitimate heir, he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) has left everything to a boy he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) had by a Mrs.
Glasher; you know nothing about the affair, I suppose, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Glasher</b></font>) was a
sort of wife to him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) for a good many years, and there are three older
children--girls. The boy is to take his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's name; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is Henleigh
already, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is to be Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt. The Mallinger
will be of no use to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>), I am happy to say; but the young dog will
have more than enough with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) fourteen years' minority--no need to
have had holes filled up with my fifty thousand for Diplow that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) had
no right to: and meanwhile my beauty, the young widow, is to put up
with a poor two thousand a year and the house at Gadsmere--a nice kind
of banishment for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) chose to shut herself up there, which I
don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) will. The boy's mother has been living there of late
years. I'm perfectly disgusted with Grandcourt. I don't know that I'm
obliged to think the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)'s drowned, though, so far
as my affairs are concerned, nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) life became him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) like the
leaving it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In my opinion he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) did wrong when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) married this wife--not in leaving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) estates to the son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, rather dryly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say nothing against his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) leaving the land to the lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo;
<div class="bookquote">``but since he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had married this girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) ought to have given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a
handsome provision, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could live on in a style fitted to the
rank he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had raised her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ought to have had four or five thousand
a year and the London house for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life; that's what I should have
done for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). I suppose, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was penniless, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends couldn't
stand out for a settlement, else it's ill trusting to the will a man
may make after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s married. Even a wise man generally lets some folly
ooze out of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will--my father did, I know; and if a fellow has
any spite or tyranny in him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s likely to bottle off a good deal for
keeping in that sort of document. It's quite clear Grandcourt meant
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) death should put an extinguisher on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wife, if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
no heir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, in the other case, I suppose everything would have been
reversed--illegitimacy would have had the extinguisher?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
with some scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely--Gadsmere and the two thousand. It's queer. One nuisance is
that Grandcourt has made me an executor; but seeing he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was the son of
my only brother, I can't refuse to act. And I shall mind it less if I
can be of any use to the widow. Lush thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was not in ignorance
about the family under the rose, and the purport of the will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) hints
that there was no very good understanding between the couple. But I
fancy you are the man who knew most about what Mrs. Grandcourt felt or
did not feel--eh, Dan?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>Sir Hugo did not put this question with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
usual jocoseness, but rather with a lowered tone of interested inquiry;
and Deronda felt that any evasion would be misinterpreted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answered
gravely--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was certainly not happy. They were unsuited to each other. But as
to the disposal of the property--from all I have seen of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>), I should
predict that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) will be quite contented with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) is not much like the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) sex; that's all I can say,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, with a slight shrug. ``However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) ought to be something
extraordinary, for there must be an entanglement between your horoscope
and hers--eh? When that tremendous telegram came, the first thing Lady
Mallinger said was, ``How very strange that it should be Daniel who
sends it!<div class="bookquote">'' But I have had something of the same sort in my own life. I
was once at a foreign hotel where a lady had been left by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband
without money. When I heard of it, and came forward to help her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), who
should she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) be but an early flame of mine, who had been fool enough to
marry an Austrian baron with a long mustache and short affection? But
it was an affair of my own that called me there--nothing to do with
knight-errantry, any more than you coming to Genoa had to do with the
Grandcourts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence for a little while. Sir Hugo had begun to talk of the
Grandcourts as the less difficult subject between himself and Deronda;
but they were both wishing to overcome a reluctance to perfect
frankness on the events which touched their relation to each other.
Deronda felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) letter, after the first interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
mother, had been rather a thickening than a breaking of the ice, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ought to wait for the first opening to come from Sir Hugo. Just
when they were about to lose sight of the port, the baronet turned, and
pausing as if to get a last view, said in a tone of more serious
feeling--<div class="bookquote">``And about the main business of your coming to Genoa, Dan? You
have not been deeply pained by anything you have learned, I hope? There
is nothing that you feel need change your position in any way? You
know, whatever happens to you must always be of importance to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I desire to meet your goodness by perfect confidence, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``But I can't answer those questions truly by a simple yes or
no. Much that I have heard about the past has pained me. And it has
been a pain to meet and part with my mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suffering state, as
I have been compelled to do, But it is no pain--it is rather a clearing
up of doubts for which I am thankful, to know my parentage. As to the
effect on my position, there will be no change in my gratitude to you,
sir, for the fatherly care and affection you have always shown me. But
to know that I was born a Jew, may have a momentous influence on my
life, which I am hardly able to tell you of at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda spoke the last sentence with a resolve that overcame some
diffidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt that the differences between Sir Hugo's nature and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) own would have, by-and-by, to disclose themselves more markedly
than had ever yet been needful. The baronet gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) a quick glance,
and turned to walk on. After a few moments' silence, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had
reviewed all the material in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) memory which would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) to
interpret Deronda's words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have long expected something remarkable from you, Dan; but, for
God's sake, don't go into any eccentricities! I can tolerate any man's
difference of opinion, but let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tell it me without getting himself
up as a lunatic. At this stage of the world, if a man wants to be taken
seriously, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must keep clear of melodrama. Don't misunderstand me. I
am not suspecting you of setting up any lunacy on your own account. I
only think you might easily be led arm in arm with a lunatic,
especially if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted defending. You have a passion for people who
are pelted, Dan. I'm sorry for them too; but so far as company goes,
it's a bad ground of selection. However, I don't ask you to anticipate
your inclination in anything you have to tell me. When you make up your
mind to a course that requires money, I have some sixteen thousand
pounds that have been accumulating for you over and above what you have
been having the interest of as income. And now I am come, I suppose you
want to get back to England as soon as you can?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go first to Mainz to get away a chest of my grandfather's, and
perhaps to see a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``Although the chest has
been lying there these twenty years, I have an unreasonable sort of
nervous eagerness to get it away under my care, as if it were more
likely now than before that something might happen to it. And perhaps I
am the more uneasy, because I lingered after my mother left, instead of
setting out immediately. Yet I can't regret that I was here--else Mrs.
Grandcourt would have had none but servants to act for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, with a flippancy which was an escape of some
vexation hidden under his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) more serious speech; <div class="bookquote">``I hope you are not
going to set a dead Jew above a living Christian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda colored, and repressed a retort. They were just turning into
the _Italia_.




<p/>CHAPTER LX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall say no more of this at this time; for this is to be felt
and not to be talked of; and they who never touched it with their
fingers may secretly perhaps laugh at it in their hearts and be never
the wiser.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--JEREMY TAYLOR.

<p/>The Roman Emperor in the legend put to death ten learned Israelites to
avenge the sale of Joseph by his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) brethren. And there have always been
enough of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) kidney, whose piety lies in punishing who can see the
justice of grudges but not of gratitude. For you shall never convince
the stronger feeling that it hath not the stronger reason, or incline
him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) who hath no love to believe that there is good ground for loving.
As we may learn from the order of word-making, wherein _love_
precedeth _lovable_.


<p/>When Deronda presented his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) letter at the banking-house in the _Schuster
Strasse_ at Mainz, and asked for Joseph Kalonymos, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) was presently
shown into an inner room, where, seated at a table arranging open
letters, was the white-bearded man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen the year before in
the synagogue at Frankfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat--it seemed to be the same
old felt hat as before--and near him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a packed portmanteau with a
wrap and overcoat upon it. On seeing Deronda enter he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rose, but did not
advance or put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand. Looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with small penetrating eyes
which glittered like black gems in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) yellowish face and
white hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said in German--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! It is now you who seek me, young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>German</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I seek you with gratitude, as a friend of my grandfather's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``and I am under an obligation to you for giving yourself much
trouble on my account.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) spoke without difficulty in that liberal
German tongue which takes many strange accents to its maternal bosom.

<p/>Kalonymos now put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) hand and said cordially, <div class="bookquote">``So you are no
longer angry at being something more than an Englishman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joseph Kalonymos/Kalonymos/Joseph</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary. I thank you heartily for helping to save me from
remaining in ignorance of my parentage, and for taking care of the
chest that my grandfather left in trust for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph Kalonymos/Kalonymos/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Kalonymos, in a quick undertone, seating
himself again, and pointing to a chair near him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>). Then deliberately
laying aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) hat and showing a head thickly covered, with white
hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) stroked and clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) beard while he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) looked examiningly at
the young face before him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>). The moment wrought strongly on Deronda's
imaginative susceptibility: in the presence of one linked still in
zealous friendship with the grandfather whose hope had yearned toward
him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was unborn, and who, though dead, was yet to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
in those written memorials which, says Milton, <div class="bookquote">``contain a potency of
life in them to be as active as that soul whose progeny they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Milton/MILTON</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>)
seemed to himself to be touching the electric chain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) own
ancestry; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) bore the scrutinizing look of Kalonymos with a
delighted awe, something like what one feels in the solemn
commemoration of acts done long ago but still telling markedly on the
life of to-day. Impossible for men of duller, fibre--men whose
affection is not ready to diffuse itself through the wide travel of
imagination, to comprehend, perhaps even to credit this sensibility of
Deronda's; but it subsisted, like their own dullness, notwithstanding
their lack of belief in it--and it gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face an expression which
seemed very satisfactory to the observer.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said in Hebrew, quoting from one of the fine hymns in the Hebrew
liturgy, <div class="bookquote">``As thy goodness has been great to the former generations,
even so may it be to the latter.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Then after pausing a little he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) began,
``Young man, I rejoice that I was not yet set off again on my travels,
and that you are come in time for me to see the image of my friend as
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) youth--no longer perverted from the fellowship of your
people--no longer shrinking in proud wrath from the touch of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) who
seemed to be claiming you as a Jew. You come with thankfulness yourself
to claim the kindred and heritage that wicked contrivance would have
robbed you of. You come with a willing soul to declare, ``I am the
grandson of Daniel Charisi.<div class="bookquote">'' Is it not so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daniel Charisi/Charisi</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Assuredly it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. ``But let me say that I should at no
time have been inclined to treat a Jew with incivility simply because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was a Jew. You can understand that I shrank from saying to a
stranger, <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of my mother.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sin, a sin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph Kalonymos/Kalonymos/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Kalonymos, putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) hand and closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>)
eyes in disgust. ``A robbery of our people--as when our youths and
maidens were reared for the Roman Edom. But it is frustrated. I have
frustrated it. When Daniel Charisi--may his (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>) Rock and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>) Redeemer guard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>)!--when Daniel Charisi was a stripling and I was a lad little above
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>) shoulder, we made a solemn vow always to be friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>) said, ``Let
us bind ourselves with duty, as if we were sons of the same mother.''
That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) bent from first to last--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) said, to fortify his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) soul
with bonds. It was a saying of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>), ``Let us bind love with duty; for
duty is the love of law; and law is the nature of the Eternal.<div class="bookquote">'' So we
bound ourselves. And though we were much apart in our later life, the
bond has never been broken. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) was dead, they sought to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>);
but they could not rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) of me. I rescued that remainder of him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) had prized and preserved for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) offspring. And I have restored to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) the offspring they had robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) of. I will bring you the chest
forthwith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Eternal</b></font>)</div><p/>Kalonymos left the room for a few minutes, and returned with a clerk
who carried the chest, set it down on the floor, drew off a leather
cover, and went out again. It was not very large, but was made heavy by
ornamental bracers and handles of gilt iron. The wood was beautifully
incised with Arabic lettering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph Kalonymos/Kalonymos/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Kalonymos, returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">``And here is the curious
key,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) added, taking it from a small leathern bag. <div class="bookquote">``Bestow it
carefully. I trust you are methodic and wary.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) gave Deronda the
monitory and slightly suspicious look with which age is apt to commit
any object to the keeping of youth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be more careful of this than of any other property,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, smiling and putting the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) breast-pocket. <div class="bookquote">``I never
before possessed anything that was a sign to me of so much cherished
hope and effort. And I shall never forget that the effort was partly
yours. Have you time to tell me more of my grandfather? Or shall I be
trespassing in staying longer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay yet a while. In an hour and eighteen minutes I start for
Trieste,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph Kalonymos/Kalonymos/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Kalonymos, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) watch, <div class="bookquote">``and presently my sons
will expect my attention. Will you let me make you known to them, so
that they may have the pleasure of showing hospitality to my friend's
grandson? They dwell here in ease and luxury, though I choose to be a
wanderer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joseph Kalonymos/Kalonymos/Joseph</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be glad if you will commend me to their acquaintance for some
future opportunity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``There are pressing claims calling
me to England--friends who may be much in need of my presence. I have
been kept away from them too long by unexpected circumstances. But to
know more of you and your family would be motive enough to bring me
again to Mainz.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! Me you will hardly find, for I am beyond my threescore years and
ten, and I am a wanderer, carrying my shroud with me. But my sons and
their children dwell here in wealth and unity. The days are changed for
us since Karl the Great fetched my ancestors from Italy to bring some
tincture of knowledge to our rough German brethren. I and my
contemporaries have had to fight for it too. Our youth fell on evil
days; but this we have won; we increase our wealth in safety, and the
learning of all Germany is fed and fattened by Jewish brains--though
they keep not always their Jewish hearts. Have you been left altogether
ignorant of your people's life, young man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``I have lately, before I had any true suspicion of
my parentage, been led to study everything belonging to their history
with more interest than any other subject. It turns out that I have
been making myself ready to understand my grandfather a little.''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
anxious less the time should be consumed before this circuitous course
of talk could lead them back to the topic he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) most cared about. Age does
not easily distinguish between what it needs to express and what youth
needs to know-distance seeming to level the objects of memory; and
keenly active as Joseph Kalonymos showed himself, an inkstand in the
wrong place would have hindered his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) imagination from getting to
Beyrout: he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) had been used to unite restless travel with punctilious
observation. But Deronda's last sentence answered its purpose.

<p/>``So-you would perhaps have been such a man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if your education had
not hindered; for you are like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in features:--yet not altogether,
young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had an iron will in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face: it braced up everybody
about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite young he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had already got one deep upright
line in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brow. I see none of that in you. Daniel Charisi used to
say, ``Better, a wrong will than a wavering; better a steadfast enemy
than an uncertain friend; better a false belief than no belief at all.<div class="bookquote">''
What he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) despised most was indifference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had longer reasons than I
can give you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knowledge was not narrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, with a tacit
reference to the usual excuse for indecision--that it comes from
knowing too much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Narrow? no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph Kalonymos/Kalonymos/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Kalonymos, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) head with a compassionate
smile ``From his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) childhood upward, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) drank in learning as easily as the
plant sucks up water. But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) early took to medicine and theories about
life and health. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) traveled to many countries, and spent much of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
substance in seeing and knowing. What he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) used to insist on was that the
strength and wealth of mankind depended on the balance of separateness
and communication, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was bitterly against our people losing
themselves among the Gentiles; ``It's no better,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>), `than the
many sorts of grain going back from their variety into sameness.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>)
mingled all sorts of learning; and in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) was like our Arabic
writers in the golden time. We studied together, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) went beyond me.
Though we were bosom friends, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) poured himself out to me, we were
as different as the inside and outside of the bowl. I stood up for two
notions of my own: I took Charisi's sayings as I took the shape of the
trees: they were there, not to be disputed about. It came to the same
thing in both of us; we were both faithful Jews, thankful not to be
Gentiles. And since I was a ripe man, I have been what I am now, for
all but age-loving to wander, loving transactions, loving to behold all
things, and caring nothing about hardship. Charisi thought continually
of our people's future: he (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>) went with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>) soul into that part of our
religion: I, not. So we have freedom, I am content. Our people wandered
before they were driven. Young man when I am in the East, I lie much on
deck and watch the greater stars. The sight of them satisfies me. I
know them as they rise, and hunger not to know more. Charisi was
satisfied with no sight, but pieced it out with what had been before
and what would come after. Yet we loved each other, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>)
bound our love with duty; we solemnly pledged ourselves to help and
defend each other to the last. I have fulfilled my pledge.'' Here
Kalonymos rose, and Deronda, rising also, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And in being faithful to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) you have caused justice to be done to me.
It would have been a robbery of me too that I should never have known
of the inheritance he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had prepared for me. I thank you with my whole
soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), young man. What is your vocation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>This question was
put with a quick abruptness which embarrassed Deronda, who did not feel
it quite honest to allege his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) law-reading as a vocation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say that I have any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get one, get one. The Jew must be diligent. You will call yourself a
Jew and profess the faith of your fathers?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph Kalonymos/Kalonymos/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Kalonymos, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>)
hand on Deronda's shoulder and looking sharply in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalonymos</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall call myself a Jew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, deliberately, becoming
slightly paler under the piercing eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) questioner. <div class="bookquote">``But I will
not say that I shall profess to believe exactly as my fathers have
believed. Our fathers themselves changed the horizon of their belief
and learned of other races. But I think I can maintain my grandfather's
notion of separateness with communication. I hold that my first duty is
to my own people, and if there is anything to be done toward restoring
or perfecting their common life, I shall make that my vocation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>It happened to Deronda at that moment, as it has often happened to
others, that the need for speech made an epoch in resolve. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) respect
for the questioner would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) decline to answer, and by the
necessity to answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) found out the truth for himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you argue and you look forward--you are Daniel Charisi's
grandson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph Kalonymos/Kalonymos/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Kalonymos, adding a benediction in Hebrew.

<p/>With that they parted; and almost as soon as Deronda was in London, the
aged man was again on shipboard, greeting the friendly stars without
any eager curiosity.




<p/>CHAPTER LXI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Within the gentle heart Love shelters him (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>),
As birds within the green shade of the grove.
Before the gentle heart, in Nature's scheme,
Love was not, nor the gentle heart ere Love.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rossetti</b></font>)</div>--GUIDO GUNICELLI -LRB-_Rossetti's Translation_-RRB-.


<p/>There was another house besides the white house at Pennicote, another
breast besides Rex Gascoigne's, in which the news of Grandcourt's death
caused both strong agitation and the effort to repress it.

<p/>It was Hans Meyrick's habit to send or bring in the _Times_ for his (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
mother's reading. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a great reader of news, from the
widest-reaching politics to the list of marriages; the latter, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
said, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the pleasant sense of finishing the fashionable novels
without having read them, and seeing the heroes and heroines happy
without knowing what poor creatures they were. On a Wednesday, there
were reasons why Hans always chose to bring the paper, and to do so
about the time that Mirah had nearly ended giving Mab her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) weekly
lesson, avowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) came then because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) wanted to hear Mirah sing.
But on the particular Wednesday now in question, after entering the
house as quietly as usual with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) latch-key, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) appeared in the
parlor, shaking the _Times_ aloft with a crackling noise, in
remorseless interruption of Mab's attempt to render _Lascia ch`io
pianga_ with a remote imitation of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) teacher. Piano and song ceased
immediately; Mirah, who had been playing the accompaniment,
involuntarily started up and turned round, the crackling sound, after
the occasional trick of sounds, having seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) something
thunderous; and Mab said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O-o-o, Hans! why do you bring a more horrible noise than my singing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth is the wonderful news?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick, who was the
only other person in the room. <div class="bookquote">``Anything about Italy--anything about
the Austrians giving up Venice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing about Italy, but something from Italy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, with a
peculiarity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) tone and manner which set his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) mother interpreting.
Imagine how some of us feel and behave when an event, not disagreeable
seems to be confirming and carrying out our private constructions. We
say, <div class="bookquote">``What do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>some person</b></font>)</div>in a pregnant tone to some innocent person
who has not embarked his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) wisdom in the same boat with ours, and finds
our information flat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing bad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Meyrick/Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Meyrick anxiously, thinking immediately of
Deronda; and Mirah's heart had been already clutched by the same
thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not bad for anybody we care much about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, quickly; <div class="bookquote">``rather
uncommonly lucky, I think. I never knew anybody die conveniently
before. Considering what a dear gazelle I am, I am constantly wondering
to find myself alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh me, Hans!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``if you must talk of yourself,
let it be behind your own back. What _is_ it that has happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Duke Alfonso is drowned, and the Duchess is alive, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said
Hans, putting the paper before Mrs. Meyrick, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) finger against a
paragraph. <div class="bookquote">``But more than all is--Deronda was at Genoa in the same
hotel with them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) brought in by the fishermen who had got
her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) out of the water time enough to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) from any harm. It seems
they saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) jump in after her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) husband, which was a less judicious
action than I should have expected of the Duchess. However Deronda is a
lucky fellow in being there to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah had sunk on the music stool again, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) eyelids down and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
hands tightly clasped; and Mrs. Meyrick, giving up the paper to Mab,
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor thing! she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) must have been fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) husband to jump in after
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was an inadvertence--a little absence of mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, creasing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) face roguishly, and throwing himself into a chair not far from
Mirah. <div class="bookquote">``Who can be fond of a jealous baritone, with freezing glances,
always singing asides?--that was the husband's _rôle_, depend upon it.
Nothing can be neater than his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) getting drowned. The Duchess is at
liberty now to marry a man with a fine head of hair, and glances that
will melt instead of freezing her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>). And I shall be invited to the
wedding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mirah started from her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) sitting posture, and fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) eyes on
Hans, with an angry gleam in them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) said, in a deeply-shaken voice
of indignation--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hans, you ought not to speak in that way. Mr. Deronda would not
like you to speak so. Why will you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) is lucky--why will you use
words of that sort about life and death--when what is life to one is
death to another? How do you know it would be lucky if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) loved Mrs.
Grandcourt? It might be a great evil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) away
from my brother--I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would. Mr. Deronda would not call that
lucky to pierce my brother's heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>All three were struck with the sudden transformation. Mirah's face,
with a look of anger that might have suited Ithuriel, pale, even to the
lips that were usually so rich of tint, was not far from poor Hans, who
sat transfixed, blushing under it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had been a girl, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
said, nervously--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a fool and a brute, and I withdraw every word. I'll go and hang
myself like Judas--if it's allowable to mention him (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Even in Hans's
sorrowful moments, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) improvised words had inevitably some drollery.

<p/>But Mirah's anger was not appeased: how could it be? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had burst into
indignant speech as creatures in intense pain bite and make their teeth
meet even through their own flesh, by way of making their agony
bearable. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said no more, but, seating herself at the piano, pressed
the sheet of music before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought of beginning to play
again.

<p/>It was Mab who spoke, while Mrs. Meyrick's face seemed to reflect some
of Hans' discomfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mirah is quite right to scold you, Hans. You are always taking Mr.
Deronda's name in vain. And it is horrible, joking in that way about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) marrying Mrs. Grandcourt. Men's minds must be very black, I think,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>ended Mab, with much scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite true, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, in a low tone, rising and turning on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) heel to walk toward the back window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had better go on, Mab; you have not given your full time to the
lesson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, in a higher tone than usual. <div class="bookquote">``Will you sing this
again, or shall I sing it to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please sing it to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, rejoiced to take no more notice
of what had happened.

<p/>And Mirah immediately sang _Lascia ch`io pianga_, giving forth its
melodious sobs and cries with new fullness and energy. Hans paused in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) walk and leaned against the mantel-piece, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) eyes
carefully away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) mother's. When Mirah had sung her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last note and
touched the last chord, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rose and said, <div class="bookquote">``I must go home now. Ezra
expects me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand silently to Mrs. Meyrick and hung back a little, not
daring to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), instead of kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), as usual. But the little
mother drew Mirah's face down to hers, and said, soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``God bless
you, my dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>Mirah felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had committed an offense against
Mrs. Meyrick by angrily rebuking Hans, and mixed with the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>)
suffering was the sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had shown something like a proud
ingratitude, an unbecoming assertion of superiority. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) friend had
divined this compunction.

<p/>Meanwhile Hans had seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) wide-awake, and was ready to open the
door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Hans,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mab</b></font>)</div>said Mab, with what was really a sister's tenderness
cunningly disguised, <div class="bookquote">``you are not going to walk home with Mirah. I am
sure she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would rather not. You are so dreadfully disagreeable to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does not forbid me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans,
opening the door.

<p/>Mirah said nothing, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had opened the outer door for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and
closed it behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) side unforbidden. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had not
the courage to begin speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) again--conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had
perhaps been unbecomingly severe in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) words to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>), yet finding only
severer words behind them in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) heart. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was pressed upon
by a crowd of thoughts thrusting themselves forward as interpreters of
that consciousness which still remained unaltered to herself.

<p/>Hans, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) side, had a mind equally busy. Mirah's anger had waked in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) a new perception, and with it the unpleasant sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was a
dolt not to have had it before. Suppose Mirah's heart were entirely
preoccupied with Deronda in another character than that of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own and
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother's benefactor; the supposition was attended in Hans's mind
with anxieties which, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) justice, were not altogether selfish.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had a strong persuasion, which only direct evidence to the contrary
could have dissipated, and that was that there was a serious attachment
between Deronda and Mrs. Grandcourt; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had pieced together many
fragments of observation, and gradually gathered knowledge, completed
by what his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sisters had heard from Anna Gascoigne, which convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
not only that Mrs. Grandcourt had a passion for Deronda, but also,
notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) friend's austere self-repression, that Deronda's
susceptibility about her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was the sign of concealed love. Some men,
having such a conviction, would have avoided allusions that could have
roused that susceptibility; but Hans's talk naturally fluttered toward
mischief, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was given to a form of experiment on live animals
which consisted in irritating his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) friends playfully. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) experiments
had ended in satisfying him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) thought likely was true.

<p/>On the other hand, any susceptibility Deronda had manifested about a
lover's attentions being shown to Mirah, Hans took to be sufficiently
accounted for by the alleged reason, namely, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) dependent position;
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) credited his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) friend with all possible unselfish anxiety for
those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) could rescue and protect. And Deronda's insistence that
Mirah would never marry one who was not a Jew necessarily seemed to
exclude himself, since Hans shared the ordinary opinion, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) knew
nothing to disturb, that Deronda was the son of Sir Hugo Mallinger.

<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt himself in clearness about the state of Deronda's
affections; but now, the events which really struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as concurring
toward the desirable union with Mrs. Grandcourt, had called forth a
flash of revelation from Mirah--a betrayal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) passionate feeling on
this subject which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) melancholy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) account as well as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own--yet on the whole less melancholy than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had imagined
Deronda's hopes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). It is not sublime, but it is common, for
a man to see the beloved object unhappy because his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rival loves
another, with more fortitude and a milder jealousy than if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
entirely happy in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rival. At least it was so with the mercurial
Hans, who fluctuated between the contradictory states of feeling,
wounded because Mirah was wounded, and of being almost obliged to
Deronda for loving somebody else. It was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to give
Mirah any direct sign of the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) anger,
yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) longed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) speechless companionship should be eloquent in a
tender, penitent sympathy which is an admissible form of wooing a
bruised heart.

<p/>Thus the two went side by side in a companionship that yet seemed an
agitated communication, like that of two chords whose quick vibrations
lie outside our hearing. But when they reached the door of Mirah's
home, and Hans said <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) hand with an appealing
look of penitence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) met the look with melancholy gentleness, and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Will you not come in and see my brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Hans could not but interpret this invitation as a sign of pardon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
had not enough understanding of what Mirah's nature had been wrought
into by her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) early experience, to divine how the very strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
late excitement had made it pass more quickly into the resolute
acceptance of pain. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``If you will let me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and they
went in together, half his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) grief was gone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was spinning a little
romance of how his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) devotion might make him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) indispensable to Mirah in
proportion as Deronda gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) devotion elsewhere. This was quite fair,
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) friend was provided for according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own heart; and on
the question of Judaism Hans felt thoroughly fortified:--who ever heard
in tale or history that a woman's love went in the track of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) race
and religion? Moslem and Jewish damsels were always attracted toward
Christians, and now if Mirah's heart had gone forth too precipitately
toward Deronda, here was another case in point. Hans was wont to make
merry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) own arguments, to call himself a Giaour, and antithesis
the sole clue to events; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) believed a little in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) laughed
at. And thus his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) bird-like hope, constructed on the lightest
principles, soared again in spite of heavy circumstances.

<p/>They found Mordecai looking singularly happy, holding a closed letter
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) eyes glowing with a quiet triumph which in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
emaciated face gave the idea of a conquest over assailing death. After
the greeting between him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) and Hans, Mirah put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
brother's neck and looked down at the letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) hand, without the
courage to ask about it, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) felt sure that it was the cause of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A letter from Daniel Deronda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) look.
<div class="bookquote">``Brief--only saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hopes soon to return. Unexpected claims
have detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). The promise of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) again is like the bow in
the cloud to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>continued Mordecai, looking at Hans; <div class="bookquote">``and to you it
must be a gladness. For who has two friends like him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>While Hans was answering Mirah slipped away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own room; but not to
indulge in any outburst of the passion within her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). If the angels, once
supposed to watch the toilet of women, had entered the little chamber
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) shut the door behind them, they would only have
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) take off her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hat, sit down and press her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hands against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
temples as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had suddenly reflected that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) head ached; then rise
to dash cold water on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) eyes and brow and hair till her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) backward
curls were full of crystal beads, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) brow and
looked out like a freshly-opened flower from among the dewy tresses of
the woodland; then give deep sighs of relief, and putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) little
slippers, sit still after that action for a couple of minutes, which
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) so long, so full of things to come, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) rose with an
air of recollection, and went down to make tea.

<p/>Something of the old life had returned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had been used to remember
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) must learn her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) part, must go to rehearsal, must act and sing
in the evening, must hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) feelings from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) father; and the more
painful her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) life grew, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had been used to hide. The force of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) nature had long found its chief action in resolute endurance, and
to-day the violence of feeling which had caused the first jet of anger
had quickly transformed itself into a steady facing of trouble, the
well-known companion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) young years. But while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) moved about and
spoke as usual, a close observer might have discerned a difference
between this apparent calm, which was the effect of restraining energy,
and the sweet genuine calm of the months when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) first felt a return
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) infantine happiness.

<p/>Those who have been indulged by fortune and have always thought of
calamity as what happens to others, feel a blind incredulous rage at
the reversal of their lot, and half believe that their wild cries will
alter the course of the storm. Mirah felt no such surprise when
familiar Sorrow came back from brief absence, and sat down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
according to the old use and wont. And this habit of expecting trouble
rather than joy, hindered her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) from having any persistent belief in
opposition to the probabilities which were not merely suggested by
Hans, but were supported by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own private knowledge and long-growing
presentiment. An attachment between Deronda and Mrs. Grandcourt, to end
in their future marriage, had the aspect of a certainty for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
feeling. There had been no fault in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>): facts had ordered themselves
so that there was a tie between him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and this woman who belonged to
another world than hers and Ezra's--nay, who seemed another sort of
being than Deronda, something foreign that would be a disturbance in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life instead of blending with it. Well, well--but if it could have
been deferred so as to make no difference while Ezra was there! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did
not know all the momentousness of the relation between Deronda and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
brother, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen, and instinctively felt enough to forebode
its being incongruous with any close tie to Mrs. Grandcourt; at least
this was the clothing that Mirah first gave to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mortal repugnance.
But in the still, quick action of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) consciousness, thoughts went on
like changing states of sensation unbroken by her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) habitual acts; and
this inward language soon said distinctly that the mortal repugnance
would remain even if Ezra were secured from loss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I have read about and sung about and seen acted, is happening to
me--this that I am feeling is the love that makes jealousy;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>so
impartially Mirah summed up the charge against herself. But what
difference could this pain of hers make to any one else? It must remain
as exclusively her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) own, and hidden, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) early yearning and devotion
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) lost mother. But unlike that devotion, it was something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
felt to be a misfortune of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) nature--a discovery that what should
have been pure gratitude and reverence had sunk into selfish pain, that
the feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) had hitherto delighted to pour out in words was
degraded into something she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was ashamed to betray--an absurd longing
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) who had received all and given nothing should be of importance
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was of no importance--an angry feeling toward another woman
who possessed the good she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted. But what notion, what vain reliance
could it be that had lain darkly within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and was now burning itself
into sight as disappointment and jealousy? It was as if her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul had
been steeped in poisonous passion by forgotten dreams of deep sleep,
and now flamed out in this unaccountable misery. For with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waking
reason she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never entertained what seemed the wildly unfitting
thought that Deronda could love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The uneasiness she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had felt before
had been comparatively vague and easily explained as part of a general
regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was only a visitant in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother's world, from
which the world where his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) home lay was as different as a portico with
lights and lacqueys was different from the door of a tent, where the
only splendor came from the mysterious inaccessible stars. But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
feeling was no longer vague: the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pain--the image of Mrs.
Grandcourt by Deronda's side, drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) farther and farther into the
distance, was as definite as pincers on her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) flesh. In the Psyche-mould
of Mirah's frame there rested a fervid quality of emotion, sometimes
rashly supposed to require the bulk of a Cleopatra; her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) impressions had
the thoroughness and tenacity that give to the first selection of
passionate feeling the character of a lifelong faithfulness. And now a
selection had declared itself, which gave love a cruel heart of
jealousy: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) had been used to a strong repugnance toward certain
objects that surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>), and to walk inwardly aloof from them while
they touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) sense. And now her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) repugnance concentrated itself on
Mrs. Grandcourt, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) involuntarily conceived more evil than she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
knew. <div class="bookquote">``I could bear everything that used to be--but this is worse--this
is worse,--I used not to have horrible feelings!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the poor child
in a loud whisper to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) pillow. Strange that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) should have to pray
against any feeling which concerned Deronda!

<p/>But this conclusion had been reached through an evening spent in
attending to Mordecai, whose exaltation of spirit in the prospect of
seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) friend again, disposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) to utter many thoughts aloud to
Mirah, though such communication was often interrupted by intervals
apparently filled with an inward utterance that animated his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) eyes and
gave an occasional silent action to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) lips. One thought especially
occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seest thou, Mirah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) said once, after a long silence, ``the _Shemah_,
wherein we briefly confess the divine Unity, is the chief devotional
exercise of the Hebrew; and this made our religion the fundamental
religion for the whole world; for the divine Unity embraced as its
consequence the ultimate unity of mankind. See, then--the nation which
has been scoffed at for its separateness, has given a binding theory to
the human race. Now, in complete unity a part possesses the whole as
the whole possesses every part: and in this way human life is tending
toward the image of the Supreme Unity: for as our life becomes more
spiritual by capacity of thought, and joy therein, possession tends to
become more universal, being independent of gross material contact; so
that in a brief day the soul of man may know in fuller volume the good
which has been and is, nay, is to come, than all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could possess in a
whole life where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to follow the creeping paths of the senses. In
this moment, my sister, I hold the joy of another's future within me: a
future which these eyes will not see, and which my spirit may not then
recognize as mine. I recognize it now, and love it so, that I can lay
down this poor life upon its altar and say: ``Burn, burn indiscernibly
into that which shall be, which is my love and not me.<div class="bookquote">'' Dost thou
understand, Mirah?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, faintly, <div class="bookquote">``but my mind is too poor to have felt
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, rather insistently, <div class="bookquote">``women are specially
framed for the love which feels possession in renouncing, and is thus a
fit image of what I mean. Somewhere in the later _Midrash_, I think, is
the story of a Jewish maiden who loved a Gentile king so well, that
this was what she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) did:--she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) entered into prison and changed clothes
with the woman who was beloved by the king, that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) might deliver that
woman from death by dying in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) stead, and leave the king to be happy
in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) love which was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). This is the surpassing love, that
loses self in the object of love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Ezra, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, with low-toned intensity, <div class="bookquote">``that was not it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) wanted the king when she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was dead to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had done, and
feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was better than the other. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) strong self,
wanting to conquer, that made her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai was silent a little, and then argued--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That might be, Mirah. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) acted so, believing the king would
never know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can make the story so in your mind, Ezra, because you are great,
and like to fancy the greatest that could be. But I think it was not
really like that. The Jewish girl must have had jealousy in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted somehow to have the first place in the king's mind. That
is what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would die for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister, thou hast read too many plays, where the writers delight in

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah made no answer.




<p/>CHAPTER LXII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Das Gluck ist eine leichte Dirne,
Und weilt nicht gern am selben Ort;
Sie streicht das Haar dir von der Stirn
Und kusst dich rasch und flattert fort

<p/>Frau Ungluck hat im Gegentheile
Dich liebefest an's Herz gedruckt;
Sie sagt, sie habe keine Eile,
Setzt sich zu dir ans Bett und strickt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--HEINE.


<p/>Something which Mirah had lately been watching for as the fulfilment of
a threat, seemed now the continued visit of that familiar sorrow which
had lately come back, bringing abundant luggage.

<p/>Turning out of Knightsbridge, after singing at a charitable morning
concert in a wealthy house, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had been recommended by Klesmer,
and where there had been the usual groups outside to see the departing
company, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) began to feel herself dogged by footsteps that kept an
even pace with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) concert dress being simple black, over
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had thrown a dust cloak, could not make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) an object of
unpleasant attention, and render walking an imprudence; but this
reflection did not occur to Mirah: another kind of alarm lay uppermost
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) immediately thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) father, and could no more
look round than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had felt herself tracked by a ghost. To turn and
face him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be voluntarily to meet the rush of emotions which
beforehand seemed intolerable. If it were her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) father he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must mean to
claim recognition, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) to face him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) must wait
for that compulsion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) walked on, not quickening her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) pace--of what
use was that?--but picturing what was about to happen as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had the
full certainty that the man behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) father; and along with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) picturing went a regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) word to Mrs. Meyrick
not to use any concealment about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The regret at last urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), at
least, to try and hinder any sudden betrayal that would cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
brother an unnecessary shock. Under the pressure of this motive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
resolved to turn before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own door, and firmly will the
encounter instead of merely submitting to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had already reached
the entrance of the small square where her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) home lay, and had made up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) mind to turn, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) embodied presentiment getting
closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), then slipping to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) side, grasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) wrist, and
saying, with a persuasive curl of accent, <div class="bookquote">``Mirah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) paused at once without any start; it was the voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) expected,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was meeting the expected eyes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) face was as grave as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
had been looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) executioner, while his (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) was adjusted to the
intention of soothing and propitiating her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). Once a handsome face, with
bright color, it was now sallow and deep-lined, and had that peculiar
impress of impudent suavity which comes from courting favor while
accepting disrespect. He (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) was lightly made and active, with something of
youth about him (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) which made the signs of age seem a disguise; and in
reality he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) was hardly fifty-seven. His (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) dress was shabby, as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) before. The presence of this unreverend father now, more
than ever, affected Mirah with the mingled anguish of shame and grief,
repulsion and pity--more than ever, now that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own world was changed
into one where there was no comradeship to fence him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from scorn and
contempt.

<p/>Slowly, with a sad, tremulous voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It is you, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you run away from me, child?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began with rapid speech which
was meant to have a tone of tender remonstrance, accompanied with
various quick gestures like an abbreviated finger-language. <div class="bookquote">``What were
you afraid of? You knew I never made you do anything against your will.
It was for your sake I broke up your engagement in the Vorstadt,
because I saw it didn't suit you, and you repaid me by leaving me to
the bad times that came in consequence. I had made an easier engagement
for you at the Vorstadt Theater in Dresden: I didn't tell you, because
I wanted to take you by surprise. And you left me planted
there--obliged to make myself scarce because I had broken contract.
That was hard lines for me, after I had given up everything for the
sake of getting you an education which was to be a fortune to you. What
father devoted himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter more than I did to you? You know
how I bore that disappointment in your voice, and made the best of it:
and when I had nobody besides you, and was getting broken, as a man
must who has had to fight his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brains--you chose that time
to leave me. Who else was it you owed everything to, if not to me? and
where was your feeling in return? For what my daughter cared, I might
have died in a ditch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lapidoth/Miss Lapidoth</b></font>)</div><p/>Lapidoth stopped short here, not from lack of invention, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had reached a pathetic climax, and gave a sudden sob, like a woman's,
taking out hastily an old yellow silk handkerchief. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) really felt that
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ill--a sort of sensibility which is
naturally strong in unscrupulous persons, who put down what is owing to
them, without any _per contra_. Mirah, in spite of that sob, had energy
enough not to let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) answered more
firmly, though it was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had ever used accusing words
to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know why I left you, father; and I had reason to distrust you,
because I felt sure that you had deceived my mother. If I could have
trusted you, I would have stayed with you and worked for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never meant to deceive your mother, Mirah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lapidoth/Miss Lapidoth</b></font>)</div>said Lapidoth, putting
back his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) handkerchief, but beginning with a voice that seemed to
struggle against further sobbing. <div class="bookquote">``I meant to take you back to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but
chances hindered me just at the time, and then there came information
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death. It was better for you that I should stay where I was, and
your brother could take care of himself. Nobody had any claim on me but
you. I had word of your mother's death from a particular friend, who
had undertaken to manage things for me, and I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) over money to
pay expenses. There's one chance to be sure--''  (<font color='red'><b>Lapidoth/Miss Lapidoth</b></font>)</div>Lapidoth had quickly
conceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must guard against something unlikely, yet
possible--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) may have written me lies for the sake of getting the
money out of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah made no answer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) could not bear to utter the only true one--<div class="bookquote">``I
don't believe one word of what you say'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) simply showed a wish
that they should walk on, feeling that their standing still might draw
down unpleasant notice. Even as they walked along, their companionship
might well have made a passer-by turn back to look at them. The figure
of Mirah, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) beauty set off by the quiet, careful dress of an
English lady, made a strange pendant to this shabby, foreign-looking,
eager, and gesticulating man, who withal had an ineffaceable jauntiness
of air, perhaps due to the bushy curls of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grizzled hair, the
smallness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and feet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) light walk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to have done well for yourself, Mirah? _You_ are in no want,
I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) with emphatic examination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good friends who found me in distress have helped me to get work,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, hardly knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) actually said, from being occupied
with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) would presently have to say. <div class="bookquote">``I give lessons. I have sung
in private houses. I have just been singing at a private concert.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
paused, and then added, with significance, <div class="bookquote">``I have very good friends,
who know all about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you would be ashamed they should see your father in this plight?
No wonder. I came to England with no prospect, but the chance of
finding you. It was a mad quest; but a father's heart is
superstitious--feels a loadstone drawing it somewhere or other. I might
have done very well, staying abroad: when I hadn't you to take care of,
I could have rolled or settled as easily as a ball; but it's hard being
lonely in the world, when your spirit's beginning to break. And I
thought my little Mirah would repent leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) father when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came
to look back. I've had a sharp pinch to work my way; I don't know what
I shall come down to next. Talents like mine are no use in this
country. When a man's getting out at elbows nobody will believe in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
I couldn't get any decent employ with my appearance. I've been obliged
to get pretty low for a shilling already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah's anxiety was quick enough to imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) father's sinking into a
further degradation, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) was bound to hinder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) could. But
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) could answer his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) string of inventive sentences, delivered
with as much glibness as if they had been learned by rote, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added
promptly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you live, Mirah?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, in this square. We are not far from the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In lodgings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any one to take care of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah again, looking full at the keen face which was turned
toward hers--<div class="bookquote">``my brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>The father's eyelids fluttered as if the lightning had come across
them, and there was a slight movement of the shoulders. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said,
after a just perceptible pause: <div class="bookquote">``Ezra? How did you know--how did you
find him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would take long to tell. Here we are at the door. My brother
would not wish me to close it on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah was already on the doorstep, but had her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) face turned toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
father, who stood below her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) on the pavement. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) heart had begun to
beat faster with the prospect of what was coming in the presence of
Ezra; and already in this attitude of giving leave to the father whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) had been used to obey--in this sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) standing below her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>),
with a perceptible shrinking from the admission which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been
indirectly asking for, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) had a pang of the peculiar, sympathetic
humiliation and shame--the stabbed heart of reverence--which belongs to
a nature intensely filial.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay a minute, _Liebchen_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lapidoth/Miss Lapidoth</b></font>)</div>said Lapidoth, speaking in a lowered tone;
<div class="bookquote">``what sort of man has Ezra turned out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lapidoth/Miss Lapidoth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good man--a wonderful man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, with slow emphasis, trying
to master the agitation which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) voice more tremulous as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) went
on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) felt urged to prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) father for the complete penetration
of himself which awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very poor when my friends
found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for me--a poor workman. Once--twelve years ago--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was strong
and happy, going to the East, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved to think of; and my mother
called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back because--because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had lost me. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
and took care of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) through great trouble, and worked for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
died--died in grief. And Ezra, too, had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) health and strength.
The cold had seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) coming back to my mother, because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
forsaken. For years he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) has been getting weaker--always poor, always
working--but full of knowledge, and great-minded. All who come near him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
honor him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>). To stand before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) is like standing before a prophet of

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) had cast down her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) eyes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) might not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) father while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
spoke the last words--unable to bear the ignoble look of frustration
that gathered in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was none the less quick in invention
and decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mirah, _Liebchen_,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, in the old caressing way, <div class="bookquote">``shouldn't you
like me to make myself a little more respectable before my son sees me?
If I had a little sum of money, I could fit myself out and come home to
you as your father ought, and then I could offer myself for some decent
place. With a good shirt and coat on my back, people would be glad
enough to have me. I could offer myself for a courier, if I didn't look
like a broken-down mountebank. I should like to be with my children,
and forget and forgive. But you have never seen your father look like
this before. If you had ten pounds at hand--or I could appoint you to
bring it me somewhere--I could fit myself out by the day after
to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah felt herself under a temptation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) must try to overcome.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) answered, obliging herself to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like to deny you what you ask, father; but I have given a
promise not to do things for you in secret. It _is_ hard to see you
looking needy; but we will bear that for a little while; and then you
can have new clothes, and we can pay for them.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) practical sense
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) see now what was Mrs. Meyrick's wisdom in exacting a promise
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>).

<p/>Lapidoth's good humor gave way a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, with a sneer, <div class="bookquote">``You
are a hard and fast young lady--you have been learning useful
virtues--keeping promises not to help your father with a pound or two
when you are getting money to dress yourself in silk--your father who
made an idol of you, and gave up the best part of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life to providing
for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems cruel--I know it seems cruel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, feeling this a
worse moment than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) meant to drown herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) lips were
suddenly pale. <div class="bookquote">``But, father, it is more cruel to break the promises
people trust in. That broke my mother's heart--it has broken Ezra's
life. You and I must eat now this bitterness from what has been. Bear
it. Bear to come in and be cared for as you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lapidoth/Miss Lapidoth</b></font>)</div>said Lapidoth, almost turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heel away from
this pale, trembling daughter, who seemed now to have got the
inconvenient world to back her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quickly turned on it again, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands feeling about restlessly in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pockets, and said, with some
return to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) appealing tone, <div class="bookquote">``I'm a little cut up with all this,
Mirah. I shall get up my spirits by to-morrow. If you've a little money
in your pocket, I suppose it isn't against your promise to give me a
trifle--to buy a cigar with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah could not ask herself another question--could not do anything
else than put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) cold trembling hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) pocket for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
_portemonnaie_ and hold it out. Lapidoth grasped it at once, pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) fingers the while, said, <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, my little girl--to-morrow
then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lapidoth/Miss Lapidoth</b></font>)</div>and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not taken many steps before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked
carefully into all the folds of the purse, found two half-sovereigns
and odd silver, and, pasted against the folding cover, a bit of paper
on which Ezra had inscribed, in a beautiful Hebrew character, the name
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) mother, the days of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) birth, marriage, and death, and the
prayer, <div class="bookquote">``May Mirah be delivered from evil.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>It was Mirah's liking to
have this little inscription on many articles that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used. The father
read it, and had a quick vision of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marriage day, and the bright,
unblamed young fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was at that time; teaching many things, but
expecting by-and-by to get money more easily by writing; and very fond
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) beautiful bride Sara--crying when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) expected him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to cry, and
reflecting every phase of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) feeling with mimetic susceptibility.
Lapidoth had traveled a long way from that young self, and thought of
all that this inscription signified with an unemotional memory, which
was like the ocular perception of a touch to one who has lost the sense
of touch, or like morsels on an untasting palate, having shape and
grain, but no flavor. Among the things we may gamble away in a lazy
selfish life is the capacity for ruth, compunction, or any unselfish
regret--which we may come to long for as one in slow death longs to
feel laceration, rather than be conscious of a widening margin where
consciousness once was. Mirah's purse was a handsome one--a gift to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>), which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) had been unable to reflect about giving away--and
Lapidoth presently found himself outside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) reverie, considering
what the purse would fetch in addition to the sum it contained, and
what prospect there was of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) being able to get more from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) daughter
without submitting to adopt a penitential form of life under the eyes
of that formidable son. On such a subject his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) susceptibilities were
still lively.

<p/>Meanwhile Mirah had entered the house with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) power of reticence
overcome by the cruelty of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brother quietly
reading and sifting old manuscripts of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own, which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) meant to
consign to Deronda. In the reaction from the long effort to master
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fell down before him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knees, sobbing, and
crying, <div class="bookquote">``Ezra, Ezra!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not speak. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) alarm for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) spending itself on conceiving the
cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) distress, the more striking from the novelty in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) of
this violent manifestation. But Mirah's own longing was to be able to
speak and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) the cause. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand, and still
sobbing, said brokenly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ezra, my father! our father! He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) followed me. I wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) to come in.
I said you would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) come in. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) said No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) would not--not
now, but to-morrow. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) begged for money from me. And I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) my
purse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) went away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah's words seemed to herself to express all the misery she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) felt in
them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brother found them less grievous than his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) preconceptions, and
said gently, <div class="bookquote">``Wait for calm, Mirah, and then tell me all,'' (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>--putting off
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hat and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hands tenderly on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) felt the
soothing influence, and in a few minutes told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
could all that had happened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) will not come to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai. Neither of them said to
the other what they both thought, namely, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) might watch for
Mirah's outgoings and beg from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seest thou,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) presently added, <div class="bookquote">``our lot is the lot of Israel. The
grief and the glory are mingled as the smoke and the flame. It is
because we children have inherited the good that we feel the evil.
These things are wedded for us, as our father was wedded to our mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The surroundings were of Brompton, but the voice might have come from a
Rabbi transmitting the sentences of an elder time to be registered in
_Babli_--by which -LRB-to our ears-RRB- affectionate-sounding diminutive is
meant the voluminous Babylonian Talmud. <div class="bookquote">``The Omnipresent,''  (<font color='red'><b>a Rabbi</b></font>)</div>said a
Rabbi, <div class="bookquote">``is occupied in making marriages.''  (<font color='red'><b>a Rabbi</b></font>)</div>The levity of the saying lies
in the ear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>) who hears it; for by marriages the speaker meant all
the wondrous combinations of the universe whose issue makes our good
and evil.




<p/>CHAPTER LXIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Moses, trotz seiner Bafeindung der Kunst, dennoch selber ein grosser
Künstler war und den wahren Künstlergeist besass. Nur war dieser
Künstlergeist bei ihm, wie bei seinen ägyptischen Landsleuteu, nurauf
das Colossale und Unverwustliche gerichtet. Aber nicht vie die
Aegypter formirte er seine Kunstwerke aus Backstem und Granit, sondern
er baute Menchen-pyramiden, er meisselte Menschen Obelisken, ernahm

_Gestandnisse_.


<p/>Imagine the difference in Deronda's state of mind when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) left England
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) returned to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had set out for Genoa in total
uncertainty how far the actual bent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wishes and affections would
be encouraged--how far the claims revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) into
new paths, far away from the tracks his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thoughts had lately been
pursuing with a consent of desire which uncertainty made dangerous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
came back with something like a discovered charter warranting the
inherited right that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ambition had begun to yearn for: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) came back
with what was better than freedom--with a duteous bond which his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
experience had been preparing him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to accept gladly, even if it had been
attended with no promise of satisfying a secret passionate longing
never yet allowed to grow into a hope. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) dared avow to himself
the hidden selection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) love. Since the hour when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) left the house
at Chelsea in full-hearted silence under the effect of Mirah's farewell
look and words--their exquisite appealingness stirring in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) that
deep-laid care for womanhood which had begun when his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own lip was like
a girl's--her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) feeling had helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to be blameless in
word and deed under the difficult circumstances we know of. There
seemed no likelihood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could ever woo this creature who had
become dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) amidst associations that forbade wooing; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
taken her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) soul as a beloved type--reducing the power of
other fascination and making a difference in it that became deficiency.
The influence had been continually strengthened. It had lain in the
course of poor Gwendolen's lot that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dependence on Deronda tended to
rouse in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) the enthusiasm of self-martyring pity rather than of
personal love, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) less constrained tenderness flowed with the
fuller stream toward an indwelling image in all things unlike
Gwendolen. Still more, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) relation to Mordecai had brought with it a
new nearness to Mirah which was not the less agitating because there
was no apparent change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) position toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
inevitably been bound up in all the thoughts that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) shrink from
an issue disappointing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brother. This process had not gone on
unconsciously in Deronda: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was conscious of it as we are of some
covetousness that it would be better to nullify by encouraging other
thoughts than to give it the insistency of confession even to
ourselves: but the jealous fire had leaped out at Hans's pretensions,
and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) mother accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) of being in love with a Jewess any
evasion suddenly seemed an infidelity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) mother had compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) to
a decisive acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) love, as Joseph Kalonymos had
compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) to a definite expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) resolve. This new state
of decision wrought on Deronda with a force which surprised even
himself. There was a release of all the energy which had long been
spent in self-checking and suppression because of doubtful conditions;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was ready to laugh at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) own impetuosity when, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) neared
England on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) way from Mainz, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) felt the remaining distance more and
more of an obstruction. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had found an added soul in
finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) ancestry--his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) judgment no longer wandering in the mazes of
impartial sympathy, but choosing, with that partiality which is man's
best strength, the closer fellowship that makes sympathy
practical--exchanging that bird's eye reasonableness which soars to
avoid preference and loses all sense of quality for the generous
reasonableness of drawing shoulder to shoulder with men of like
inheritance. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted now to be again with Mordecai, to pour forth
instead of restraining his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) feeling, to admit agreement and maintain
dissent, and all the while to find Mirah's presence without the
embarrassment of obviously seeking it, to see her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the light of a new
possibility, to interpret her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks and words from a new
starting-point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) was not greatly alarmed about the effect of Hans's
attentions, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had a presentiment that her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feeling toward himself
had from the first lain in a channel from which it was not likely to be
diverted into love. To astonish a woman by turning into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover when
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been thinking of you merely as a Lord Chancellor is what a man
naturally shrinks from: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is anxious to create an easier transition.

<p/>What wonder that Deronda saw no other course than to go straight from
the London railway station to the lodgings in that small square in
Brompton? Every argument was in favor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) losing no time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had
promised to run down the next day to see Lady Mallinger at the Abbey,
and it was already sunset. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wished to deposit the precious chest with
Mordecai, who would study its contents, both in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) absence and in
company with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>); and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should pay this visit without pause would
gratify Mordecai's heart. Hence, and for other reasons, it gratified
Deronda's heart. The strongest tendencies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) nature were rushing in
one current--the fervent affectionateness which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) delight in
meeting the wish of beings near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and the imaginative need of
some far-reaching relation to make the horizon of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) immediate, daily
acts. It has to be admitted that in this classical, romantic,
world-historic position of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), bringing as it were from its
hiding-place his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hereditary armor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) wore--but so, one must suppose,
did the most ancient heroes, whether Semitic or Japhetic--the summer
costume of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) contemporaries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) did not reflect that the drab tints
were becoming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rarely went to the expense of such
thinking; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own depth of coloring, which made the becomingness,
got an added radiance in the eyes, a fleeting and returning glow in the
skin, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) entered the house wondering what exactly he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should find. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) entrance as noiseless as possible.

<p/>It was the evening of that same afternoon on which Mirah had had the
interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) father. Mordecai, penetrated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) grief, and also
the sad memories which the incident had awakened, had not resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
task of sifting papers: some of them had fallen scattered on the floor
in the first moments of anxiety, and neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) nor Mirah had thought
of laying them in order again. They had sat perfectly still together,
not knowing how long; while the clock ticked on the mantelpiece, and
the light was fading, Mirah, unable to think of the food that she (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ought
to have been taking, had not moved since she (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had thrown off her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
dust-cloak and sat down beside Mordecai with her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) head backward, with closed eyes and difficult breathing,
looking, Mirah thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) would look when the soul within him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) could
no longer live in its straitened home. The thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) death might
be near was continually visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) face in this way,
without its vivid animation; and now, to the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) grief, was
added the regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been unable to control the violent
outburst which had shaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sat watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)--her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) oval cheeks
pallid, her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes with the sorrowful brilliancy left by young tears, her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
curls in as much disorder as a just-awakened child's--watching that
emaciated face, where it might have been imagined that a veil had been
drawn never to be lifted, as if it were her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) dead joy which had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
strong enough to live on in sorrow. And life at that moment stretched
before Mirah with more than a repetition of former sadness. The shadow
of the father was there, and more than that, a double bereavement--of
one living as well as one dead.

<p/>But now the door was opened, and while none entered, a well-known voice
said: <div class="bookquote">``Daniel Deronda--may he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) come in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come! come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, immediately rising with an irradiated face
and opened eyes--apparently as little surprised as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had seen
Deronda in the morning, and expected this evening visit; while Mirah
started up blushing with confused, half-alarmed expectation.

<p/>Yet when Deronda entered, the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was like the clearness after
rain: no clouds to come could hinder the cherishing beam of that
moment. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) right hand to Mirah, who was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
brother's left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) other hand on Mordecai's right shoulder,
and stood so a moment, holding them both at once, uttering no word, but
reading their faces, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said anxiously to Mirah, <div class="bookquote">``Has anything
happened?--any trouble?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Talk not of trouble now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai, saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) from the need to
answer. <div class="bookquote">``There is joy in your face--let the joy be ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah thought, <div class="bookquote">``It is for something he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) cannot tell us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>But they all
sat down, Deronda drawing a chair close in front of Mordecai.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) said, emphatically. <div class="bookquote">``I have a joy which will remain
to us even in the worst trouble. I did not tell you the reason of my
journey abroad, Mordecai, because--never mind--I went to learn my
parentage. And you were right. I am a Jew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men hands</b></font>)</div><p/>The two men clasped hands with a movement that seemed part of the flash
from Mordecai's eyes, and passed through Mirah like an electric shock.
But Deronda went on without pause, speaking from Mordecai's mind as
much as from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have the same people. Our souls have the same vocation. We shall
not be separated by life or by death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Mordecai's answer was uttered in Hebrew, and in no more than a loud
whisper. It was in the liturgical words which express the religious
bond: <div class="bookquote">``Our God and the God of our fathers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The weight of feeling pressed too strongly on that ready-winged speech
which usually moved in quick adaptation to every stirring of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) fervor.

<p/>Mirah fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) knees by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) brother's side, and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) now
illuminated face, which had just before been so deathly. The action was
an inevitable outlet of the violent reversal from despondency to a
gladness which came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) as solemnly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had been beholding a
religious rite. For the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) thought of the effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own
life only through the effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it is not only that I am a Jew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda went on, enjoying one of
those rare moments when our yearnings and our acts can be completely
one, and the real we behold is our ideal good; <div class="bookquote">``but I come of a strain
that has ardently maintained the fellowship of our race--a line of
Spanish Jews that has borne many students and men of practical power.
And I possess what will give us a sort of communion with them. My
grandfather, Daniel Charisi, preserved manuscripts, family records
stretching far back, in the hope that they would pass into the hands of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>) grandson. And now his (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>) hope is fulfilled, in spite of attempts to
thwart it by hiding my parentage from me. I possess the chest
containing them, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charisi</b></font>) own papers, and it is down below in this
house. I mean to leave it with you, Mordecai, that you may help me to
study the manuscripts. Some of them I can read easily enough--those in
Spanish and Italian. Others are in Hebrew, and, I think, Arabic; but
there seem to be Latin translations. I was only able to look at them
cursorily while I stayed at Mainz. We will study them together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda ended with that bright smile which, beaming out from the
habitual gravity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face, seemed a revelation -LRB-the reverse of the
continual smile that discredits all expression-RRB-. But when this happy
glance passed from Mordecai to rest on Mirah, it acted like a little
too much sunshine, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) change her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) attitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had knelt
under an impulse with which any personal embarrassment was incongruous,
and especially any thoughts about how Mrs. Grandcourt might stand to
this new aspect of things--thoughts which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) color under
Deronda's glance, and rise to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) seat again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) usual posture
of crossed hands and feet, with the effort to look as quiet as
possible. Deronda, equally sensitive, imagined that the feeling of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was conscious, had entered too much into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes, and had
been repugnant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was ready enough to believe that any
unexpected manifestation might spoil her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) feeling toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)--and then
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) precious relation to brother and sister would be marred. If Mirah
could have no love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), any advances of love on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) part would make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) wretched in that continual contact with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) which would remain
inevitable.

<p/>While such feelings were pulsating quickly in Deronda and Mirah,
Mordecai, seeing nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) friend's presence and words but a
blessed fulfillment, was already speaking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) old sense of
enlargement in utterance--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Daniel, from the first, I have said to you, we know not all the
pathways. Has there not been a meeting among them, as of the operations
in one soul, where an idea being born and breathing draws the elements
toward it, and is fed and glows? For all things are bound together in
that Omnipresence which is the place and habitation of the world, and
events are of a glass wherethrough our eyes see some of the pathways.
And if it seems that the erring and unloving wills of men have helped
to prepare you, as Moses was prepared, to serve your people the better,
that depends on another order than the law which must guide our
footsteps. For the evil will of man makes not a people's good except by
stirring the righteous will of man; and beneath all the clouds with
which our thought encompasses the Eternal, this is clear--that a people
can be blessed only by having counsellors and a multitude whose will
moves in obedience to the laws of justice and love. For see, now, it
was your loving will that made a chief pathway, and resisted the effect
of evil; for, by performing the duties of brotherhood to my sister, and
seeking out her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother in the flesh, your soul has been prepared to
receive with gladness this message of the Eternal, `behold the
multitude of your brethren.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite true that you and Mirah have been my teachers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda. ``If this revelation had been made to me before I knew you
both, I think my mind would have rebelled against it. Perhaps I should
have felt then--``If I could have chosen, I would not have been a Jew.<div class="bookquote">''
What I feel now is--that my whole being is a consent to the fact. But
it has been the gradual accord between your mind and mine which has
brought about that full consent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>At the moment Deronda was speaking, that first evening in the book-shop
was vividly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) remembrance, with all the struggling aloofness he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
had then felt from Mordecai's prophetic confidence. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) nature
to delight in satisfying to the utmost the eagerly-expectant soul,
which seemed to be looking out from the face before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), like the
long-enduring watcher who at last sees the mountain signal-flame; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went on with fuller fervor--

<p/>``It is through your inspiration that I have discerned what may be my
life's task. It is you who have given shape to what, I believe, was an
inherited yearning--the effect of brooding, passionate thoughts in many
ancestors--thoughts that seem to have been intensely present in my
grandfather. Suppose the stolen offspring of some mountain tribe
brought up in a city of the plain, or one with an inherited genius for
painting, and born blind--the ancestral life would lie within them as a
dim longing for unknown objects and sensations, and the spell-bound
habit of their inherited frames would be like a cunningly-wrought
musical instrument, never played on, but quivering throughout in uneasy
mysterious meanings of its intricate structure that, under the right
touch, gives music. Something like that, I think, has been my
experience. Since I began to read and know, I have always longed for
some ideal task, in which I might feel myself the heart and brain of a
multitude--some social captainship, which would come to me as a duty,
and not be striven for as a personal prize. You have raised the image
of such a task for me--to bind our race together in spite of heresy.
You have said to me--``Our religion united us before it divided us--it
made us a people before it made Rabbanites and Karaites.<div class="bookquote">'' I mean to try
what can be done with that union--I mean to work in your spirit.
Failure will not be ignoble, but it would be ignoble for me not to try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Karaites</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even as my brother that fed at the breasts of my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said
Mordecai, falling back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) chair with a look of exultant repose, as
after some finished labor.

<p/>To estimate the effect of this ardent outpouring from Deronda we must
remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) former reserve, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) careful avoidance of premature assent
or delusive encouragement, which gave to this decided pledge of himself
a sacramental solemnity, both for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own mind and Mordecai's. On Mirah
the effect was equally strong, though with a difference: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) felt a
surprise which had no place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) brother's mind, at Deronda's
suddenly revealed sense of nearness to them: there seemed to be a
breaking of day around her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) which might show her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) other facts unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
forebodings in the darkness. But after a moment's silence Mordecai
spoke again--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has begun already--the marriage of our souls. It waits but the
passing away of this body, and then they who are betrothed shall unite
in a stricter bond, and what is mine shall be thine. Call nothing mine
that I have written, Daniel; for though our masters delivered rightly
that everything should be quoted in the name of him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) that said it--and
their rule is good--yet it does not exclude the willing marriage which
melts soul into soul, and makes thought fuller as the clear waters are
made fuller, where the fullness is inseparable and the clearness is
inseparable. For I have judged what I have written, and I desire the
body that I gave my thought to pass away as this fleshly body will
pass; but let the thought be born again from our fuller soul which
shall be called yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not ask me to promise that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I must
be convinced first of special reasons for it in the writings
themselves. And I am too backward a pupil yet. That blent transmission
must go on without any choice of ours; but what we can't hinder must
not make our rule for what we ought to choose. I think our duty is
faithful tradition where we can attain it. And so you would insist for
any one but yourself. Don't ask me to deny my spiritual parentage, when
I am finding the clue of my life in the recognition of natural
parentage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will ask for no promise till you see the reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>said Mordecai.
<div class="bookquote">``You have said the truth: I would obey the Master's rule for another.
But for years my hope, nay, my confidence, has been, not that the
imperfect image of my thought, which is an ill-shaped work of the
youthful carver who has seen a heavenly pattern, and trembles in
imitating the vision--not that this should live, but that my vision and
passion should enter into yours--yea, into yours; for he (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) whom I longed
for afar, was he (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) not you whom I discerned as mine when you came near?
Nevertheless, you shall judge. For my soul is satisfied.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div>Mordecai
paused, and then began in a changed tone, reverting to previous
suggestions from Deronda's disclosure: <div class="bookquote">``What moved your parents--?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) immediately checked himself, and added, <div class="bookquote">``Nay, I ask not that you
should tell me aught concerning others, unless it is your pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some time--gradually--you will know all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``But now tell
me more about yourselves, and how the time has passed since I went
away. I am sure there has been some trouble. Mirah has been in distress
about something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked at Mirah, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) immediately turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) brother,
appealing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to give the difficult answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would not
think it necessary to tell Deronda the facts about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) father on such
an evening as this. Just when Deronda had brought himself so near, and
identified himself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) brother, it was cutting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
should hear of this disgrace clinging about them, which seemed to have
become partly his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). To relieve herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) rose to take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hat and
cloak, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) would go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) own room: perhaps they would speak
more easily when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) had left them. But meanwhile Mordecai said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-day there has been a grief. A duty which seemed to have gone far
into the distance, has come back and turned its face upon us, and
raised no gladness--has raised a dread that we must submit to. But for
the moment we are delivered from any visible yoke. Let us defer
speaking of it as if this evening which is deepening about us were the
beginning of the festival in which we must offer the first fruits of
our joy, and mingle no mourning with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mordecai/MORDECAI</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda divined the hinted grief, and left it in silence, rising as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
saw Mirah rise, and saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Are you going? I must leave almost
immediately--when I and Mrs. Adam have mounted the precious chest, and
I have delivered the key to Mordecai--no, Ezra,--may I call him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) Ezra
now? I have learned to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) as Ezra since I have heard you call
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please call him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) Ezra,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, faintly, feeling a new timidity
under Deronda's glance and near presence. Was there really something
different about him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), or was the difference only in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) feeling? The
strangely various emotions of the last few hours had exhausted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)
was faint with fatigue and want of food. Deronda, observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) pallor
and tremulousness, longed to show more feeling, but dared not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) put
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) hand with an effort to smile, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) opened the door for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>). That was all.

<p/>A man of refined pride shrinks from making a lover's approaches to a
woman whose wealth or rank might make them appear presumptuous or
low-motived; but Deronda was finding a more delicate difficulty in a
position which, superficially taken, was the reverse of that--though to
an ardent reverential love, the loved woman has always a kind of wealth
and rank which makes a man keenly susceptible about the aspect of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
addresses. Deronda's difficulty was what any generous man might have
felt in some degree; but it affected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peculiarly through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
imaginative sympathy with a mind in which gratitude was strong. Mirah,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew, felt herself bound to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by deep obligations, which to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
sensibilities might give every wish of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the aspect of a claim; and
an inability to fulfill it would cause her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a pain continually revived
by their inevitable communion in care of Ezra. Here were fears not of
pride only, but of extreme tenderness. Altogether, to have the
character of a benefactor seemed to Deronda's anxiety an insurmountable
obstacle to confessing himself a lover, unless in some inconceivable
way it could be revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) that Mirah's heart had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
beforehand. And the agitation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own account, too, was not small.

<p/>Even a man who has practised himself in love-making till his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
glibness has rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sceptical, may at last be overtaken by the
lover's awe--may tremble, stammer, and show other signs of recovered
sensibility no more in the range of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acquired talents than pins and
needles after numbness: how much more may that energetic timidity
possess a man whose inward history has cherished his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) susceptibilities
instead of dulling them, and has kept all the language of passion fresh
and rooted as the lovely leafage about the hill-side spring!

<p/>As for Mirah her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dear head lay on its pillow that night with its former
suspicions thrown out of shape but still present, like an ugly story
which had been discredited but not therefore dissipated. All that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was certain of about Deronda seemed to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had no such
fetters upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been allowing herself to believe in. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
whole manner as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) words implied that there were no hidden
bonds remaining to have any effect in determining his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) future. But
notwithstanding this plainly reasonable inference, uneasiness still
clung about Mirah's heart. Deronda was not to blame, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had an
importance for Mrs. Grandcourt which must give her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) some hold on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).
And the thought of any close confidence between them stirred the little
biting snake that had long lain curled and harmless in Mirah's gentle
bosom.

<p/>But did she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) this evening feel as completely as before that her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) jealousy
was no less remote from any possibility for herself personally than if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) human soul had been lodged in the body of a fawn that Deronda had
saved from the archers? Hardly. Something indefinable had happened and
made a difference. The soft warm rain of blossoms which had fallen just
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was--did it really come because she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) was there? What spirit
was there among the boughs?




<p/>CHAPTER LXIV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Questa montagna e tale,
Che sempre al cominciar di sotto a grave.
E quanto uom piu va su e men fa male.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--DANTE: _Il Purgatorio_.


<p/>It was not many days after her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) mother's arrival that Gwendolen would
consent to remain at Genoa. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) desire to get away from that gem of the
sea, helped to rally her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) strength and courage. For what place, though
it were the flowery vale of Enna, may not the inward sense turn into a
circle of punishment where the flowers are no better than a crop of
flame-tongues burning the soles of our feet?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never like to see the Mediterranean again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, who thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) quite understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) child's
feeling--even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tacit prohibition of any express reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
late husband.

<p/>Mrs. Davilow, indeed, though compelled formally to regard this time as
one of severe calamity, was virtually enjoying her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
had ever done since her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) daughter's marriage. It seemed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) darling
was brought back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) not merely with all the old affection, but with
a conscious cherishing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's nearness, such as we give to a
possession that we have been on the brink of losing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you there, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>cried Gwendolen, in the middle of the night -LRB-a
bed had been made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother in the same room with hers-RRB-, very much
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would have done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) early girlhood, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had felt
frightened in lying awake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear; can I do anything for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you; only I like so to know you are there. Do you mind my
waking you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>-LRB-This question would hardly have been Gwendolen's in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
early girlhood.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not asleep, darling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seemed not real that you were with me. I wanted to make it real. I
can bear things if you are with me. But you must not lie awake, anxious
about me. You must be happy now. You must let me make you happy now at
last--else what shall I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, dear; I have the best happiness I can have, when you
make much of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But the next night, hearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was sighing and restless Mrs.
Davilow said, <div class="bookquote">``Let me give you your sleeping-draught, Gwendolen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mamma, thank you; I don't want to sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be so good for you to sleep more, my darling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say what would be good for me, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen answered,
impetuously. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know what would be good for me. You and my
uncle must not contradict me and tell me anything is good for me when I
feel it is not good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow was silent, not wondering that the poor child was
irritable. Presently Gwendolen said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was always naughty to you, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen insistently. <div class="bookquote">``It is because I was always
wicked that I am miserable now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) burst into sobs and cries. The determination to be silent about all
the facts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) married life and its close, reacted in these escapes
of enigmatic excitement.

<p/>But dim lights of interpretation were breaking on the mother's mind
through the information that came from Sir Hugo to Mr. Gascoigne, and,
with some omissions, from Mr. Gascoigne to herself. The good-natured
baronet, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) was attending to all decent measures in relation to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) nephew's death, and the possible washing ashore of the body,
thought it the kindest thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) could do to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) present friendly
intercourse with the rector as an opportunity for communicating with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>), in the mildest way, the purport of Grandcourt's will, so as to
save him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) the additional shock that would be in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) illusions all the way home. Perhaps Sir Hugo would have
been communicable enough without that kind motive, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) really felt
the motive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) broke the unpleasant news to the rector by degrees: at
first he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) only implied his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) fear that the widow was not so splendidly
provided for as Mr. Gascoigne, nay, as the baronet himself had
expected; and only at last, after some previous vague reference to
large claims on Grandcourt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) disclosed the prior relations which, in
the unfortunate absence of a legitimate heir, had determined all the
splendor in another direction.

<p/>The rector was deeply hurt, and remembered, more vividly than he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) had
ever done before, how offensively proud and repelling the manners of
the deceased had been toward him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>)--remembered also that he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) himself, in
that interesting period just before the arrival of the new occupant at
Diplow, had received hints of former entangling dissipations, and an
undue addiction to pleasure, though he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) had not foreseen that the
pleasure which had probably, so to speak, been swept into private
rubbish-heaps, would ever present itself as an array of live
caterpillars, disastrous to the green meat of respectable people. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) did not make these retrospective thoughts audible to Sir Hugo, or
lower himself by expressing any indignation on merely personal grounds,
but behaved like a man of the world who had become a conscientious
clergyman. His (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) first remark was--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When a young man makes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will in health, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usually counts on living
a long while. Probably Mr. Grandcourt did not believe that this will
would ever have its present effect.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``The
effect is painful in more ways than one. Female morality is likely to
suffer from this marked advantage and prominence being given to
illegitimate offspring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, in point of fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) comfortable way, <div class="bookquote">``since
the boy is there, this was really the best alternative for the disposal
of the estates. Grandcourt had nobody nearer than his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) cousin. And it's
a chilling thought that you go out of this life only for the benefit of
a cousin. A man gets a little pleasure in making his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will, if it's for
the good of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own curly heads; but it's a nuisance when you're giving
the bequeathing to a used-up fellow like yourself, and one you don't
care two straws for. It's the next worse thing to having only a life
interest in your estates. No; I forgive Grandcourt for that part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>)
will. But, between ourselves, what I don't forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) for, is the
shabby way he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) has provided for your niece--_our_ niece, I will say--no
better a position than if she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had been a doctor's widow. Nothing grates
on me more than that posthumous grudgingness toward a wife. A man ought
to have some pride and fondness for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) widow. _I_ should, I know. I
take it as a test of a man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels the easier about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can think of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and daughters being comfortable after it.
I like that story of the fellows in the Crimean war, who were ready to
go to the bottom of the sea if their widows were provided for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has certainly taken me by surprise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, <div class="bookquote">``all the
more because, as the one who stood in the place of father to my niece,
I had shown my reliance on Mr. Grandcourt's apparent liberality in
money matters by making no claims for her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) beforehand. That seemed to me
due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) under the circumstances. Probably you think me blamable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not blamable exactly. I respect a man for trusting another. But take
my advice. If you marry another niece, though it may be to the
Archbishop of Canterbury, bind him (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) down. Your niece can't be married
for the first time twice over. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>)'s a good fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>)'ll wish to
be bound. But as to Mrs. Grandcourt, I can only say that I feel my
relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) all the nearer because I think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) has not been
well treated. And I hope you will urge her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to rely on me as a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus spake the chivalrous Sir Hugo, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) disgust at the young and
beautiful widow of a Mallinger Grandcourt being left with only two
thousand a year and a house in a coal-mining district. To the rector
that income naturally appeared less shabby and less accompanied with
mortifying privations; but in this conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) had devoured a much
keener sense than the baronet's of the humiliation cast over his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) niece,
and also over her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) nearest friends, by the conspicuous publishing of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
husband's relation to Mrs. Glasher. And like all men who are good
husbands and fathers, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt the humiliation through the minds of the
women who would be chiefly affected by it; so that the annoyance of
first hearing the facts was far slighter than what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt in
communicating them to Mrs. Davilow, and in anticipating Gwendolen's
feeling whenever her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother saw fit to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) of them. For the good
rector had an innocent conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) niece was unaware of Mrs.
Glasher's existence, arguing with masculine soundness from what maidens
and wives were likely to know, do, and suffer, and having had a most
imperfect observation of the particular maiden and wife in question.
Not so Gwendolen's mother, who now thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw an explanation
of much that had been enigmatic in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) child's conduct and words before
and after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) engagement, concluding that in some inconceivable way
Gwendolen had been informed of this left-handed marriage and the
existence of the children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) trusted to opportunities that would
arise in moments of affectionate confidence before and during their
journey to England, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might gradually learn how far the actual
state of things was clear to Gwendolen, and prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) for anything
that might be a disappointment. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was spared from devices on the
subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you don't expect that I am going to be rich and grand, mamma,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, not long after the rector's communication; <div class="bookquote">``perhaps I
shall have nothing at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the rector</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was dressed, and had been sitting long in quiet meditation. Mrs.
Davilow was startled, but said, after a moment's reflection--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, dear, you will have something. Sir Hugo knows all about the
will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will not decide,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, abruptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, dear: Sir Hugo says you are to have two thousand a year and
the house at Gadsmere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I have will depend on what I accept,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``You and my
uncle must not attempt to cross me and persuade me about this. I will
do everything I can do to make you happy, but in anything about my
husband I must not be interfered with. Is eight hundred a year enough
for you, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More than enough, dear. You must not think of giving me so much.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Davilow paused a little, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you know who is to have the
estates and the rest of the money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand in dismissal of the subject. <div class="bookquote">``I
know everything. It is all perfectly right, and I wish never to have it
mentioned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The mother was silent, looked away, and rose to fetch a fan-screen,
with a slight flush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) delicate cheeks. Wondering, imagining, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
did not like to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) daughter's eyes, and sat down again under a
sad constraint. What wretchedness her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) child had perhaps gone through,
which yet must remain as it always had been, locked away from their
mutual speech. But Gwendolen was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother with that new
divination which experience had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and in tender relenting at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own peremptoriness, said, <div class="bookquote">``Come and sit nearer to me, mamma, and
don't be unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Davilow did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) was told, but bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) lips in the vain attempt
to hinder smarting tears. Gwendolen leaned toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) caressingly and
said, <div class="bookquote">``I mean to be very wise; I do, really. And good--oh, so good to
you, dear, old, sweet mamma, you won't know me. Only you must not cry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>The resolve that Gwendolen had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would ask
Deronda whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ought to accept any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's money--whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might accept what would enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother. The
poor thing felt strong enough to do anything that would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) a
higher place in Deronda's mind.

<p/>An invitation that Sir Hugo pressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with kind urgency was that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and Mrs. Davilow should go straight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) to Park Lane, and make
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) house their abode as long as mourning and other details needed
attending to in London. Town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) insisted, was just then the most
retired of places; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) proposed to exert himself at once in getting
all articles belonging to Gwendolen away from the house in Grosvenor
Square. No proposal could have suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) better than this of staying a
little while in Park Lane. It would be easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) there to have an
interview with Deronda, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) only knew how to get a letter into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
hands, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). During the journey, Sir Hugo, having
understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was acquainted with the purport of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's
will, ventured to talk before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) future
arrangements, referring here and there to mildly agreeable prospects as
matters of course, and otherwise shedding a decorous cheerfulness over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) widowed position. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) really the more graceful course
for a widow to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) spirits on finding that her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) husband had not
dealt as handsomely by her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might have done; it was the testator's
fault if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) compromised all her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) grief at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) departure by giving a
testamentary reason for it, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) might be supposed to look sad,
not because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), but because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) poor. The
baronet, having his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) kindliness doubly fanned by the favorable wind on
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fortunes and by compassion for Gwendolen, had become quite fatherly
in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) behavior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), called her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and in mentioning
Gadsmere to Mr. Gascoigne, with its various advantages and
disadvantages, spoke of what <div class="bookquote">``we''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>might do to make the best of that
property. Gwendolen sat by in pale silence while Sir Hugo, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
face turned toward Mrs. Davilow or Mr. Gascoigne, conjectured that Mrs.
Grandcourt might perhaps prefer letting Gadsmere to residing there
during any part of the year, in which case he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) thought that it might be
leased on capital terms to one of the fellows engaged with the coal:
Sir Hugo had seen enough of the place to know that it was as
comfortable and picturesque a box as any man need desire, providing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
desires were circumscribed within a coal area.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ shouldn't mind about the soot myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>any man</b></font>)</div>said the baronet, with that
dispassionateness which belongs to the potential mood. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing is more
healthy. And if one's business lay there, Gadsmere would be a paradise.
It makes quite a feature in Scrogg's history of the county, with the
little tower and the fine piece of water--the prettiest print in the
book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A more important place than Offendene, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Much,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet, decisively. <div class="bookquote">``I was there with my poor
brother--it is more than a quarter of a century ago, but I remember it
very well. The rooms may not be larger, but the grounds are on a
different scale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our poor dear Offendene is empty after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Davilow/Davilow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Davilow. <div class="bookquote">``When
it came to the point, Mr. Haynes declared off, and there has been no
one to take it since. I might as well have accepted Lord Brackenshaw's
kind offer that I should remain in it another year rent-free: for I
should have kept the place aired and warmed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you've something snug instead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A little too snug,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gascoigne/Gascoigne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gascoigne, smiling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) sister-in-law.
<div class="bookquote">``You are rather thick upon the ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen had turned with a changed glance when her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother spoke of
Offendene being empty. This conversation passed during one of the long
unaccountable pauses often experienced in foreign trains at some
country station. There was a dreamy, sunny stillness over the hedgeless
fields stretching to the boundary of poplars; and to Gwendolen the talk
within the carriage seemed only to make the dreamland larger with an
indistinct region of coal-pits, and a purgatorial Gadsmere which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
would never visit; till at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's words, this mingled, dozing
view seemed to dissolve and give way to a more wakeful vision of
Offendene and Pennicote under their cooler lights. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw the gray
shoulders of the downs, the cattle-specked fields, the shadowy
plantations with rutted lanes where the barked timber lay for a wayside
seat, the neatly-clipped hedges on the road from the parsonage to
Offendene, the avenue where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was gradually discerned from the
window, the hall-door opening, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother or one of the troublesome
sisters coming out to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). All that brief experience of a quiet
home which had once seemed a dullness to be fled from, now came back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as a restful escape, a station where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found the breath of
morning and the unreproaching voice of birds after following a lure
through a long Satanic masquerade, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had entered on with an
intoxicated belief in its disguises, and had seen the end of in
shrieking fear lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) herself had become one of the evil spirits who
were dropping their human mummery and hissing around her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with serpent
tongues.

<p/>In this way Gwendolen's mind paused over Offendene and made it the
scene of many thoughts; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gave no further outward sign of
interest in this conversation, any more than in Sir Hugo's opinion on
the telegraphic cable or her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) uncle's views of the Church Rate Abolition
Bill. What subjects will not our talk embrace in leisurely
day-journeying from Genoa to London? Even strangers, after glancing
from China to Peru and opening their mental stores with a liberality
threatening a mutual impression of poverty on any future meeting, are
liable to become excessively confidential. But the baronet and the
rector were under a still stronger pressure toward cheerful
communication: they were like acquaintances compelled to a long drive
in a mourning-coach who having first remarked that the occasion is a
melancholy one, naturally proceed to enliven it by the most
miscellaneous discourse. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind telling _you_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hugo/Hugo Mallinger</b></font>)</div>said Sir Hugo to
the rector, in mentioning some private details; while the rector,
without saying so, did not mind telling the baronet about his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) sons, and
the difficulty of placing them in the world. By the dint of discussing
all persons and things within driving-reach of Diplow, Sir Hugo got
himself wrought to a pitch of interest in that former home, and of
conviction that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) pleasant duty to regain and strengthen his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
personal influence in the neighborhood, that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) declare his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
intention of taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) family to the place for a month or two before
the autumn was over; and Mr. Gascoigne cordially rejoiced in that
prospect. Altogether, the journey was continued and ended with mutual
liking between the male fellow-travellers.

<p/>Meanwhile Gwendolen sat by like one who had visited the spirit-world
and was full to the lips of an unutterable experience that threw a
strange unreality over all the talk she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was hearing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own and the
world's business; and Mrs. Davilow was chiefly occupied in imagining
what her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) daughter was feeling, and in wondering what was signified by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) hinted doubt whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) would accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>) husband's bequest.
Gwendolen in fact had before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) the unsealed wall of an immediate
purpose shutting off every other resolution. How to scale the wall? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
wanted again to see and consult Deronda, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) might secure herself
against any act he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would disapprove. Would her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) remorse have maintained
its power within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), or would she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) have felt absolved by secrecy, if it
had not been for that outer conscience which was made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) by
Deronda? It is hard to say how much we could forgive ourselves if we
were secure from judgment by another whose opinion is the
breathing-medium of all our joy--who brings to us with close pressure
and immediate sequence that judgment of the Invisible and Universal
which self-flattery and the world's tolerance would easily melt and
disperse. In this way our brother may be in the stead of God to us, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) opinion which has pierced even to the joints and marrow, may be our
virtue in the making. That mission of Deronda to Gwendolen had begun
with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had felt to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) judgment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) at the gaming-table.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might easily have spoiled it:--much of our lives is spent in marring
our own influence and turning others' belief in us into a widely
concluding unbelief which they call knowledge of the world, while it is
really disappointment in you or me. Deronda had not spoiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mission.

<p/>But Gwendolen had forgotten to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) address in case she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
wanted to write, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) only way of reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was through Sir Hugo.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was not in the least blind to the construction that all witnesses
might put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) giving signs of dependence on Deronda, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seeking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>): Grandcourt's rebukes had sufficiently
enlightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pride. But the force, the tenacity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) nature had
thrown itself into that dependence, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would no more let go her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
hold on Deronda's help, or deny herself the interview her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) soul needed,
because of witnesses, than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been in prison in danger of being
condemned to death. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was in Park Lane and knew that the baronet
would be going down to the Abbey immediately -LRB-just to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) family
for a couple of days and then return to transact needful business for
Gwendolen-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) without any air of hesitation, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
mother was present--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Hugo, I wish to see Mr. Deronda again as soon as possible. I don't
know his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) address. Will you tell it me, or let him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) know that I want to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>A quick thought passed across Sir Hugo's face, but made no difference
to the ease with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I don't know whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)'s at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) chambers or the Abbey at this moment. But I'll make sure of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). I'll send a note now to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) chambers telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to come, and if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)'s at the Abbey I can give him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) your message and send him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) up at once.
I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) will want to obey your wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the baronet ended, with
grave kindness, as if nothing could seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) more in the appropriate
course of things than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should send such a message.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was convinced that Gwendolen had a passionate attachment to
Deronda, the seeds of which had been laid long ago, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) former
suspicion now recurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with more strength than ever, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
feeling was likely to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) into imprudences--in which kind-hearted
Sir Hugo was determined to screen and defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as far as lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
power. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) it was as pretty a story as need be that this fine
creature and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) favorite Dan should have turned out to be formed for
each other, and that the unsuitable husband should have made his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) exit
in such excellent time. Sir Hugo liked that a charming woman should be
made as happy as possible. In truth, what most vexed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) mind in this
matter at present was a doubt whether the too lofty and inscrutable Dan
had not got some scheme or other in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) head, which would prove to be
dearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) than the lovely Mrs. Grandcourt, and put that
neatly-prepared marriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) out of the question. It was among the
usual paradoxes of feeling that Sir Hugo, who had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) fatherly
cautions to Deronda against too much tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) relations with
the bride, should now feel rather irritated against him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) by the
suspicion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had not fallen in love as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ought to have done. Of
course all this thinking on Sir Hugo's part was eminently premature,
only a fortnight or so after Grandcourt's death. But it is the trick of
thinking to be either premature or behind-hand.

<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) sent the note to Deronda's chambers, and it found him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) there.




<p/>CHAPTER LXV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, welcome, pure-eyed Faith, white-handed Hope,
Thou hovering angel, girt with golden wings!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Milton/MILTON</b></font>)</div>--MILTON.


<p/>Deronda did not obey Gwendolen's new summons without some agitation.
Not his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) vanity, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) keen sympathy made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) susceptible to the
danger that another's heart might feel larger demands on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
would be able to fulfill; and it was no longer a matter of argument
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), but of penetrating consciousness, that Gwendolen's soul clung
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with a passionate need. We do not argue the existence of the
anger or the scorn that thrills through us in a voice; we simply feel
it, and it admits of no disproof. Deronda felt this woman's destiny
hanging on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) over a precipice of despair. Any one who knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
cannot wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) inward confession, that if all this had happened
little more than a year ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would hardly have asked himself whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); the impetuous determining impulse which would have moved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would have been to save her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from sorrow, to shelter her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life
forevermore from the dangers of loneliness, and carry out to the last
the rescue he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had begun in that monitory redemption of the necklace.
But now, love and duty had thrown other bonds around him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and that
impulse could no longer determine his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life; still, it was present in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as a compassionate yearning, a painful quivering at the very
imagination of having again and again to meet the appeal of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes
and words. The very strength of the bond, the certainty of the resolve,
that kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) asunder from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) gaze at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lot apart with the
more aching pity.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coming in the back drawing-room--part of that white and
crimson space where they had sat together at the musical party, where
Gwendolen had said for the first time that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lot depended on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) not
forsaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) appeal had seemed to melt into the melodic
cry--_Per pietà non dirmi addio_. But the melody had come from Mirah's
dear voice.

<p/>Deronda walked about this room, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had for years known by heart,
with a strange sense of metamorphosis in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own life. The familiar
objects around him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), from Lady Mallinger's gently smiling portrait to
the also human and urbane faces of the lions on the pilasters of the
chimney-piece, seemed almost to belong to a previous state of existence
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was revisiting in memory only, not in reality; so deep and
transforming had been the impressions he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had lately experienced, so new
were the conditions under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) found himself in the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had
been accustomed to think of as a home--standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
hand awaiting the entrance of a young creature whose life had also been
undergoing a transformation--a tragic transformation toward a wavering
result, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt with apprehensiveness that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own action was
still bound up.

<p/>But Gwendolen was come in, looking changed; not only by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mourning
dress, but by a more satisfied quietude of expression than he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had seen
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face at Genoa. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) satisfaction was that Deronda was there; but
there was no smile between them as they met and clasped hands; each was
full of remembrance--full of anxious prevision. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It was good
of you to come. Let us sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>immediately seating herself in the
nearest chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) placed himself opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked you to come because I want you to tell me what I ought to do,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) began, at once. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid of telling me what you think is
right, because it seems hard. I have made up my mind to do it. I was
afraid once of being poor; I could not bear to think of being under
other people; and that was why I did something--why I married. I have
borne worse things now. I think I could bear to be poor, if you think I
ought. Do you know about my husband's will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sir Hugo told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, already guessing the question
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had to ask.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ought I to take anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) has left me? I will tell you what I have
been thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with a more nervous eagerness. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps
you may not quite know that I really did think a good deal about my
mother when I married. I _was_ selfish, but I did love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and feel
about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) poverty; and what comforted me most at first, when I was
miserable, was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being better off because I had married. The thing
that would be hardest to me now would be to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in poverty again;
and I have been thinking that if I took enough to provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and
no more--nothing for myself--it would not be wrong; for I was very
precious to my mother--and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) took me from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) meant--and if
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had known--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen broke off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been preparing herself for this interview
by thinking of hardly anything else than this question of right toward
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother; but the question had carried with it thoughts and reasons
which it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to utter, and these perilous
remembrances swarmed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) words, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) speech more and more
agitated and tremulous. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked down helplessly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands, now
unladen of all rings except her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wedding-ring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not hurt yourself by speaking of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, tenderly.
<div class="bookquote">``There is no need; the case is very simple. I think I can hardly judge
wrongly about it. You consult me because I am the only person to whom
you have confided the most painful part of your experience: and I can
understand your scruples.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) did not go on immediately, waiting for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to recover herself. The silence seemed to Gwendolen full of the
tenderness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) voice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had courage to lift up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You are conscious of something
which you feel to be a crime toward one who is dead. You think that you
have forfeited all claim as a wife. You shrink from taking what was
his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). You want to keep yourself from profiting by his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) death. Your
feeling even urges you to some self-punishment--some scourging of the
self that disobeyed your better will--the will that struggled against
temptation. I have known something of that myself. Do I understand you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--at least, I want to be good--not like what I have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said
Gwendolen. <div class="bookquote">``I will try to bear what you think I ought to bear. I have
tried to tell you the worst about myself. What ought I to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If no one but yourself were concerned in this question of income,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``I should hardly dare to urge you against any remorseful
prompting; but I take as a guide now, your feeling about Mrs. Davilow,
which seems to me quite just. I cannot think that your husband's dues
even to yourself are nullified by any act you have committed. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
voluntarily entered into your life, and affected its course in what is
always the most momentous way. But setting that aside, it was due from
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) position that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should provide for your mother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) of
course understood that if this will took effect she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would share the
provision he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had made for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has had eight hundred a year. What I thought of was to take that
and leave the rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been so long inwardly
arguing for this as a permission, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind could not at once take
another attitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is not your duty to fix a limit in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.
<div class="bookquote">``You would be making a painful enigma for Mrs. Davilow; an income from
which you shut yourself out must be embittered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Davilow</b></font>). And your own
course would become too difficult. We agreed at Genoa that the burden
on your conscience is one what no one ought to be admitted to the
knowledge of. The future beneficence of your life will be best
furthered by your saving all others from the pain of that knowledge. In
my opinion you ought simply to abide by the provisions of your
husband's will, and let your remorse tell only on the use that you will
make of your monetary independence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>In uttering the last sentence Deronda automatically took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hat
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had laid on the floor beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). Gwendolen, sensitive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
slightest movement, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) heart giving a great leap, as if it too
had a consciousness of its own, and would hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) from going: in the
same moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) chair, unable to reflect that the
movement was an acceptance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) apparent intention to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and
Deronda, of course, also rose, advancing a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do what you tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, hurriedly; <div class="bookquote">``but what else
shall I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>No other than these simple words were possible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and
even these were too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in a state of emotion where her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) proud
secrecy was disenthroned: as the child-like sentences fell from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
lips they re-acted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) like a picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own helplessness, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not check the sob which sent the large tears to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes.
Deronda, too, felt a crushing pain; but imminent consequences were
visible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to the utmost exertion of conscience.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) tears away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, in a gently questioning
tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will probably be soon going with Mrs. Davilow into the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, in a week or ten days.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen waited an instant, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
eyes vaguely toward the window, as if looking at some imagined
prospect. <div class="bookquote">``I want to be kind to them all--they can be happier than I
can. Is that the best I can do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so. It is a duty that cannot be doubtful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
paused a little between his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) sentences, feeling a weight of anxiety on
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) words. <div class="bookquote">``Other duties will spring from it. Looking at your life
as a debt may seem the dreariest view of things at a distance; but it
cannot really be so. What makes life dreary is the want of motive: but
once beginning to act with that penitential, loving purpose you have in
your mind, there will be unexpected satisfactions--there will be
newly-opening needs--continually coming to carry you on from day to
day. You will find your life growing like a plant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with the look of one athirst toward
the sound of unseen waters. Deronda felt the look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had been
stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arms toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) from a forsaken shore. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) voice took an
affectionate imploringness when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This sorrow, which has cut down to the root, has come to you while you
are so young--try to think of it not as a spoiling of your life, but as
a preparation for it. Let it be a preparation--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Any one overhearing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tones would have thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was entreating for his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own happiness.
<div class="bookquote">``See! you have been saved from the worst evils that might have come
from your marriage, which you feel was wrong. You have had a vision of
injurious, selfish action--a vision of possible degradation; think that
a severe angel, seeing you along the road of error, grasped you by the
wrist and showed you the horror of the life you must avoid. And it has
come to you in your spring-time. Think of it as a preparation. You can,
you will, be among the best of women, such as make others glad that
they were born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>The words were like the touch of a miraculous hand to Gwendolen.
Mingled emotions streamed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) frame with a strength that seemed
the beginning of a new existence, having some new power or other which
stirred in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) vaguely. So pregnant is the divine hope of moral
recovery with the energy that fulfills it. So potent in us is the
infused action of another soul, before which we bow in complete love.
But the new existence seemed inseparable from Deronda: the hope seemed
to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) presence permanent. It was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) loved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and would cling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--a thought would have tottered with
improbability; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spiritual breath. For the first time since
that terrible moment on the sea a flush rose and spread over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cheek,
brow and neck, deepened an instant or two, and then gradually
disappeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not speak.

<p/>Deronda advanced and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand, saying, <div class="bookquote">``I must not weary you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was startled by the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was going, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), still without speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look ill yet--unlike yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) added, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't sleep much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) answered, with some return of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dispirited
manner. <div class="bookquote">``Things repeat themselves in me so. They come back--they will
all come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ended, shudderingly, a chill fear threatening her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By degrees they will be less insistent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not
drop her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand or move away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) abruptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Hugo says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) shall come to stay at Diplow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
snatching at previously intended words which had slipped away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You will come too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, and then feeling that the word was cold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
added, correctively, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then released her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand,
with the final friendly pressure of one who has virtually said good-bye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And not again here, before I leave town?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, with timid
sadness, looking as pallid as ever.

<p/>What could Deronda say? <div class="bookquote">``If I can be of any use--if you wish
me--certainly I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must wish it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, impetuously; <div class="bookquote">``you know I must wish
it. What strength have I? Who else is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Again a sob was rising.

<p/>Deronda felt a pang, which showed itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked
miserable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I will certainly come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen perceived the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) face; but the intense relief of
expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to come again could not give way to any other feeling,
and there was a recovery of the inspired hope and courage in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be unhappy about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, in a tone of affectionate
assurance. <div class="bookquote">``I shall remember your words--every one of them. I shall
remember what you believe about me; I shall try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) firmly, and put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hand again as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
forgotten what had passed since those words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) promised
to remember. But there was no approach to a smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
never smiled since her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's death. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stood still and in
silence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked like a melancholy statue of the Gwendolen whose
laughter had once been so ready when others were grave.

<p/>It is only by remembering the searching anguish which had changed the
aspect of the world for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that we can understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) behavior to
Deronda--the unreflecting openness, nay, the importunate pleading, with
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dependence on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). Considerations such as would
have filled the minds of indifferent spectators could not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
any more than if flames had been mounting around her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had flung
herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) open arms and clung about his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) neck that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might carry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) into safety. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) identified him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with the struggling regenerative
process in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) which had begun with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) action. Is it any wonder that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own necessity reflected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) feeling? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was in that
state of unconscious reliance and expectation which is a common
experience with us when we are preoccupied with our own trouble or our
own purposes. We diffuse our feeling over others, and count on their
acting from our motives. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination had not been turned to a
future union with Deronda by any other than the spiritual tie which had
been continually strengthening; but also it had not been turned toward
a future separation from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). Love-making and marriage--how could they
now be the imagery in which poor Gwendolen's deepest attachment could
spontaneously clothe itself? Mighty Love had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>);
but what had he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) demanded of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)? Acceptance of rebuke--the hard task of
self-change--confession--endurance. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cried toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), what then?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cried as the child cries whose little feet have fallen
backward--cried to be taken by the hand, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) should lose herself.

<p/>The cry pierced Deronda. What position could have been more difficult
for a man full of tenderness, yet with clear foresight? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the only
creature who knew the real nature of Gwendolen's trouble: to withdraw
himself from any appeal of hers would be to consign her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to a dangerous
loneliness. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not reconcile himself to the cruelty of apparently
rejecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dependence on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and yet in the nearer or farther
distance he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw a coming wrench, which all present strengthening of
their bond would make the harder.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was obliged to risk that. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went once and again to Park Lane before
Gwendolen left; but their interviews were in the presence of Mrs.
Davilow, and were therefore less agitating. Gwendolen, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had
determined to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) income, had conceived a project which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
liked to speak of: it was, to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother and sisters with herself
in Offendene again, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, piece back her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life unto that
time when they first went there, and when everything was happiness
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), only she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) did not know it. The idea had been mentioned to Sir
Hugo, who was going to exert himself about the letting of Gadsmere for
a rent which would more than pay the rent of Offendene. All this was
told to Deronda, who willingly dwelt on a subject that seemed to give
some soothing occupation to Gwendolen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said nothing and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) asked
nothing, of what chiefly occupied himself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind was fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
coming to Diplow before the autumn was over; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) no more thought of
the Lapidoths--the little Jewess and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brother--as likely to make a
difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) destiny, than of the fermenting political and social
leaven which was making a difference in the history of the world. In
fact poor Gwendolen's memory had been stunned, and all outside the
lava-lit track of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) troubled conscience, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) effort to get
deliverance from it, lay for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in dim forgetfulness.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVI.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``One day still fierce `mid many a day struck calm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>BROWNING</b></font>)</div>--BROWNING: _The King and the Book_.


<p/>Meanwhile Ezra and Mirah, whom Gwendolen did not include in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
thinking about Deronda, were having their relation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) drawn closer
and brought into fuller light.

<p/>The father Lapidoth had quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter at the doorstep, ruled by
that possibility of staking something in play or betting which
presented itself with the handling of any sum beyond the price of
staying actual hunger, and left no care for alternative prospects or
resolutions. Until he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had lost everything he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never considered whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would apply to Mirah again or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would brave his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son's
presence. In the first moment he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had shrunk from encountering Ezra as
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have shrunk from any other situation of disagreeable
constraint; and the possession of Mirah's purse was enough to banish
the thought of future necessities. The gambling appetite is more
absolutely dominant than bodily hunger, which can be neutralized by an
emotional or intellectual excitation; but the passion for watching
chances--the habitual suspensive poise of the mind in actual or
imaginary play--nullifies the susceptibility of other excitation. In
its final, imperious stage, it seems the unjoyous dissipation of
demons, seeking diversion on the burning marl of perdition.

<p/>But every form of selfishness, however abstract and unhuman, requires
the support of at least one meal a day; and though Lapidoth's appetite
for food and drink was extremely moderate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) had slipped into a
shabby, unfriendly form of life in which the appetite could not be
satisfied without some ready money. When, in a brief visit at a house
which announced <div class="bookquote">``Pyramids''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on the window-blind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) had first doubled
and trebled and finally lost Mirah's thirty shillings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) went out with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) empty purse in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) pocket, already balancing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) mind whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
should get another immediate stake by pawning the purse, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
should go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) giving himself a good countenance by restoring
the purse, and declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) had used the money in paying a score
that was standing against him (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>). Besides, among the sensibilities still
left strong in Lapidoth was the sensibility to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) own claims, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
appeared to himself to have a claim on any property his (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) children might
possess, which was stronger than the justice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) son's resentment.
After all, to take up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) lodging with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) children was the best thing
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) could do; and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) thought of meeting Ezra the less he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) winced
from it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) imagination being more wrought on by the chances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
getting something into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) pocket with safety and without exertion,
than by the threat of a private humiliation. Luck had been against him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
lately; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) expected it to turn--and might not the turn begin with some
opening of supplies which would present itself through his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) daughter's
affairs and the good friends she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had spoken of? Lapidoth counted on the
fascination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) cleverness--an old habit of mind which early
experience had sanctioned: and it is not only women who are unaware of
their diminished charm, or imagine that they can feign not to be worn
out.

<p/>The result of Lapidoth's rapid balancing was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) went toward the
little square in Brompton with the hope that, by walking about and
watching, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) might catch sight of Mirah going out or returning, in
which case his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) entrance into the house would be made easier. But it was
already evening--the evening of the day next to that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) had first
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>); and after a little waiting, weariness made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) reflect that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) might ring, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) were not at home he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) might ask the time at
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) was expected. But on coming near the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
was at home: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) singing.

<p/>Mirah, seated at the piano, was pouring forth <div class="bookquote">''_Herz, mein Herz_,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>while Ezra was listening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) eyes shut, when Mrs. Adam opened the
door, and said in some embarrassment--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A gentleman below says he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is your father, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Adam/Adam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go down to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, starting up immediately and
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mirah, not so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Ezra, with decision. <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) come up, Mrs.
Adam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mirah stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hands pinching each other, and feeling sick with
anxiety, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) continued looking at Ezra, who had also risen, and
was evidently much shaken. But there was an expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) face
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) had never seen before; his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) brow was knit, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) lips seemed
hardened with the same severity that gleamed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) eye.

<p/>When Mrs. Adam opened the door to let in the father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could not help
casting a look at the group, and after glancing from the younger man to
the elder, said to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) closed the door, <div class="bookquote">``Father, sure
enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The likeness was that of outline, which is always most
striking at the first moment; the expression had been wrought into the
strongest contrasts by such hidden or inconspicuous differences as can
make the genius of a Cromwell within the outward type of a father who
was no more than a respectable parishioner.

<p/>Lapidoth had put on a melancholy expression beforehand, but there was
some real wincing in his (<font color='blue'><b>parishioner</b></font>) frame as he (<font color='blue'><b>parishioner</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Ezra, my boy, you hardly know me after so many years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you--too well--father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Ezra, with a slow biting solemnity
which made the word father a reproach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are not pleased with me. I don't wonder at it. Appearances
have been against me. When a man gets into straits he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't do just as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would by himself or anybody else, _I_'ve suffered enough, I know,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lapidoth/Miss Lapidoth</b></font>)</div>said Lapidoth, quickly. In speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always recovered some glibness
and hardihood; and now turning toward Mirah, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) purse,
saying, ``Here's your little purse, my dear. I thought you'd be anxious
about it because of that bit of writing. I've emptied it, you'll see,
for I had a score to pay for food and lodging. I knew you would like me
to clear myself, and here I stand--without a single farthing in my
pocket--at the mercy of my children. You can turn me out if you like,
without getting a policeman. Say the word, Mirah; say, ``Father, I've
had enough of you; you made a pet of me, and spent your all on me, when
I couldn't have done without you; but I can do better without you
now,<div class="bookquote">''--say that, and I'm gone out like a spark. I shan't spoil your
pleasure again.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The tears were in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice as usual, before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I could never say it, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>answered Mirah, with not the
less anguish because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) felt the falsity of everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) speech
except the implied wish to remain in the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mirah, my sister, leave us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Ezra, in a tone of authority.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) brother falteringly, beseechingly--in awe of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
decision, yet unable to go without making a plea for this father who
was like something that had grown in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) flesh with pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) went
close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) brother, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), said, in a low
voice, but not so low as to be unheard by Lapidoth, <div class="bookquote">``Remember,
Ezra--you said my mother would not have shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lapidoth/Miss Lapidoth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Trust me, and go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>said Ezra.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) left the room, but after going a few steps up the stairs, sat down
with a palpitating heart. If, because of anything her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) brother said to
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went away--

<p/>Lapidoth had some sense of what was being prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) son's
mind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was beginning to adjust himself to the situation and find
a point of view that would give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a cool superiority to any attempt
at humiliating him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). This haggard son, speaking as from a sepulchre, had
the incongruity which selfish levity learns to see in suffering, and
until the unrelenting pincers of disease clutch its own flesh. Whatever
preaching he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might deliver must be taken for a matter of course, as a
man finding shelter from hail in an open cathedral might take a little
religious howling that happened to be going on there.

<p/>Lapidoth was not born with this sort of callousness: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had achieved it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This home that we have here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>Ezra began, ``is maintained partly by the
generosity of a beloved friend who supports me, and partly by the
labors of my sister, who supports herself. While we have a home we will
not shut you out from it. We will not cast you out to the mercy of your
vices. For you are our father, and though you have broken your bond, we
acknowledge ours. But I will never trust you. You absconded with money,
leaving your debts unpaid; you forsook my mother; you robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
little child and broke her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart; you have become a gambler, and where
shame and conscience were there sits an insatiable desire; you were
ready to sell my sister--you had sold her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), but the price was denied
you. The man who has done these things must never expect to be trusted
any more. We will share our food with you--you shall have a bed, and
clothing. We will do this duty to you, because you are our father. But
you will never be trusted. You are an evil man: you made the misery of
our mother. That such a man is our father is a brand on our flesh which
will not cease smarting. But the Eternal has laid it upon us; and
though human justice were to flog you for crimes, and your body fell
helpless before the public scorn, we would still say, <div class="bookquote">``This is our
father; make way, that we may carry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out of your sight.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lapidoth/Miss Lapidoth</b></font>)</div><p/>Lapidoth, in adjusting himself to what was coming, had not been able to
foresee the exact intensity of the lightning or the exact course it
would take--that it would not fall outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) frame but through it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
could not foresee what was so new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) as this voice from the soul of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) son. It touched that spring of hysterical excitability which Mirah
used to witness in him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) sat at home and sobbed. As Ezra ended,
Lapidoth threw himself into a chair and cried like a woman, burying his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
face against the table--and yet, strangely, while this hysterical
crying was an inevitable reaction in him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) under the stress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) son's
words, it was also a conscious resource in a difficulty; just as in
early life, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) was a bright-faced curly young man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) had been
used to avail himself of this subtly-poised physical susceptibility to
turn the edge of resentment or disapprobation.

<p/>Ezra sat down again and said nothing--exhausted by the shock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) own
irrepressible utterance, the outburst of feelings which for years he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
had borne in solitude and silence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) thin hands trembled on the arms
of the chair; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) would hardly have found voice to answer a question; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) had taken a step toward beckoning Death. Meanwhile
Mirah's quick expectant ear detected a sound which her (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) heart
recognized: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) could not stay out of the room any longer. But on
opening the door her (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) immediate alarm was for Ezra, and it was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
side that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) went, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) trembling hand in hers, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) pressed
and found support in; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) did not speak or even look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>). The
father with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face buried was conscious that Mirah had entered, and
presently lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) handkerchief against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
eyes, put out his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>), and said with plaintive hoarseness,
<div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Mirah; your father will not trouble you again. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) deserves
to die like a dog by the roadside, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will. If your mother had
lived, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have forgiven me--thirty-four years ago I put the ring
on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) finger under the _Chuppa_, and we were made one. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have
forgiven me, and we should have spent our old age together. But I
haven't deserved it. Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rose from the chair as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said the last <div class="bookquote">``good-bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mirah had put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and held him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) was not tearful and grieving, but
frightened and awe-struck, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) cried out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, father, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) brother, ``Ezra, you have not
forbidden him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)?--Stay, father, and leave off wrong things. Ezra, I
cannot bear it. How can I say to my father, <div class="bookquote">``Go and die!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not said it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>Ezra answered, with great effort. <div class="bookquote">``I have said,
stay and be sheltered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you will stay, father--and be taken care of--and come with me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) toward the door.

<p/>This was really what Lapidoth wanted. And for the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) felt a sort
of comfort in recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) daughter's dutiful attendance, that made a
change of habits seem possible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) down to the parlor
below, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my sitting-room when I am not with Ezra, and there is a
bed-room behind which shall be yours. You will stay and be good,
father. Think that you are come back to my mother, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has
forgiven you--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) speaks to you through me.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Mirah's tones were
imploring, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not give one of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) former caresses.

<p/>Lapidoth quickly recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) composure, began to speak to Mirah of
the improvement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) voice, and other easy subjects, and when Mrs.
Adam came to lay out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) supper, entered into converse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) in
order to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) was not a common person, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) clothes
were just now against him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>).

<p/>But in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) usual wakefulness at night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) fell to wondering what money
Mirah had by her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>), and went back over old Continental hours at
_Roulette_, reproducing the method of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) play, and the chances that
had frustrated it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) reasons for coming to England, but
for most things it was a cursed country.

<p/>These were the stronger visions of the night with Lapidoth, and not the
worn frame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) ireful son uttering a terrible judgment. Ezra did
pass across the gaming-table, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) words were audible; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) passed
like an insubstantial ghost, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) words had the heart eaten out of
them by numbers and movements that seemed to make the very tissue of
Lapidoth's consciousness.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVII.

<p/>The godhead in us wrings our noble deeds
From our reluctant selves.


<p/>It was an unpleasant surprise to Deronda when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) returned from the
Abbey to find the undesirable father installed in the lodgings at
Brompton. Mirah had felt it necessary to speak of Deronda to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
father, and even to make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as fully aware as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) could of the way in
which the friendship with Ezra had begun, and of the sympathy which had
cemented it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) passed more lightly over what Deronda had done for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>), omitting altogether the rescue from drowning, and speaking of the
shelter she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) had found in Mrs. Meyrick's family so as to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
father to suppose that it was through these friends Deronda had become
acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) could not persuade herself to more
completeness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) narrative: she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) could not let the breath of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)
father's soul pass over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) relation to Deronda. And Lapidoth, for
reasons, was not eager in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) questioning about the circumstances of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) flight and arrival in England. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was much interested in the
fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) children having a beneficent friend apparently high in the
world.

<p/>It was the brother who told Deronda of this new condition added to
their life. <div class="bookquote">``I am become calm in beholding him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>Ezra ended, <div class="bookquote">``and I
try to think it possible that my sister's tenderness, and the daily
tasting a life of peace, may win him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to remain aloof from temptation. I
have enjoined her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has promised, to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with no money. I
have convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will buy with it his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own destruction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda first came on the third day from Ladipoth's arrival. The new
clothes for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been measured were not yet ready, and wishing
to make a favorable impression, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) did not choose to present himself in
the old ones. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) watched for Deronda's departure, and, getting a view
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) from the window, was rather surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) youthfulness, which
Mirah had not mentioned, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had somehow thought out of the
question in a personage who had taken up a grave friendship and hoary
studies with the sepulchral Ezra. Lapidoth began to imagine that
Deronda's real or chief motive must be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was in love with Mirah.
And so much the better; for a tie to Mirah had more promise of
indulgence for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) father than a tie to Ezra: and Lapidoth was not
without the hope of recommending himself to Deronda, and of softening
any hard prepossessions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was behaving with much amiability, and
trying in all ways at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) command to get himself into easy
domestication with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) children--entering into Mirah's music, showing
himself docile about smoking, which Mrs. Adam could not tolerate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
parlor, and walking out in the square with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) German pipe, and the
tobacco with which Mirah supplied him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was too acute to offer any
present remonstrance against the refusal of money, which Mirah told him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) must persist in as a solemn duty promised to her (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was comfortable enough to wait.

<p/>The next time Deronda came, Lapidoth, equipped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) new clothes, and
satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own appearance, was in the room with Ezra, who was
teaching himself, as a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) severe duty, to tolerate his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
father's presence whenever it was imposed. Deronda was cold and
distant, the first sight of this man, who had blighted the lives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
wife and children, creating in him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) a repulsion that was even a physical
discomfort. But Lapidoth did not let himself be discouraged, asked
leave to stay and hear the reading of papers from the old chest, and
actually made himself useful in helping to decipher some difficult
German manuscript. This led him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to suggest that it might be desirable
to make a transcription of the manuscript, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) services
for this purpose, and also to make copies of any papers in Roman
characters. Though Ezra's young eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) observed were getting weak, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
own were still strong. Deronda accepted the offer, thinking that
Lapidoth showed a sign of grace in the willingness to be employed
usefully; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw a gratified expression in Ezra's face, who,
however, presently said, <div class="bookquote">``Let all the writing be done here; for I
cannot trust the papers out of my sight, lest there be an accident by
burning or otherwise.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>Poor Ezra felt very much as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) had a convict
on leave under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) charge. Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) father working, it was not
possible to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) would work in good faith. But by this
arrangement he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) fastened on himself the burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) father's presence,
which was made painful not only through his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) deepest, longest
associations, but also through Lapidoth's restlessness of temperament,
which showed itself the more as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) become familiarized with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
situation, and lost any awe he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) had felt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) son. The fact was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
was putting a strong constraint on himself in confining his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) attention
for the sake of winning Deronda's favor; and like a man in an
uncomfortable garment he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) gave himself relief at every opportunity,
going out to smoke, or moving about and talking, or throwing himself
back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) chair and remaining silent, but incessantly carrying on a
dumb language of facial movement or gesticulation: and if Mirah were in
the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would fall into his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) old habit of talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), gossiping
about their former doings and companions, or repeating quirks and
stories, and plots of the plays he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) used to adapt, in the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
could at will command the vivacity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) earlier time. All this was a
mortal infliction to Ezra; and when Mirah was at home she (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) tried to
relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>), by getting her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father down into the parlor and keeping
watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) there. What duty is made of a single difficult resolve?
The difficulty lies in the daily unflinching support of consequences
that mar the blessed return of morning with the prospect of irritation
to be suppressed or shame to be endured. And such consequences were
being borne by these, as by many other heroic children of an unworthy
father--with the prospect, at least to Mirah, of their stretching
onward through the solid part of life.

<p/>Meanwhile Lapidoth's presence had raised a new impalpable partition
between Deronda and Mirah--each of them dreading the soiling inferences
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind, each of them interpreting mistakenly the increased reserve
and diffidence of the other. But it was not very long before some light
came to Deronda.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could, after returning from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) brief visit to the Abbey,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had called at Hans Meyrick's rooms, feeling it, on more grounds than
one, a due of friendship that Hans should be at once acquainted with
the reasons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) late journey, and the changes of intention it had
brought about. Hans was not there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was said to be in the country for
a few days; and Deronda, after leaving a note, waited a week, rather
expecting a note in return. But receiving no word, and fearing some
freak of feeling in the incalculably susceptible Hans, whose proposed
sojourn at the Abbey he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) knew had been deferred, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) at length made a
second call, and was admitted into the painting-room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) found
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) friend in a light coat, without a waistcoat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) long hair still
wet from a bath, but with a face looking worn and wizened--anything but
country-like. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) palette and brushes, and stood before
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) easel when Deronda entered, but the equipment and attitude seemed
to have been got up on short notice.

<p/>As they shook hands, Deronda said, <div class="bookquote">``You don't look much as if you had
been in the country, old fellow. Is it Cambridge you have been to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, curtly, throwing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) palette with the air of one
who has begun to feign by mistake; then pushing forward a chair for
Deronda, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) threw himself into another, and leaned backward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) head, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``I've been to
I-don`t-know-where--No man's land--and a mortally unpleasant country it
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say you have been drinking, Hans,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, who
had seated himself opposite, in anxious survey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing so good. I've been smoking opium. I always meant to do it some
time or other, to try how much bliss could be got by it; and having
found myself just now rather out of other bliss, I thought it judicious
to seize the opportunity. But I pledge you my word I shall never tap a
cask of that bliss again. It disagrees with my constitution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has been the matter? You were in good spirits enough when you
wrote to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing in particular. The world began to look seedy--a sort of
cabbage-garden with all the cabbages cut. A malady of genius, you may
be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, creasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) face into a smile; <div class="bookquote">``and, in fact, I
was tired of being virtuous without reward, especially in this hot
London weather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing else? No real vexation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/>Hans shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to tell you of my own affairs, but I can't do it with a good
grace if you are to hide yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't an affair in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, in a flighty way, <div class="bookquote">``except
a quarrel with a bric-à-brac man. Besides, as it is the first time in
our lives that you ever spoke to me about your own affairs, you are
only beginning to pay a pretty long debt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda felt convinced that Hans was behaving artificially, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
trusted to a return of the old frankness by-and-by if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) own
confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You laughed at the mystery of my journey to Italy, Hans,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) began.
<div class="bookquote">``It was for an object that touched my happiness at the very roots. I
had never known anything about my parents, and I really went to Genoa
to meet my mother. My father has been long dead--died when I was an
infant. My mother was the daughter of an eminent Jew; my father was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
cousin. Many things had caused me to think of this origin as almost a
probability before I set out. I was so far prepared for the result that
I was glad of it--glad to find myself a Jew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not expect me to look surprised, Deronda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, who had
changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) attitude, laying one leg across the other and examining the
heel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) slipper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You knew it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother told me. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went to the house the morning after you had
been there--brother and sister both told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). You may imagine we can't
rejoice as they do. But whatever you are glad of, I shall come to be
glad of in the end--_when_ exactly the end may be I can't predict,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, speaking in a low tone, which was as usual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) as it
was to be out of humor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) lot, and yet bent on making no fuss
about it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite understand that you can't share my feeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda;
<div class="bookquote">``but I could not let silence lie between us on what casts quite a new
light over my future. I have taken up some of Mordecai's ideas, and I
mean to try and carry them out, so far as one man's efforts can go. I
dare say I shall by and by travel to the East and be away for some
years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Hans said nothing, but rose, seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) palette and began to work his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
brush on it, standing before his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) picture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) back to Deronda, who
also felt himself at a break in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) path embarrassed by Hans's
embarrassment.

<p/>Presently Hans said, again speaking low, and without turning, <div class="bookquote">``Excuse
the question, but does Mrs. Grandcourt know of all this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; and I must beg of you, Hans,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, rather angrily, <div class="bookquote">``to
cease joking on that subject. Any notions you have are wide of the
truth--are the very reverse of the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am no more inclined to joke than I shall be at my own funeral,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said
Hans. <div class="bookquote">``But I am not at all sure that you are aware what are my notions
on that subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``But let me say, once for all, that in
relation to Mrs. Grandcourt, I never have had, and never shall have the
position of a lover. If you have ever seriously put that interpretation
on anything you have observed, you are supremely mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence a little while, and to each the silence was like an
irritating air, exaggerating discomfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I have been mistaken in another interpretation, also,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said
Hans, presently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you had no wish to hold the position of a lover toward another
woman, who is neither wife nor widow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't pretend not to understand you, Meyrick. It is painful that our
wishes should clash. I hope you will tell me if you have any ground for
supposing that you would succeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That seems rather a superfluous inquiry on your part, Deronda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said
Hans, with some irritation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why superfluous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you are perfectly convinced on the subject--and probably have
had the very best evidence to convince you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be more frank with you than you are with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
still heated by Hans' show of temper, and yet sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have
never had the slightest evidence that I should succeed myself. In fact,
I have very little hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Hans looked round hastily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) friend, but immediately turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
picture again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And in our present situation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, hurt by the idea that
Hans suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) of insincerity, and giving an offended emphasis to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) words, <div class="bookquote">``I don't see how I can deliberately make known my feeling to
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could not return it, I should have embittered her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) best
comfort; for neither she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) nor I can be parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brother, and we
should have to meet continually. If I were to cause her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that sort of
pain by an unwilling betrayal of my feeling, I should be no better than
a mischievous animal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I have ever betrayed _my_ feeling to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said
Hans, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) were vindicating himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that we are on a level, then; you have no reason to envy me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not the slightest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, with bitter irony. <div class="bookquote">``You have
measured my conceit and know that it out-tops all your advantages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a nuisance to you, Meyrick. I am sorry, but I can't help it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, rising. <div class="bookquote">``After what passed between us before, I wished to
have this explanation; and I don't see that any pretensions of mine
have made a real difference to you. They are not likely to make any
pleasant difference to myself under present circumstances. Now the
father is there--did you know that the father is there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were not a Jew I would permit myself to damn him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--with
faint praise, I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, but with no smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) and I meet under greater constraint than ever. Things might go on
in this way for two years without my getting any insight into her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
feeling toward me. That is the whole state of affairs, Hans. Neither
you nor I have injured the other, that I can see. We must put up with
this sort of rivalry in a hope that is likely enough to come to
nothing. Our friendship can bear that strain, surely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>said Hans, impetuously, throwing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) tools,
thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) coat-pockets, and turning round to face
Deronda, who drew back a little and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with amazement. Hans
went on in the same tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our friendship--my friendship--can't bear the strain of behaving to
you like an ungrateful dastard and grudging you your happiness. For you
_are_ the happiest dog in the world. If Mirah loves anybody better than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>) brother, _you are the man_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Hans turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) heel and threw himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) chair, looking up at
Deronda with an expression the reverse of tender. Something like a
shock passed through Deronda, and, after an instant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a good-natured fiction of yours, Hans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not in a good-natured mood. I assure you I found the fact
disagreeable when it was thrust on me--all the more, or perhaps all the
less, because I believed then that your heart was pledged to the
duchess. But now, confound you! you turn out to be in love in the right
place--a Jew--and everything eligible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me what convinced you--there's a good fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda,
distrusting a delight that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was unused to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask. Little mother was witness. The upshot is, that Mirah is
jealous of the duchess, and the sooner you relieve your mind the
better. There! I've cleared off a score or two, and may be allowed to
swear at you for getting what you deserve--which is just the very best
luck I know of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Hans!''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand, which the
other took and wrung in silence.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All thoughts, all passions, all delights,
Whatever stirs this mortal frame,
All are but ministers of Love,
And feed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) sacred flame.''
 (<font color='red'><b>COLERIDGE</b></font>)</div>--COLERIDGE.


<p/>Deronda's eagerness to confess his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) love could hardly have had a
stronger stimulus than Hans had given it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) assurance that Mirah
needed relief from jealousy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) next visit to Ezra with the
determination to be resolute in using--nay, in requesting--an
opportunity of private conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) love,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) felt courageous about all other consequences, and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) betrothed
husband he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) would gain a protective authority which might be a desirable
defense for her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in future difficulties with her (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) father. Deronda had not
observed any signs of growing restlessness in Lapidoth, or of
diminished desire to recommend himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had forebodings of some
future struggle, some mortification, or some intolerable increase of
domestic disquietude in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might save Ezra and Mirah from being
helpless victims.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) forebodings would have been strengthened if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had known what was
going on in the father's mind. That amount of restlessness, that
desultoriness of attention, which made a small torture to Ezra, was to
Lapidoth an irksome submission to restraint, only made bearable by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
thinking of it as a means of by-and-by securing a well-conditioned
freedom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) began with the intention of awaiting some really good
chance, such as an opening for getting a considerable sum from Deronda;
but all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was looking about curiously, and trying to
discover where Mirah deposited her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) money and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) keys. The imperious
gambling desire within him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), which carried on its activity through every
other occupation, and made a continuous web of imagination that held
all else in its meshes, would hardly have been under the control of a
contracted purpose, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had been able to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hands on any sum
worth capturing. But Mirah, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) practical clear-sightedness,
guarded against any frustration of the promise she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) had given to Ezra,
by confiding all money, except what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) was immediately in want of, to
Mrs. Meyrick's care, and Lapidoth felt himself under an irritating
completeness of supply in kind as in a lunatic asylum where everything
was made safe against him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>). To have opened a desk or drawer of Mirah's,
and pocketed any bank-notes found there, would have been to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) mind a
sort of domestic appropriation which had no disgrace in it; the degrees
of liberty a man allows himself with other people's property being
often delicately drawn, even beyond the boundary where the law begins
to lay its hold--which is the reason why spoons are a safer investment
than mining shares. Lapidoth really felt himself injuriously treated by
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter, and thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to have had what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) other earnings as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) apple-tart. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained
submissive; indeed, the indiscretion that most tempted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), was not any
insistance with Mirah, but some kind of appeal to Deronda. Clever
persons who have nothing else to sell can often put a good price on
their absence, and Lapidoth's difficult search for devices forced upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) the idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) family would find themselves happier without him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>),
and that Deronda would be willing to advance a considerable sum for the
sake of getting rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). But, in spite of well-practiced hardihood,
Lapidoth was still in some awe of Ezra's imposing friend, and deferred
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) purpose indefinitely.

<p/>On this day, when Deronda had come full of a gladdened consciousness,
which inevitably showed itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) air and speech, Lapidoth was at a
crisis of discontent and longing that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) mind busy with schemes
of freedom, and Deronda's new amenity encouraged them. This
pre-occupation was at last so strong as to interfere with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) usual
show of interest in what went forward, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) persistence in sitting
by even when there was reading which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not follow. After sitting
a little while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went out to smoke and walk in the square, and the
two friends were all the easier. Mirah was not at home, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) was
sure to be in again before Deronda left, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes glowed with a
secret anticipation: he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) again he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) should
see some sweetness of recognition for himself to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes had
been sealed before. There was an additional playful affectionateness in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) manner toward Ezra.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This little room is too close for you, Ezra,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) said, breaking off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) reading. <div class="bookquote">``The week's heat we sometimes get here is worse than the
heat in Genoa, where one sits in the shaded coolness of large rooms.
You must have a better home now. I shall do as I like with you, being
the stronger half.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) smiled toward Ezra, who said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am straitened for nothing except breath. But you, who might be in a
spacious palace, with the wide green country around you, find this a
narrow prison. Nevertheless, I cannot say, `Go.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the country would be a banishment while you are here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, rising and walking round the double room, which yet offered no
long promenade, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) made a great fan of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) handkerchief. <div class="bookquote">``This is
the happiest room in the world to me. Besides, I will imagine myself in
the East, since I am getting ready to go there some day. Only I will
not wear a cravat and a heavy ring there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) ended emphatically,
pausing to take off those superfluities and deposit them on a small
table behind Ezra, who had the table in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) covered with books
and papers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been wearing my memorable ring ever since I came home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) went
on, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) reseated himself. <div class="bookquote">``But I am such a Sybarite that I constantly
put it off as a burden when I am doing anything. I understand why the
Romans had summer rings--_if_ they had them. Now then, I shall get on
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were soon absorbed in their work again. Deronda was reading a
piece of rabbinical Hebrew under Ezra's correction and comment, and
they took little notice when Lapidoth re-entered and took a seat
somewhat in the background.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) rambling eyes quickly alighted on the ring that sparkled on the bit
of dark mahogany. During his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) walk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) mind had been occupied with the
fiction of an advantageous opening for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) abroad, only requiring a sum
of ready money, which, on being communicated to Deronda in private,
might immediately draw from him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) a question as to the amount of the
required sum: and it was this part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) forecast that Lapidoth found
the most debatable, there being a danger in asking too much, and a
prospective regret in asking too little. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own desire gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) no
limit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was quite without guidance as to the limit of Deronda's
willingness. But now, in the midst of these airy conditions preparatory
to a receipt which remained indefinite, this ring, which on Deronda's
finger had become familiar to Lapidoth's envy, suddenly shone detached
and within easy grasp. Its value was certainly below the smallest of
the imaginary sums that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) purpose fluctuated between; but then it was
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as a solid fact, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) desire at once leaped into the
thought -LRB-not yet an intention-RRB- that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) were quietly to pocket that
ring and walk away he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would have the means of comfortable escape from
present restraint, without trouble, and also without danger; for any
property of Deronda's -LRB-available without his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) formal consent-RRB- was all
one with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) children's property, since their father would never be
prosecuted for taking it. The details of this thinking followed each
other so quickly that they seemed to rise before him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as one picture.
Lapidoth had never committed larceny; but larceny is a form of
appropriation for which people are punished by law; and, take this ring
from a virtual relation, who would have been willing to make a much
heavier gift, would not come under the head of larceny. Still, the
heavier gift was to be preferred, if Lapidoth could only make haste
enough in asking for it, and the imaginary action of taking the ring,
which kept repeating itself like an inward tune, sank into a rejected
idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) urgent longing by resolving to go below, and
watch for the moment of Deronda's departure, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would ask leave to
join him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) walk and boldly carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) meditated plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rose
and stood looking out of the window, but all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) saw what lay
beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)--the brief passage he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would have to make to the door close
by the table where the ring was. However he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was resolved to go down;
but--by no distinct change of resolution, rather by a dominance of
desire, like the thirst of the drunkard--it so happened that in passing
the table his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) fingers fell noiselessly on the ring, and he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) found
himself in the passage with the ring in his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) hand. It followed that he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>)
put on his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) hat and quitted the house. The possibility of again throwing
himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) children receded into the indefinite distance, and
before he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) was out on the square his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) sense of haste had concentrated
itself on selling the ring and getting on shipboard.

<p/>Deronda and Ezra were just aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) exit; that was all. But,
by-and-by, Mirah came in and made a real interruption. She (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) had not
taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) hat; and when Deronda rose and advanced to shake hands
with her (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) said, in a confusion at once unaccountable and
troublesome to herself--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only came in to see that Ezra had his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) new draught. I must go
directly to Mrs. Meyrick's to fetch something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray allow me to walk with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda urgently. <div class="bookquote">``I must not
tire Ezra any further; besides my brains are melting. I want to go to
Mrs. Meyrick's: may I go with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div>said Mirah, blushing still more, with the vague sense of
something new in Deronda, and turning away to pour out Ezra's draught;
Ezra meanwhile throwing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) head with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) eyes shut, unable to get
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) mind away from the ideas that had been filling it while the reading
was going on. Deronda for a moment stood thinking of nothing but the
walk, till Mirah turned round again and brought the draught, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
suddenly remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) cravat, and
saying--<div class="bookquote">``Pray excuse my dishabille--I did not mean you to see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
went to the little table, took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) cravat, and exclaimed with a
violent impulse of surprise, <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens, where is my ring gone?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>beginning to search about on the floor.

<p/>Ezra looked round the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) chair. Mirah, quick as thought,
went to the spot where Deronda was seeking, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Did you lay it
down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, still unvisited by any other explanation than that
the ring had fallen and was lurking in shadow, indiscernable on the
variegated carpet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was moving the bits of furniture near, and
searching in all possible and impossible places with hand and eyes.

<p/>But another explanation had visited Mirah and taken the color from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>)
cheeks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) went to Ezra's ear and whispered <div class="bookquote">``Was my father here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) head in reply, meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) eyes with terrible understanding.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) darted back to the spot where Deronda was still casting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
eyes in that hopeless exploration which are apt to carry on over a
space we have examined in vain. <div class="bookquote">``You have not found it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) said,
hurriedly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) frightened gaze, immediately caught alarm from it and
answered, <div class="bookquote">``I perhaps put it in my pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>professing to feel for it
there.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``It is not there?--you put it on the table,''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>with a penetrating voice that would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) feign to have found it
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) pocket; and immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) rushed out of the room. Deronda
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) was gone into the sitting-room below to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>)
father--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) opened the door of the bedroom to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) were there--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>)
looked where his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hat usually hung--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) turned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) hands clasped
tight and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) lips pale, gazing despairingly out of the window. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) looked up at Deronda, who had not dared to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>)
white agitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), unable to utter a word--the look
seemed a tacit acceptance of the humiliation she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) presence.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) clasped hands between both his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), said, in a tone of
reverent adoration--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mirah, let me think that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is my father as well as yours--that we can
have no sorrow, no disgrace, no joy apart. I will rather take your
grief to be mine than I would take the brightest joy of another woman.
Say you will not reject me--say you will take me to share all things
with you. Say you will promise to be my wife--say it now. I have been
in doubt so long--I have had to hide my love so long. Say that now and
always I may prove to you that I love you with complete love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The change in Mirah had been gradual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) had not passed at once from
anguish to the full, blessed consciousness that, in this moment of
grief and shame, Deronda was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) the highest tribute man can
give to woman. With the first tones and the first words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) had only a
sense of solemn comfort, referring this goodness of Deronda's to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
feeling for Ezra. But by degrees the rapturous assurance of unhoped-for
good took possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) frame: her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) face glowed under Deronda's as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>); yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) looked up still with intense gravity, as when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) had first acknowledged with religious gratitude that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had thought
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``worthy of the best;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) could say
nothing--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) could only lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) lips to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and just kiss them, as
if that were the simplest <div class="bookquote">``yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They stood then, only looking at each
other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mirah</b></font>) hands between his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)--too happy to move, meeting so
fully in their new consciousness that all signs would have seemed to
throw them farther apart, till Mirah said in a whisper: <div class="bookquote">``Let us go and
comfort Ezra.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Mirah</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXIX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The human nature unto which I felt
That I belonged, and reverenced with love,
Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit
Diffused through time and space, with aid derived
Of evidence from monuments, erect,
Prostrate, or leaning toward their common rest
In earth, the widely scattered wreck sublime
Of vanished nations.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--WORDSWORTH: _The Prelude_.


<p/>Sir Hugo carried out his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) plan of spending part of the autumn at Diplow,
and by the beginning of October his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) presence was spreading some
cheerfulness in the neighborhood, among all ranks and persons
concerned, from the stately home of Brackenshaw and Quetcham to the
respectable shop-parlors in Wanchester. For Sir Hugo was a man who
liked to show himself and be affable, a Liberal of good lineage, who
confided entirely in reform as not likely to make any serious
difference in English habits of feeling, one of which undoubtedly is
the liking to behold society well fenced and adorned with hereditary
rank. Hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>) made Diplow a most agreeable house, extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>)
invitations to old Wanchester solicitors and young village curates, but
also taking some care in the combination of the guests, and not feeding
all the common poultry together, so that they should think their meal
no particular compliment. Easy-going Lord Brackenshaw, for example,
would not mind meeting Robinson the attorney, but Robinson would have
been naturally piqued if he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) had been asked to meet a set of people who
passed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) equals. On all these points Sir Hugo was well informed
enough at once to gain popularity for himself and give pleasure to
others--two results which eminently suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) disposition. The rector
of Pennicote now found a reception at Diplow very different from the
haughty tolerance he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had undergone during the reign of Grandcourt. It
was not that the baronet liked Mr. Gascoigne; it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) desired to
keep up a marked relation of friendliness with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) on account of Mrs.
Grandcourt, for whom Sir Hugo's chivalry had become more and more
engaged. Why? The chief reason was one that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) could not fully
communicate, even to Lady Mallinger--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) would not tell what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
thought one woman's secret to another, even though the other was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
wife--which shows that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) chivalry included a rare reticence.

<p/>Deronda, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had become engaged to Mirah, felt it right to make a
full statement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) position and purposes to Sir Hugo, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) chose
to make it by letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had more than a presentiment that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) fatherly
friend would feel some dissatisfaction, if not pain, at this turn of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) destiny. In reading unwelcome news, instead of hearing it, there is
the advantage that one avoids a hasty expression of impatience which
may afterward be repented of. Deronda dreaded that verbal collision
which makes otherwise pardonable feeling lastingly offensive.

<p/>And Sir Hugo, though not altogether surprised, was thoroughly vexed.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) immediate resource was to take the letter to Lady Mallinger, who
would be sure to express an astonishment which her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) husband could argue
against as unreasonable, and in this way divide the stress of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
discontent. And in fact when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) showed herself astonished and
distressed that all Daniel's wonderful talents, and the comfort of
having him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) in the house, should have ended in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) going mad in this way
about the Jews, the baronet could say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nonsense, my dear! depend upon it, Dan will not make a fool of
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) has large notions about Judaism--political views which you
can't understand. No fear but Dan will keep himself head uppermost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>But with regard to the prospective marriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) no
counter-irritant. The gentle lady observed, without rancor, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>)
had little dreamed of what was coming when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) had Mirah to sing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>)
musical party and give lessons to Amabel. After some hesitation,
indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) confessed it _had_ passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) mind that after a
proper time Daniel might marry Mrs. Grandcourt--because it seemed so
remarkable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) should be at Genoa just at that time--and although
she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) herself was not fond of widows she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) could not help thinking that
such a marriage would have been better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) going altogether with
the Jews. But Sir Hugo was so strongly of the same opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
could not correct it as a feminine mistake; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) ill-humor at the
disproof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) disagreeable conclusions on behalf of Gwendolen was
left without vent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) desired Lady Mallinger not to breathe a word
about the affair till further notice, saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``If it is an
unkind cut to the poor thing -LRB-meaning Gwendolen-RRB-, the longer she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) is
without knowing it the better, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) present nervous state. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
will best learn it from Dan himself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div>Sir Hugo's conjectures had worked
so industriously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) knowledge, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) fancied himself well
informed concerning the whole situation.

<p/>Meanwhile his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) residence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) family at Diplow enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) to
continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) fatherly attentions to Gwendolen; and in these Lady
Mallinger, notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mallinger</b></font>) small liking for widows, was quite
willing to second him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>).

<p/>The plan of removal to Offendene had been carried out; and Gwendolen,
in settling there, maintained a calm beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother's hopes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was
experiencing some of that peaceful melancholy which comes from the
renunciation of demands for self, and from taking the ordinary good of
existence, and especially kindness, even from a dog, as a gift above
expectation. Does one who has been all but lost in a pit of darkness
complain of the sweet air and the daylight? There is a way of looking
at our life daily as an escape, and taking the quiet return of morn and
evening--still more the star-like out-glowing of some pure
fellow-feeling, some generous impulse breaking our inward darkness--as
a salvation that reconciles us to hardship. Those who have a
self-knowledge prompting such self-accusation as Hamlet's, can
understand this habitual feeling of rescue. And it was felt by
Gwendolen as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) lived through and through again the terrible history
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) temptations, from their first form of illusory self-pleasing
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) struggled away from the hold of conscience, to their latest
form of an urgent hatred dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) toward its satisfaction, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) prayed and cried for the help of that conscience which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had once
forsaken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was now dwelling on every word of Deronda's that pointed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) past deliverance from the worst evil in herself, and the worst
infliction of it on others, and on every word that carried a force to
resist self-despair.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was also upborne by the prospect of soon seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) again: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
did not imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) otherwise than always within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) reach, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) supreme
need of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) blinding her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to the separateness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) life, the whole
scene of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) filled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--no unique
preoccupation of Gwendolen's, for we are all apt to fall into this
passionate egoism of imagination, not only toward our fellow-men, but
toward God. And the future which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face to with a willing
step was one where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would be continually assimilating herself to
some type that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would hold before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) not first risen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
vision as a corrective presence which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had recognized in the
beginning with resentment, and at last with entire love and trust? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
could not spontaneously think of an end to that reliance, which had
become to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imagination like the firmness of the earth, the only
condition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) walking.

<p/>And Deronda was not long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) came to Diplow, which was a more
convenient distance from town than the Abbey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had wished to carry
out a plan for taking Ezra and Mirah to a mild spot on the coast, while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) prepared another home which Mirah might enter as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) bride, and
where they might unitedly watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) brother. But Ezra begged not
to be removed, unless it were to go with them to the East. All outward
solicitations were becoming more and more of a burden to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>); but his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>)
mind dwelt on the possibility of this voyage with a visionary joy.
Deronda, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) preparations for the marriage, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hoped might not
be deferred beyond a couple of months, wished to have fuller
consultation as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) resources and affairs generally with Sir Hugo,
and here was a reason for not delaying his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) visit to Diplow. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
thought quite as much of another reason--his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) promise to Gwendolen. The
sense of blessedness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own lot had yet an aching anxiety at his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
heart: this may be held paradoxical, for the beloved lover is always
called happy, and happiness is considered as a well-fleshed
indifference to sorrow outside it. But human experience is usually
paradoxical, if that means incongruous with the phrases of current talk
or even current philosophy. It was no treason to Mirah, but a part of
that full nature which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) the more worthy, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
joy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could hold by its side the care for another. For what is
love itself, for the one we love best?--an enfolding of immeasurable
cares which yet are better than any joys outside our love.

<p/>Deronda came twice to Diplow, and saw Gwendolen twice--and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went
back to town without having told her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) anything about the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
lot and prospects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) blamed himself; but in all momentous
communication likely to give pain we feel dependent on some preparatory
turn of words or associations, some agreement of the other's mood with
the probable effect of what we have to impart. In the first interview
Gwendolen was so absorbed in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), so full of
questions which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) must answer, about the arrangement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life, what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could do to make herself less ignorant, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could be kindest to
everybody, and make amends for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) selfishness and try to be rid of it,
that Deronda utterly shrank from waiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) immediate wants in order
to speak of himself, nay, from inflicting a wound on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in these
moments when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was leaning on him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) for help in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) path. In the second
interview, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went with new resolve to command the conversation
into some preparatory track, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) in a state of deep
depression, overmastered by some distasteful miserable memories which
forced themselves on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) as something more real and ample than any new
material out of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could mould her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) future. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cried
hysterically, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) would always despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could only
seek words of soothing and encouragement: and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) gradually
revived under them, with that pathetic look of renewed childlike
interest which we see in eyes where the lashes are still beaded with
tears, it was impossible to lay another burden on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).

<p/>But time went on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt it a pressing duty to make the difficult
disclosure. Gwendolen, it was true, never recognized his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) having any
affairs; and it had never even occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
happened to be at Genoa. But this unconsciousness of hers would make a
sudden revelation of affairs that were determining his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) course in life
all the heavier blow to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) left the revelation to be made
by different persons, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) would feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with cruel
inconsiderateness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not make the communication in writing: his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
tenderness could not bear to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) virtual farewell
in solitude, and perhaps feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) words full of a hard gladness for
himself and indifference for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) went down to Diplow again, feeling
that every other peril was to be incurred rather than that of returning
and leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) still in ignorance.

<p/>On this third visit Deronda found Hans Meyrick installed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) easel
at Diplow, beginning his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) picture of the three daughters sitting on a
bank, <div class="bookquote">``in the Gainsborough style,''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughters</b></font>)</div>and varying his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) work by rambling to
Pennicote to sketch the village children and improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) acquaintance
with the Gascoignes. Hans appeared to have recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) vivacity, but
Deronda detected some feigning in it, as we detect the artificiality of
a lady's bloom from its being a little too high-toned and steadily
persistent -LRB-a <div class="bookquote">``Fluctuating Rouge''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>not having yet appeared among the
advertisements-RRB-. Also with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) grateful friendship and admiration
for Deronda, Hans could not help a certain irritation against him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>), such
as extremely incautious, open natures are apt to feel when the breaking
of a friend's reserve discloses a state of things not merely
unsuspected but the reverse of what had been hoped and ingeniously
conjectured. It is true that poor Hans had always cared chiefly to
confide in Deronda, and had been quite incurious as to any confidence
that might have been given in return; but what outpourer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) own
affairs is not tempted to think any hint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) friend's affairs is an
egotistic irrelevance? That was no reason why it was not rather a sore
reflection to Hans that while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had been all along naively opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
heart about Mirah, Deronda had kept secret a feeling of rivalry which
now revealed itself as the important determining fact. Moreover, it is
always at their peril that our friends turn out to be something more
than we were aware of. Hans must be excused for these promptings of
bruised sensibility, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had not allowed them to govern his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
substantial conduct: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had the consciousness of having done right by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) fortunate friend; or, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) told himself, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) metal had given a
better ring than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) would have sworn to beforehand.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For Hans had
always said that in point of virtue he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was a _dilettante_: which meant
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was very fond of it in other people, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) meddled with it
himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) cut a poor figure. Perhaps in reward of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) good behavior he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) tongue the more freedom; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was too fully possessed by the
notion of Deronda's happiness to have a conception of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was
feeling about Gwendolen, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) without hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did you come down, Hans?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, joining him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) in the
grounds where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was making a study of the requisite bank and trees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ten days ago; before the time Sir Hugo fixed. I ran down with Rex
Gascoigne and stayed at the rectory a day or two. I'm up in all the
gossip of these parts; I know the state of the wheelwright's interior,
and have assisted at an infant school examination. Sister Anna, with
the good upper lip, escorted me, else I should have been mobbed by
three urchins and an idiot, because of my long hair and a general
appearance which departs from the Pennicote type of the beautiful.
Altogether, the village is idyllic. Its only fault is a dark curate
with broad shoulders and broad trousers who ought to have gone into the
heavy drapery line. The Gascoignes are perfect--besides being related
to the Vandyke duchess. I caught a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) black robes at
a distance, though she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) doesn't show to visitors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) was not staying at the rectory?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I was taken to Offendene to see the old house, and as a
consequence I saw the duchess' family. I suppose you have been there
and know all about them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have been there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fine old place. An excellent setting for a widow with romantic
fortunes. And she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) seems to have had several romances. I think I have
found out that there was one between her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) and my friend Rex.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not long before her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) marriage, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, really interested,
<div class="bookquote">``for they had only been a year at Offendene. How came you to know
anything of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--not ignorant of what it is to be a miserable devil, I learn to
gloat on the signs of misery in others. I found out that Rex never goes
to Offendene, and has never seen the duchess since she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) came back; and
Miss Gascoigne let fall something in our talk about charade-acting--for
I went through some of my nonsense to please the young ones--something
that proved to me that Rex was once hovering about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) fair cousin
close enough to get singed. I don't know what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) part in the
affair. Perhaps the duke came in and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) off. That is always
the way when an exceptionally worthy young man forms an attachment. I
understand now why Gascoigne talks of making the law his (<font color='blue'><b>Gascoigne</b></font>) mistress and
remaining a bachelor. But these are green resolves. Since the duke did
not get himself drowned for your sake, it may turn out to be for my
friend Rex's sake. Who knows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it absolutely necessary that Mrs. Grandcourt should marry again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, ready to add that Hans's success in constructing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
fortunes hitherto had not been enough to warrant a new attempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You monster!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>retorted Hans, <div class="bookquote">``do you want her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) to wear weeds for _you_
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) life--burn herself in perpetual suttee while you are alive and
merry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda could say nothing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) looked so much annoyed that Hans
turned the current of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) chat, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was alone shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
shoulders a little over the thought that there really had been some
stronger feeling between Deronda and the duchess than Mirah would like
to know of. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) fall in love with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Meyrick/Hans Meyrick</b></font>)</div>thought Hans,
laughing at himself. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) would have had no rivals. No woman ever
wanted to discuss theology with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>No wonder that Deronda winced under that sort of joking with a
whip-lash. It touched sensibilities that were already quivering with
the anticipation of witnessing some of that pain to which even Hans's
light words seemed to give more reality:--any sort of recognition by
another giving emphasis to the subject of our anxiety. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had
come down with the firm resolve that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) would not again evade the
trial. The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) rode to Offendene. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had sent word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
intended to call and to ask if Gwendolen could receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) in the old drawing-room where some chief crises
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) life had happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seemed less sad than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
since her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) husband's death; there was no smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face, but a placid
self-possession, in contrast with the mood in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had last found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was all the more alive to the sadness perceptible in Deronda;
and they were no sooner seated--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) at a little distance opposite to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)--than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were afraid of coming to see me, because I was so full of grief
and despair the last time. But I am not so today. I have been sorry
ever since. I have been making it a reason why I should keep up my hope
and be as cheerful as I can, because I would not give you any pain
about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an unwonted sweetness in Gwendolen's tone and look as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
uttered these words that seemed to Deronda to infuse the utmost cruelty
into the task now laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt obliged to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answer
a beginning of the task.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I _am_ in some trouble to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) rather
mournfully; <div class="bookquote">``but it is because I have things to tell you which you will
almost think it a want of confidence on my part not to have spoken of
before. They are things affecting my own life--my own future. I shall
seem to have made an ill return to you for the trust you have placed in
me--never to have given you an idea of events that make great changes
for me. But when we have been together we have hardly had time to enter
into subjects which at the moment were really less pressing to me than
the trials you have been going through.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There was a sort of timid
tenderness in Deronda's deep tones, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) paused with a pleading look,
as if it had been Gwendolen only who had conferred anything in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
scenes of beseeching and confession.

<p/>A thrill of surprise was visible in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Such meaning as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) found in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) words had shaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), but without causing fear. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind had flown
at once to some change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) position with regard to Sir Hugo and Sir
Hugo's property. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, with a sense of comfort from Deronda's way
of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) pardon--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never thought of anything but what you could do to help me; and I
was so troublesome. How could you tell me things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will perhaps astonish you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``that I have only quite
lately known who were my parents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen was not astonished: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt the more assured that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
expectations of what was coming were right. Deronda went on without
check.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The reason why you found me in Italy was that I had gone there to
learn that--in fact, to meet my mother. It was by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wish that I was
brought up in ignorance of my parentage. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) parted with me after my
father's death, when I was a little creature. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is now very ill,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt that the secrecy ought not to be any longer maintained.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chief reason had been that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not wish me to know I was a Jew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_A Jew_!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>Gwendolen exclaimed, in a low tone of amazement, with an
utterly frustrated look, as if some confusing potion were creeping
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) system.

<p/>Deronda colored, and did not speak, while Gwendolen, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes
fixed on the floor, was struggling to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) way in the dark by the
aid of various reminiscences. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) seemed at last to have arrived at
some judgment, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked up at Deronda again and said, as if
remonstrating against the mother's conduct--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What difference need that have made?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has made a great difference to me that I have known it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said
Deronda, emphatically; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not go on easily--the distance
between her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ideas and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) acted like a difference of native language,
making him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) uncertain what force his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) words would carry.

<p/>Gwendolen meditated again, and then said feelingly, <div class="bookquote">``I hope there is
nothing to make you mind. _You_ are just the same as if you were not a
Jew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) meant to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) that nothing of that external sort could affect
the way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), or the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could
influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Deronda was a little helped by this misunderstanding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The discovery was far from being painful to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I had been
gradually prepared for it, and I was glad of it. I had been prepared
for it by becoming intimate with a very remarkable Jew, whose ideas
have attracted me so much that I think of devoting the best part of my
life to some effort at giving them effect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Gwendolen seemed shaken--again there was a look of frustration,
but this time it was mingled with alarm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked at Deronda with
lips childishly parted. It was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had yet connected his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) words
with Mirah and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) brother, but that they had inspired her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with a
dreadful presentiment of mountainous travel for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind before it
could reach Deronda's. Great ideas in general which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had attributed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) seemed to make no great practical difference, and were not
formidable in the same way as these mysteriously-shadowed particular
ideas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not quite divine what was going on within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could
only seek the least abrupt path of disclosure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is an object,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said, after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``which will by-and-by
force me to leave England for some time--for some years. I have
purposes which will take me to the East.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Here was something clearer, but all the more immediately agitating.
Gwendolen's lips began to tremble. <div class="bookquote">``But you will come back?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said,
tasting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own tears as they fell, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) thought of drying them.

<p/>Deronda could not sit still. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) rose, and went to prop himself against
the corner of the mantel-piece, at a different angle from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face. But
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) handkerchief against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cheeks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned
and looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), awaiting an answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I live,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda--<div class="bookquote">''_some time_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not persuade himself to say more unless
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) led up to it by a question; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was apparently meditating
something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) asked, at last, very mildly. <div class="bookquote">``Can I
understand the ideas, or am I too ignorant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to the East to become better acquainted with the condition
of my race in various countries there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, gently--anxious
to be as explanatory as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could on what was the impersonal part of
their separateness from each other. <div class="bookquote">``The idea that I am possessed with
is that of restoring a political existence to my people, making them a
nation again, giving them a national center, such as the English have,
though they too are scattered over the face of the globe. That is a
task which presents itself to me as a duty; I am resolved to begin it,
however feebly. I am resolved to devote my life to it. At the least, I
may awaken a movement in other minds, such as has been awakened in my
own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a long silence between them. The world seemed getting larger
round poor Gwendolen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) more solitary and helpless in the midst.
The thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might come back after going to the East, sank
before the bewildering vision of these wild-stretching purposes in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt herself reduced to a mere speck. There comes a terrible
moment to many souls when the great movements of the world, the larger
destinies of mankind, which have lain aloof in newspapers and other
neglected reading, enter like an earthquake into their own lives--where
the slow urgency of growing generations turns into the tread of an
invading army or the dire clash of civil war, and gray fathers know
nothing to seek for but the corpses of their blooming sons, and girls
forget all vanity to make lint and bandages which may serve for the
shattered limbs of their betrothed husbands. Then it is as if the
Invisible Power that had been the object of lip-worship and
lip-resignation became visible, according to the imagery of the Hebrew
poet, making the flames his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) chariot, and riding on the wings of the
wind, till the mountains smoke and the plains shudder under the rolling
fiery visitations. Often the good cause seems to lie prostrate under
the thunder of relenting force, the martyrs live reviled, they die, and
no angel is seen holding forth the crown and the palm branch. Then it
is that the submission of the soul to the Highest is tested, and even
in the eyes of frivolity life looks out from the scene of human
struggle with the awful face of duty, and a religion shows itself which
is something else than a private consolation.

<p/>That was the sort of crisis which was at this moment beginning in
Gwendolen's small life: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was for the first time feeling the pressure
of a vast mysterious movement, for the first time being dislodged from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) supremacy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own world, and getting a sense that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) horizon
was but a dipping onward of an existence with which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) own was
revolving. All the troubles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wifehood and widowhood had still
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with the implicit impression which had accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from
childhood, that whatever surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was somehow specially for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>),
and it was because of this that no personal jealousy had been roused in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) relation to Deronda: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not spontaneously think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as
rightfully belonging to others more than to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). But here had come a
shock which went deeper than personal jealousy--something spiritual and
vaguely tremendous that thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) away, and yet quelled all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) anger
into self-humiliation.

<p/>There had been a long silence. Deronda had stood still, even thankful
for an interval before he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) needed to say more, and Gwendolen had sat
like a statue with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wrists lying over each other and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes
fixed--the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mental action arresting all other
excitation. At length something occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
face to Deronda and say in a trembling voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all you can tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>The question was like a dart to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The Jew whom I mentioned just
now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) answered, not without a certain tremor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tones too, <div class="bookquote">``the
remarkable man who has greatly influenced my mind, has not perhaps been
totally unheard of by you. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is the brother of Miss Lapidoth, whom you
have often heard sing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A great wave of remembrance passed through Gwendolen and spread as a
deep, painful flush over neck and face. It had come first at the scene
of that morning when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had called on Mirah, and heard Deronda's voice
reading, and been told, without then heeding it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was reading
Hebrew with Mirah's brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very ill--very near death now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda went on, nervously, and
then stopped short. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) must wait. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) divine the
rest?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>) tell you that I went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lapidoth</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen, abruptly,
looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda. <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes again, and sat thinking. Slowly the color
dried out of face and neck, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was as pale as before--with that
almost withered paleness which is seen after a painful flush. At last
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said--without turning toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)--in a low, measured voice, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) were only thinking aloud in preparation for future speech--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But _can_ you marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>said Deronda, also in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>At first there was no change in Gwendolen's attitude: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) only began to
tremble visibly; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) looked before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) with dilated eyes, as at
something lying in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) stretched her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) arms out
straight, and cried with a smothered voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said I should be forsaken. I have been a cruel woman. And I am
forsaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Deronda's anguish was intolerable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) could not help himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) seized
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) outstretched hands and held them together, and kneeled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) feet.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was the victim of his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am cruel, too, I am cruel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) repeated, with a sort of groan,
looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) imploringly.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) presence and touch seemed to dispel a horrible vision, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) met
his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) upward look of sorrow with something like the return of
consciousness after fainting. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) dwelt on it with that growing
pathetic movement of the brow which accompanies the revival of some
tender recollection. The look of sorrow brought back what seemed a very
far-off moment--the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had ever seen it, in the library at
the Abbey. Sobs rose, and great tears fell fast. Deronda would not let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands go--held them still with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and himself pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
handkerchief against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) submitted like a half-soothed child,
making an effort to speak, which was hindered by struggling sobs. At
last she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) succeeded in saying, brokenly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said--I said--it should be better--better with me--for having known
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) eyes too were larger with tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) wrested one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) action, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) tears away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall not be quite parted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I will write to you always,
when I can, and you will answer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) waited till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I will try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be more with you than I used to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div>Deronda said with gentle
urgency, releasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) hands and rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) kneeling posture. <div class="bookquote">``If
we had been much together before, we should have felt our differences
more, and seemed to get farther apart. Now we can perhaps never see
each other again. But our minds may get nearer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div><p/>Gwendolen said nothing, but rose too, automatically. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) withered look
of grief, such as the sun often shines on when the blinds are drawn up
after the burial of life's joy, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hate his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) own words: they
seemed to have the hardness of easy consolation in them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) felt that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was going, and that nothing could hinder it. The sense of it was
like a dreadful whisper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) ear, which dulled all other
consciousness; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had not known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was rising.

<p/>Deronda could not speak again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) thought that they must part in
silence, but it was difficult to move toward the parting, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) with a sort of intention in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) eyes, which helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) advanced to put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) hand silently, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had placed hers
within it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said what her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mind had been laboring with--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been very good to me. I have deserved nothing. I will
try--try to live. I shall think of you. What good have I been? Only
harm. Don't let me be harm to _you_. It shall be the better for me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could not finish. It was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was sobbing, but that the
intense effort with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) spoke made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) too tremulous. The burden
of that difficult rectitude toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was a weight her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) frame tottered
under.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) bent forward to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) cheek, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) kissed hers. Then they
looked at each other for an instant with clasped hands, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) turned
away.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was quite gone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother came in and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) sitting
motionless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gwendolen, dearest, you look very ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) said, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) and
touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) cold hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mamma. But don't be afraid. I am going to live,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gwendolen/Miss Gwendolen/GWENDOLEN</b></font>)</div>said Gwendolen,
bursting out hysterically.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) to go to bed, and watched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Through the
day and half the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) fell continually into fits of shrieking, but
cried in the midst of them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid. I shall
live. I mean to live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) slept; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) waked in the morning light, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
looked up fixedly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) mother and said tenderly, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor mamma! You
have been sitting up with me. Don't be unhappy. I shall live. I shall
be better.''




 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXX.

<p/>In the checkered area of human experience the seasons are all mingled
as in the golden age: fruit and blossom hang together; in the same
moment the sickle is reaping and the seed is sprinkled; one tends the
green cluster and another treads the winepress. Nay, in each of our
lives harvest and spring-time are continually one, until himself
gathers us and sows us anew in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) invisible fields.


<p/>Among the blessings of love there is hardly one more exquisite than the
sense that in uniting the beloved life to ours we can watch over its
happiness, bring comfort where hardship was, and over memories of
privation and suffering open the sweetest fountains of joy. Deronda's
love for Mirah was strongly imbued with that blessed protectiveness.
Even with infantine feet she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) had begun to tread among thorns; and the
first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) face it had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) the girlish
image of despair.

<p/>But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) was glowing like a dark-tipped yet delicate ivory-tinted
flower in the warm sunlight of content, thinking of any possible grief
as part of that life with Deronda, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) could call by no other
name than good. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) watched the sober gladness which gave new beauty
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) movements; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) habitual attitudes of repose, with a delight
which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) say to himself that it was enough of personal joy for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) from pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) knew nothing of Hans's struggle or of
Gwendolen's pang; for after the assurance that Deronda's hidden love
had been for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) easily explained Gwendolen's eager solicitude
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) as part of a grateful dependence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) goodness, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>)
herself had known. And all Deronda's words about Mrs. Grandcourt
confirmed that view of their relation, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) never touched on it
except in the most distant manner. Mirah was ready to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>)
had been a rescuing angel to many besides herself. The only wonder was,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandcourt</b></font>) among them all was to have the bliss of being continually by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) side.

<p/>So, when the bridal veil was around Mirah it hid no doubtful
tremors--only a thrill of awe at the acceptance of a great gift which
required great uses. And the velvet canopy never covered a more goodly
bride and bridegroom, to whom their people might more wisely wish
offspring; more truthful lips never touched the sacrament
marriage-wine; the marriage-blessing never gathered stronger promise of
fulfillment than in the integrity of their mutual pledge. Naturally,
they were married according to the Jewish rite. And since no religion
seems yet to have demanded that when we make a feast we should invite
only the highest rank of our acquaintances, few, it is to be hoped,
will be offended to learn that among the guests at Deronda's little
wedding-feast was the entire Cohen family, with the one exception of
the baby who carried on her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) teething intelligently at home. How could
Mordecai have borne that those friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) adversity should have
been shut out from rejoicing in common with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>)?

<p/>Mrs. Meyrick so fully understood this that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) had quite reconciled
herself to meeting the Jewish pawnbroker, and was there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meyrick</b></font>) three
daughters--all of them enjoying the consciousness that Mirah's marriage
to Deronda crowned a romance which would always make a sweet memory to
them. For which of them, mother or girls, had not had a generous part
in it--giving their best in feeling and in act to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) who needed? If
Hans could have been there, it would have been better; but Mab had
already observed that men must suffer for being so inconvenient;
suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Kate, and Amy had all fallen in love with Mr.
Deronda?--but being women they were not so ridiculous.

<p/>The Meyricks were rewarded for conquering their prejudices by hearing a
speech from Mr. Cohen, which had the rare quality among speeches of not
being quite after the usual pattern. Jacob ate beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) years, and
contributed several small whinnying laughs as a free accompaniment of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) father's speech, not irreverently, but from a lively sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
family was distinguishing itself; while Adelaide Rebekah, in a new
Sabbath frock, maintained throughout a grave air of responsibility.

<p/>Mordecai's brilliant eyes, sunken in their large sockets, dwelt on the
scene with the cherishing benignancy of a spirit already lifted into an
aloofness which nullified only selfish requirements and left sympathy
alive. But continually, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mordecai</b></font>) gaze had been traveling round on the
others, it returned to dwell on Deronda with a fresh gleam of trusting
affection.

<p/>The wedding-feast was humble, but Mirah was not without splendid
wedding-gifts. As soon as the betrothal had been known, there were
friends who had entertained graceful devices. Sir Hugo and Lady
Mallinger had taken trouble to provide a complete equipment for Eastern
travel, as well as a precious locket containing an inscription--<div class="bookquote">''_To
the bride of our dear Daniel Deronda all blessings. H. and L. M._''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Mallinger</b></font>)</div>The
Klesmers sent a perfect watch, also with a pretty inscription.

<p/>But something more precious than gold and gems came to Deronda from the
neighborhood of Diplow on the morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) marriage. It was a letter
containing these words:--

<p/>Do not think of me sorrowfully on your wedding-day. I have remembered
your words--that I may live to be one of the best of women, who
make others glad that they were born. I do not yet see how that can
be, but you know better than I. If it ever comes true, it will be
because you helped me. I only thought of myself, and I made you
grieve. It hurts me now to think of your grief. You must not grieve
any more for me. It is better--it shall be better with me because I
have known you.

<p/>GWENDOLEN GRANDCOURT.

<p/>The preparations for the departure of all three to the East began at
once; for Deronda could not deny Ezra's wish that they should set out
on the voyage forthwith, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) might go with them, instead of
detaining them to watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) had no belief that Ezra's life
would last through the voyage, for there were symptoms which seemed to
show that the last stage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) malady had set in. But Ezra himself had
said, <div class="bookquote">``Never mind where I die, so that I am with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ezra/Cohen/Ezra Cohen</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) did not set out with them. One morning early he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) said to Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``Do
not quit me to-day. I shall die before it is ended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda/Daniel/Daniel Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) chose to be dressed and sit up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) easy chair as usual, Deronda
and Mirah on each side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>), and for some hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) was unusually
silent, not even making the effort to speak, but looking at them
occasionally with eyes full of some restful meaning, as if to assure
them that while this remnant of breathing-time was difficult, he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) felt
an ocean of peace beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/>It was not till late in the afternoon, when the light was falling, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) took a hand of each in his (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) and said, looking at Deronda, <div class="bookquote">``Death is
coming to me as the divine kiss which is both parting and
reunion--which takes me from your bodily eyes and gives me full
presence in your soul. Where thou goest, Daniel, I shall go. Is it not
begun? Have I not breathed my soul into you? We shall live together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Deronda</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>) paused, and Deronda waited, thinking that there might be another
word for him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>). But slowly and with effort Ezra, pressing on their hands,
raised himself and uttered in Hebrew the confession of the divine
Unity, which long for generations has been on the lips of the dying
Israelite.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) sank back gently into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) chair, and did not speak again. But it was
some hours before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) had ceased to breathe, with Mirah's and Deronda's
arms around him (<font color='blue'><b>Deronda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail
Or knock the breast; no weakness, no contempt,
Dispraise or blame; nothing but well and fair,
And what may quiet us in a death so noble.''
