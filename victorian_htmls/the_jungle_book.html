<p/>Now Rann the Kite brings home the night
That Mang the Bat sets free--
The herds are shut in byre and hut
For loosed till dawn are we.
This is the hour of pride and power,
Talon and tush and claw.
Oh, hear the call!--Good hunting all
That keep the Jungle Law!
Night-Song in the Jungle

<p/>It was seven o’clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when
Father Wolf woke up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and
spread out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling
in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) big gray nose dropped across her (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>)
four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the
cave where they all lived. <div class="bookquote">``Augrh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>said Father Wolf. <div class="bookquote">``It is time to
hunt again.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with
a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: <div class="bookquote">``Good luck go with you, O
Chief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble
children that they may never forget the hungry in this world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India
despise Tabaqui because he (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) runs about making mischief, and telling
tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village
rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) too, because Tabaqui, more
than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) forgets
that he (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting
everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui
goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake
a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the
madness--and run.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enter, then, and look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>said Father Wolf stiffly, <div class="bookquote">``but there is no food
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For a wolf, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tabaqui</b></font>)</div>said Tabaqui, <div class="bookquote">``but for so mean a person as myself a
dry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log -LSB-the jackal people-RSB-,
to pick and choose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tabaqui</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) scuttled to the back of the cave, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>)
found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end
merrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All thanks for this good meal,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) said, licking his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``How
beautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And so young
too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings
are men from the beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tabaqui</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so
unlucky as to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) to see
Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable.

<p/>Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) had made, and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) said spitefully:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) hunting grounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) will hunt
among these hills for the next moon, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty
miles away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has no right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>Father Wolf began angrily--<div class="bookquote">``By the Law of the Jungle
he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has no right to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) quarters without due warning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) will
frighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to kill for
two, these days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) mother did not call him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) Lungri -LSB-the Lame One-RSB- for nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mother Wolf/Mother</b></font>)</div>said
Mother Wolf quietly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has been lame in one foot from his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) birth. That
is why he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has only killed cattle. Now the villagers of the Waingunga are
angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has come here to make our villagers angry.
They will scour the jungle for him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) is far away, and we and our
children must run when the grass is set alight. Indeed, we are very
grateful to Shere Khan!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) of your gratitude?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tabaqui</b></font>)</div>said Tabaqui.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>snapped Father Wolf. <div class="bookquote">``Out and hunt with thy master. Thou hast
done harm enough for one night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tabaqui</b></font>)</div>said Tabaqui quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Ye can hear Shere Khan below in the
thickets. I might have saved myself the message.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div><p/>Father Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a little
river he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has
caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>said Father Wolf. <div class="bookquote">``To begin a night's work with that noise!
Does he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) think that our buck are like his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) fat Waingunga bullocks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H’sh. It is neither bullock nor buck he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hunts to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mother Wolf/Mother</b></font>)</div>said Mother
Wolf. <div class="bookquote">``It is Man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come
from every quarter of the compass. It was the noise that bewilders
woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run
sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>said Father Wolf, showing all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) white teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Faugh! Are there
not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) must eat Man, and on
our ground too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Man</b></font>)</div><p/>The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason,
forbids every beast to eat Man except when he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is killing to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>)
children how to kill, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) must hunt outside the hunting grounds
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) pack or tribe. The real reason for this is that man-killing
means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with
guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches.
Then everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason the beasts give among
themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living
things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>). They say too--and it is
true--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth.

<p/>The purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated <div class="bookquote">``Aaarh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>of the
tiger's charge.

<p/>Then there was a howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere Khan. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) has
missed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mother Wolf/Mother</b></font>)</div>said Mother Wolf. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div><p/>Father Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere Khan muttering and
mumbling savagely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) tumbled about in the scrub.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutter's campfire,
and has burned his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) feet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>said Father Wolf with a grunt. <div class="bookquote">``Tabaqui is
with him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something is coming uphill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mother Wolf/Mother</b></font>)</div>said Mother Wolf, twitching one ear. <div class="bookquote">``Get
ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div><p/>The bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf dropped
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) haunches under him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>), ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) leap. Then, if you had been
watching, you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the world--the
wolf checked in mid-spring. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) bound before he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) saw what it was
he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) was jumping at, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) tried to stop himself. The result was
that he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) shot up straight into the air for four or five feet, landing
almost where he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) left ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Man!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) snapped. <div class="bookquote">``A man's cub. Look!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Directly in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>), holding on by a low branch, stood a naked
brown baby who could just walk--as soft and as dimpled a little atom
as ever came to a wolf's cave at night. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) looked up into Father Wolf's
face, and laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that a man's cub?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mother Wolf/Mother</b></font>)</div>said Mother Wolf. <div class="bookquote">``I have never seen one. Bring
it here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A Wolf</b></font>)</div><p/>A Wolf accustomed to moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg
without breaking it, and though Father Wolf's jaws closed right on the
child's back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) laid it down
among the cubs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How little! How naked, and--how bold!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mother Wolf/Mother</b></font>)</div>said Mother Wolf softly. The
baby was pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide.
<div class="bookquote">``Ahai! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is taking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meal with the others. And so this is a man's
cub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man's cub among
her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or in
my time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>said Father Wolf. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) is altogether without hair, and I
could kill him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) with a touch of my foot. But see, he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) looks up and is not
afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div><p/>The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khan's
great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance. Tabaqui,
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>), was squeaking: <div class="bookquote">``My lord, my lord, it went in here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shere Khan does us great honor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>said Father Wolf, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) eyes were
very angry. <div class="bookquote">``What does Shere Khan need?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My quarry. A man's cub went this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div>said Shere Khan. <div class="bookquote">``Its parents
have run off. Give it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Shere Khan had jumped at a woodcutter's campfire, as Father Wolf had
said, and was furious from the pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) burned feet. But Father Wolf
knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in
by. Even where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) was, Shere Khan's shoulders and forepaws were cramped
for want of room, as a man's would be if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to fight in a barrel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Wolves are a free people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>said Father Wolf. <div class="bookquote">``They take orders from
the Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle-killer. The man's
cub is ours--to kill if we choose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choosing? By the
bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dog's den for my fair
dues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The tiger's roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself
clear of the cubs and sprang forward, her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) eyes, like two green moons in
the darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it is I, Raksha -LSB-The Demon-RSB-, who answers. The man's cub is mine,
Lungri--mine to me! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall not be killed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall live to run with
the Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and in the end, look you, hunter of
little naked cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) shall hunt thee! Now get
hence, or by the Sambhur that I killed -LRB-I eat no starved cattle-RRB-, back
thou goest to thy mother, burned beast of the jungle, lamer than ever
thou camest into the world! Go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div><p/>Father Wolf looked on amazed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) had almost forgotten the days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>)
won Mother Wolf in fair fight from five other wolves, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) ran in
the Pack and was not called The Demon for compliment's sake. Shere Khan
might have faced Father Wolf, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) could not stand up against Mother
Wolf, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) knew that where he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) was she (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had all the advantage of the
ground, and would fight to the death. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) backed out of the cave mouth
growling, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) was clear he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) shouted:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Each dog barks in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) own yard! We will see what the Pack will say to
this fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and to my teeth he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) will
come in the end, O bush-tailed thieves!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, and Father Wolf
said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) gravely:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shere Khan speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown to the Pack.
Wilt thou still keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>), Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) came naked, by night, alone and very hungry;
yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) was not afraid! Look, he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has pushed one of my babes to one side
already. And that lame butcher would have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) and would have run
off to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our
lairs in revenge! Keep him (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>)? Assuredly I will keep him (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>). Lie still, little
frog. O thou Mowgli--for Mowgli the Frog I will call thee--the time will
come when thou wilt hunt Shere Khan as he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has hunted thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what will our Pack say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>said Father Wolf.

<p/>The Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may, when he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>)
marries, withdraw from the Pack he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) belongs to. But as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) cubs
are old enough to stand on their feet he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) must bring them to the Pack
Council, which is generally held once a month at full moon, in order
that the other wolves may identify them. After that inspection the cubs
are free to run where they please, and until they have killed their
first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the Pack kills one
of them. The punishment is death where the murderer can be found; and if
you think for a minute you will see that this must be so.

<p/>Father Wolf waited till his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) cubs could run a little, and then on the
night of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the
Council Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred
wolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack
by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) rock, and
below him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from
badger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black
three-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone Wolf had led them for a
year now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) youth, and once he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>)
had been beaten and left for dead; so he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) knew the manners and customs
of men. There was very little talking at the Rock. The cubs tumbled over
each other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers
sat, and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look
at him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) carefully, and return to his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) place on noiseless feet. Sometimes a
mother would push her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that
he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) had not been overlooked. Akela from his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) rock would cry: <div class="bookquote">``Ye know
the Law--ye know the Law. Look well, O Wolves!''  (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div>And the anxious mothers
would take up the call: <div class="bookquote">``Look--look well, O Wolves!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mothers</b></font>)</div><p/>At last--and Mother Wolf's neck bristles lifted as the time came--Father
Wolf pushed <div class="bookquote">``Mowgli the Frog,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>as they called him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>), into the center,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in
the moonlight.

<p/>Akela never raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) head from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) paws, but went on with the
monotonous cry: <div class="bookquote">``Look well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div>A muffled roar came up from behind the
rocks--the voice of Shere Khan crying: <div class="bookquote">``The cub is mine. Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) to
me. What have the Free People to do with a man's cub?''  (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div>Akela never even
twitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) ears. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) said was: <div class="bookquote">``Look well, O Wolves! What have
the Free People to do with the orders of any save the Free People? Look
well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) fourth year
flung back Shere Khan's question to Akela: <div class="bookquote">``What have the Free People to
do with a man's cub?''  (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div>Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there
is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>)
must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>)
father and mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who speaks for this cub?''  (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div>said Akela. <div class="bookquote">``Among the Free People who
speaks?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mother Wolf/Mother</b></font>)</div>There was no answer and Mother Wolf got ready for what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew
would be her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last fight, if things came to fighting.

<p/>Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council--Baloo,
the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle:
old Baloo, who can come and go where he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) pleases because he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) eats only
nuts and roots and honey--rose upon his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) hind quarters and grunted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man's cub--the man's cub?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I speak for the man's cub.
There is no harm in a man's cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak
the truth. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I
myself will teach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We need yet another,''  (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div>said Akela. <div class="bookquote">``Baloo has spoken, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is our
teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black
Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing
up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew
Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) path; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) was as cunning as
Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded
elephant. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree,
and a skin softer than down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Akela, and ye the Free People,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) purred, <div class="bookquote">``I have no right in your
assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which
is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may
be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay
that price. Am I right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>the wolves</b></font>)</div>said the young wolves, who are always hungry. <div class="bookquote">``Listen to
Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak then,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried twenty voices.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may make better sport for you
when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is grown. Baloo has spoken in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) behalf. Now to Baloo's word
I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly killed, not half a mile
from here, if ye will accept the man's cub according to the Law. Is it
difficult?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: <div class="bookquote">``What matter? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will
die in the winter rains. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will scorch in the sun. What harm can
a naked frog do us? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) run with the Pack. Where is the bull,
Bagheera? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be accepted.''  (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div>And then came Akela's deep bay, crying:
<div class="bookquote">``Look well--look well, O Wolves!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) did not notice
when the wolves came and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) one by one. At last they all went
down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and
Mowgli's own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, roar well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) whiskers, <div class="bookquote">``for the time will
come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I
know nothing of man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was well done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div>said Akela. <div class="bookquote">``Men and their cubs are very wise. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
may be a help in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack
forever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera.

<p/>Akela said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was thinking of the time that comes to every
leader of every pack when his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) strength goes from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) gets feebler
and feebler, till at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) is killed by the wolves and a new leader
comes up--to be killed in his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) said to Father Wolf, <div class="bookquote">``and train him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as befits one of
the Free People.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div><p/>And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the
price of a bull and on Baloo's good word.

<p/>Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only
guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves,
because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was a child. And Father Wolf taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) business, and the
meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every
breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) head,
every scratch of a bat's claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and
every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) as the work of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) office means to a business man. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) was
not learning he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep
again. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) felt dirty or hot he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) swam in the forest pools; and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) wanted honey -LRB-Baloo told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) that honey and nuts were just as
pleasant to eat as raw meat-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) climbed up for it, and that Bagheera
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) how to do. Bagheera would lie out on a branch and call, <div class="bookquote">``Come
along, Little Brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>and at first Mowgli would cling like the sloth,
but afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) would fling himself through the branches almost as
boldly as the gray ape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) place at the Council Rock, too,
when the Pack met, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) discovered that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) stared hard at any
wolf, the wolf would be forced to drop his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) eyes, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) used to stare
for fun. At other times he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) would pick the long thorns out of the pads
of his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) friends, for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their
coats. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night,
and look very curiously at the villagers in their huts, but he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) had a
mistrust of men because Bagheera showed him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) a square box with a drop
gate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) nearly walked into it,
and told him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) that it was a trap. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) loved better than anything else to
go with Bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest, to sleep all
through the drowsy day, and at night see how Bagheera did his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>)
killing. Bagheera killed right and left as he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) felt hungry, and so did
Mowgli--with one exception. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was old enough to understand
things, Bagheera told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) must never touch cattle because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had
been bought into the Pack at the price of a bull's life. <div class="bookquote">``All the jungle
is thine,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, <div class="bookquote">``and thou canst kill everything that thou art
strong enough to kill; but for the sake of the bull that bought thee
thou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old. That is the Law of
the Jungle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>Mowgli obeyed faithfully.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) is learning any lessons, and who has nothing in the world to think of
except things to eat.

<p/>Mother Wolf told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) once or twice that Shere Khan was not a creature
to be trusted, and that some day he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) must kill Shere Khan. But though a
young wolf would have remembered that advice every hour, Mowgli forgot
it because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was only a boy--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) would have called himself a wolf
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had been able to speak in any human tongue.

<p/>Shere Khan was always crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) path in the jungle, for as Akela grew
older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends with the
younger wolves of the Pack, who followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) for scraps, a thing Akela
would never have allowed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) had dared to push his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) authority to the
proper bounds. Then Shere Khan would flatter them and wonder that such
fine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a man's
cub. <div class="bookquote">``They tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div>Shere Khan would say, <div class="bookquote">``that at Council ye dare
not look him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) between the eyes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div>And the young wolves would growl and
bristle.

<p/>Bagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something of this, and
once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) told Mowgli in so many words that Shere Khan would kill
him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) some day. Mowgli would laugh and answer: <div class="bookquote">``I have the Pack and I have
thee; and Baloo, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) is so lazy, might strike a blow or two for my
sake. Why should I be afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>It was one very warm day that a new notion came to Bagheera--born of
something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had heard. Perhaps Ikki the Porcupine had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>);
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said to Mowgli when they were deep in the jungle, as the boy lay
with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head on Bagheera's beautiful black skin, <div class="bookquote">``Little Brother, how
often have I told thee that Shere Khan is thy enemy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As many times as there are nuts on that palm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, who,
naturally, could not count. <div class="bookquote">``What of it? I am sleepy, Bagheera, and
Shere Khan is all long tail and loud talk--like Mao, the Peacock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this is no time for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it; the Pack
know it; and even the foolish, foolish deer know. Tabaqui has told thee
too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho! ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``Tabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude
talk that I was a naked man's cub and not fit to dig pig-nuts. But I
caught Tabaqui by the tail and swung him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) twice against a palm-tree to
teach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) better manners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was foolishness, for though Tabaqui is a mischief-maker, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
have told thee of something that concerned thee closely. Open those
eyes, Little Brother. Shere Khan dare not kill thee in the jungle. But
remember, Akela is very old, and soon the day comes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) cannot kill
his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) buck, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) will be leader no more. Many of the wolves that
looked thee over when thou wast brought to the Council first are old
too, and the young wolves believe, as Shere Khan has taught them, that
a man-cub has no place with the Pack. In a little time thou wilt be a
man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is a man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should not run with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brothers?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said
Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``I was born in the jungle. I have obeyed the Law of the Jungle,
and there is no wolf of ours from whose paws I have not pulled a thorn.
Surely they are my brothers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Bagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Little Brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``feel under my jaw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) strong brown hand, and just under Bagheera's silky
chin, where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy hair,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) came upon a little bald spot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no one in the jungle that knows that I, Bagheera, carry that
mark--the mark of the collar; and yet, Little Brother, I was born among
men, and it was among men that my mother died--in the cages of the
king's palace at Oodeypore. It was because of this that I paid the price
for thee at the Council when thou wast a little naked cub. Yes, I too
was born among men. I had never seen the jungle. They fed me behind
bars from an iron pan till one night I felt that I was Bagheera--the
Panther--and no man's plaything, and I broke the silly lock with one
blow of my paw and came away. And because I had learned the ways of men,
I became more terrible in the jungle than Shere Khan. Is it not so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, <div class="bookquote">``all the jungle fear Bagheera--all except Mowgli.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thou art a man's cub,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Black Panther very tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``And
even as I returned to my jungle, so thou must go back to men at last--to
the men who are thy brothers--if thou art not killed in the Council.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why--but why should any wish to kill me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera. And Mowgli looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) steadily between
the eyes. The big panther turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head away in half a minute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said, shifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) paw on the leaves. <div class="bookquote">``Not even I can
look thee between the eyes, and I was born among men, and I love thee,
Little Brother. The others they hate thee because their eyes cannot meet
thine; because thou art wise; because thou hast pulled out thorns from
their feet--because thou art a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli sullenly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) frowned
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) heavy black eyebrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the Law of the Jungle? Strike first and then give tongue. By
thy very carelessness they know that thou art a man. But be wise. It is
in my heart that when Akela misses his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next kill--and at each hunt
it costs him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more to pin the buck--the Pack will turn against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and
against thee. They will hold a jungle Council at the Rock, and then--and
then--I have it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, leaping up. <div class="bookquote">``Go thou down quickly to
the men's huts in the valley, and take some of the Red Flower which they
grow there, so that when the time comes thou mayest have even a stronger
friend than I or Baloo or those of the Pack that love thee. Get the Red
Flower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>no creature</b></font>)</div><p/>By Red Flower Bagheera meant fire, only no creature in the jungle will
call fire by its proper name. Every beast lives in deadly fear of it,
and invents a hundred ways of describing it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Red Flower?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``That grows outside their huts in the
twilight. I will get some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There speaks the man's cub,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera proudly. <div class="bookquote">``Remember that it
grows in little pots. Get one swiftly, and keep it by thee for time of
need.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``I go. But art thou sure, O my Bagheera'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
slipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) arm around the splendid neck and looked deep into the big
eyes--<div class="bookquote">``art thou sure that all this is Shere Khan's doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the Broken Lock that freed me, I am sure, Little Brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, by the Bull that bought me, I will pay Shere Khan full tale for
this, and it may be a little over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) bounded away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a man. That is all a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera to himself, lying down
again. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Shere Khan, never was a blacker hunting than that frog-hunt
of thine ten years ago!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli was far and far through the forest, running hard, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) heart
was hot in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) came to the cave as the evening mist rose, and drew
breath, and looked down the valley. The cubs were out, but Mother
Wolf, at the back of the cave, knew by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) breathing that something was
troubling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) frog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Son?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some bat's chatter of Shere Khan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) called back. <div class="bookquote">``I hunt among the
plowed fields tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) plunged downward through the bushes, to
the stream at the bottom of the valley. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) checked, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) heard
the yell of the Pack hunting, heard the bellow of a hunted Sambhur,
and the snort as the buck turned at bay. Then there were wicked, bitter
howls from the young wolves: <div class="bookquote">``Akela! Akela! Let the Lone Wolf show his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>)
strength. Room for the leader of the Pack! Spring, Akela!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the wolves</b></font>)</div><p/>The Lone Wolf must have sprung and missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) hold, for Mowgli heard the
snap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) teeth and then a yelp as the Sambhur knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) over with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) forefoot.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) did not wait for anything more, but dashed on; and the yells grew
fainter behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) ran into the croplands where the villagers
lived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bagheera spoke truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) panted, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) nestled down in some cattle
fodder by the window of a hut. <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow is one day both for Akela and
for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) face close to the window and watched the fire on
the hearth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) saw the husbandman's wife get up and feed it in the night
with black lumps. And when the morning came and the mists were all white
and cold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) saw the man's child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside
with earth, fill it with lumps of red-hot charcoal, put it under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
blanket, and go out to tend the cows in the byre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``If a cub can do it, there is nothing to
fear.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) strode round the corner and met the boy, took the pot from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) hand, and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are very like me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, blowing into the pot as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had
seen the woman do. <div class="bookquote">``This thing will die if I do not give it things to
eat'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff. Halfway up
the hill he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) met Bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Akela has missed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Panther. <div class="bookquote">``They would have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) last
night, but they needed thee also. They were looking for thee on the
hill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was among the plowed lands. I am ready. See!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>Mowgli held up the
fire-pot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! Now, I have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff, and
presently the Red Flower blossomed at the end of it. Art thou not
afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Why should I fear? I remember now--if it is not a dream--how,
before I was a Wolf, I lay beside the Red Flower, and it was warm and
pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>All that day Mowgli sat in the cave tending his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) fire pot and dipping
dry branches into it to see how they looked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) found a branch that
satisfied him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>), and in the evening when Tabaqui came to the cave and told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) rudely enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was wanted at the Council Rock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) laughed
till Tabaqui ran away. Then Mowgli went to the Council, still laughing.

<p/>Akela the Lone Wolf lay by the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) rock as a sign that the
leadership of the Pack was open, and Shere Khan with his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) following of
scrap-fed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered. Bagheera lay
close to Mowgli, and the fire pot was between Mowgli's knees. When they
were all gathered together, Shere Khan began to speak--a thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) would
never have dared to do when Akela was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) prime.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) has no right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered Bagheera. <div class="bookquote">``Say so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) is a dog's son. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>)
will be frightened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Free People,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``does Shere Khan
lead the Pack? What has a tiger to do with our leadership?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seeing that the leadership is yet open, and being asked to speak--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div>Shere Khan began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``Are we all jackals, to fawn on this cattle
butcher? The leadership of the Pack is with the Pack alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There were yells of <div class="bookquote">``Silence, thou man's cub!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has
kept our Law'' (<font color='red'><b>the seniors</b></font>)</div>; and at last the seniors of the Pack thundered: <div class="bookquote">``Let the
Dead Wolf speak.''  (<font color='red'><b>the seniors</b></font>)</div>When a leader of the Pack has missed his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) kill, he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) is
called the Dead Wolf as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) lives, which is not long.

<p/>Akela raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) old head wearily:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Free People, and ye too, jackals of Shere Khan, for twelve seasons I
have led ye to and from the kill, and in all that time not one has been
trapped or maimed. Now I have missed my kill. Ye know how that plot
was made. Ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my
weakness known. It was cleverly done. Your right is to kill me here on
the Council Rock, now. Therefore, I ask, who comes to make an end of the
Lone Wolf? For it is my right, by the Law of the Jungle, that ye come
one by one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a long hush, for no single wolf cared to fight Akela to
the death. Then Shere Khan roared: <div class="bookquote">``Bah! What have we to do with this
toothless fool? He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is doomed to die! It is the man-cub who has lived too
long. Free People, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was my meat from the first. Give him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to me. I
am weary of this man-wolf folly. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has troubled the jungle for ten
seasons. Give me the man-cub, or I will hunt here always, and not give
you one bone. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is a man, a man's child, and from the marrow of my
bones I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Then more than half the Pack yelled: <div class="bookquote">``A man! A man! What has a man to do
with us? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And turn all the people of the villages against us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div>clamored Shere

between the eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div><p/>Akela lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) head again and said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has eaten our food. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has
slept with us. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has driven game for us. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has broken no word of the
Law of the Jungle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Also, I paid for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a bull when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was accepted. The worth of a

fight for,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera in his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) gentlest voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A bull paid ten years ago!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the Pack snarled. <div class="bookquote">``What do we care for

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or for a pledge?''  (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) white teeth bared under his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) lip.
<div class="bookquote">``Well are ye called the Free People!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No man's cub can run with the people of the jungle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div>howled Shere Khan.
<div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is our brother in all but blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div>Akela went on, <div class="bookquote">``and ye would kill
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here! In truth, I have lived too long. Some of ye are eaters of
cattle, and of others I have heard that, under Shere Khan's teaching,
ye go by dark night and snatch children from the villager's doorstep.
Therefore I know ye to be cowards, and it is to cowards I speak. It is
certain that I must die, and my life is of no worth, or I would offer
that in the man-cub's place. But for the sake of the Honor of
the Pack,--a little matter that by being without a leader ye have
forgotten,--I promise that if ye let the man-cub go to his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) own place, I
will not, when my time comes to die, bare one tooth against ye. I will
die without fighting. That will at least save the Pack three lives.
More I cannot do; but if ye will, I can save ye the shame that comes of
killing a brother against whom there is no fault--a brother spoken for
and bought into the Pack according to the Law of the Jungle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is a man--a man--a man!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>snarled the Pack. And most of the wolves
began to gather round Shere Khan, whose tail was beginning to switch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now the business is in thy hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera to Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``We can do
no more except fight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli stood upright--the fire pot in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) hands. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) stretched out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) arms, and yawned in the face of the Council; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was furious with
rage and sorrow, for, wolflike, the wolves had never told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) how they
hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Listen you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``There is no need for this dog's
jabber. Ye have told me so often tonight that I am a man -LRB-and indeed I
would have been a wolf with you to my life's end-RRB- that I feel your words
are true. So I do not call ye my brothers any more, but sag -LSB-dogs-RSB-, as
a man should. What ye will do, and what ye will not do, is not yours
to say. That matter is with me; and that we may see the matter more
plainly, I, the man, have brought here a little of the Red Flower which
ye, dogs, fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) flung the fire pot on the ground, and some of the red coals lit
a tuft of dried moss that flared up, as all the Council drew back in
terror before the leaping flames.

<p/>Mowgli thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and
crackled, and whirled it above his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head among the cowering wolves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou art the master,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera in an undertone. <div class="bookquote">``Save Akela from
the death. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was ever thy friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div><p/>Akela, the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) life, gave
one piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood all naked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) long black
hair tossing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that
made the shadows jump and quiver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, staring round slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I see that ye are dogs. I go
from you to my own people--if they be my own people. The jungle is shut
to me, and I must forget your talk and your companionship. But I will be
more merciful than ye are. Because I was all but your brother in blood,
I promise that when I am a man among men I will not betray ye to men as
ye have betrayed me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) kicked the fire with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) foot, and the sparks
flew up. <div class="bookquote">``There shall be no war between any of us in the Pack. But here
is a debt to pay before I go.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) strode forward to where Shere Khan sat
blinking stupidly at the flames, and caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) by the tuft on his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) chin.
Bagheera followed in case of accidents. <div class="bookquote">``Up, dog!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>Mowgli cried. <div class="bookquote">``Up,
when a man speaks, or I will set that coat ablaze!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Shere Khan's ears lay flat back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) eyes, for
the blazing branch was very near.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This cattle-killer said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would kill me in the Council because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
not killed me when I was a cub. Thus and thus, then, do we beat dogs
when we are men. Stir a whisker, Lungri, and I ram the Red Flower down
thy gullet!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) beat Shere Khan over the head with the branch, and the
tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pah! Singed jungle cat--go now! But remember when next I come to the
Council Rock, as a man should come, it will be with Shere Khan's hide
on my head. For the rest, Akela goes free to live as he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) pleases. Ye will
not kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>), because that is not my will. Nor do I think that ye
will sit here any longer, lolling out your tongues as though ye were
somebodies, instead of dogs whom I drive out--thus! Go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>The fire was
burning furiously at the end of the branch, and Mowgli struck right
and left round the circle, and the wolves ran howling with the sparks
burning their fur. At last there were only Akela, Bagheera, and perhaps
ten wolves that had taken Mowgli's part. Then something began to hurt
Mowgli inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had never been hurt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) life before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) breath and sobbed, and the tears ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it? What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I do not wish to leave the jungle,
and I do not know what this is. Am I dying, Bagheera?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Little Brother. That is only tears such as men use,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera.
<div class="bookquote">``Now I know thou art a man, and a man's cub no longer. The jungle is
shut indeed to thee henceforward. Let them fall, Mowgli. They are only
tears.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>So Mowgli sat and cried as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) heart would break; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
had never cried in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) life before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I will go to men. But first I must say farewell to my
mother.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) went to the cave where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) lived with Father Wolf, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) cried on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) coat, while the four cubs howled miserably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye will not forget me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never while we can follow a trail,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the cubs. <div class="bookquote">``Come to the foot of
the hill when thou art a man, and we will talk to thee; and we will come
into the croplands to play with thee by night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come soon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>said Father Wolf. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, wise little frog, come again soon;
for we be old, thy mother and I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mother Wolf/Mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mother Wolf/Mother</b></font>)</div>said Mother Wolf, <div class="bookquote">``little naked son of mine. For, listen,
child of man, I loved thee more than ever I loved my cubs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mother Wolf/Mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will surely come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``And when I come it will be to lay
out Shere Khan's hide upon the Council Rock. Do not forget me! Tell them
in the jungle never to forget me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>The dawn was beginning to break when Mowgli went down the hillside
alone, to meet those mysterious things that are called men.




<p/>Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack

<p/>As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled
Once, twice and again!
And a doe leaped up, and a doe leaped up
From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup.
This I, scouting alone, beheld,
Once, twice and again!

<p/>As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled
Once, twice and again!
And a wolf stole back, and a wolf stole back
To carry the word to the waiting pack,
And we sought and we found and we bayed on his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) track
Once, twice and again!

<p/>As the dawn was breaking the Wolf Pack yelled
Once, twice and again!
Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!

<p/>Eyes that can see in the dark--the dark!
Tongue--give tongue to it! Hark! O hark!
Once, twice and again!




<p/>Kaa's Hunting

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) spots are the joy of the Leopard: his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) horns are the
Buffalo's pride.
Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the
gloss of his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) hide.
If ye find that the Bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed
Sambhur can gore;
Ye need not stop work to inform us: we knew it ten seasons
before.
Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister
and Brother,
For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is
their mother.
<div class="bookquote">``There is none like to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Cub</b></font>)</div>says the Cub in the pride of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>)
earliest kill;
But the jungle is large and the Cub he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) is small. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>)
think and be still.
Maxims of Baloo


<p/>All that is told here happened some time before Mowgli was turned out of
the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It
was in the days when Baloo was teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) the Law of the Jungle. The
big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil,
for the young wolves will only learn as much of the Law of the Jungle
as applies to their own pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can
repeat the Hunting Verse--<div class="bookquote">``Feet that make no noise; eyes that can see in
the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their lairs, and sharp white
teeth, all these things are the marks of our brothers except Tabaqui the
Jackal and the Hyaena whom we hate.''  (<font color='red'><b>the wolves</b></font>)</div>But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to
learn a great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black Panther
would come lounging through the jungle to see how his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) pet was getting
on, and would purr with his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) head against a tree while Mowgli recited the
day's lesson to Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could
swim, and swim almost as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could run. So Baloo, the Teacher of
the Law, taught him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the Wood and Water Laws: how to tell a rotten branch
from a sound one; how to speak politely to the wild bees when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) came
upon a hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang the
Bat when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mang</b></font>) disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mang</b></font>) in the branches at midday; and how to warn the
water-snakes in the pools before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mang</b></font>) splashed down among them. None of
the Jungle People like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at
an intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers' Hunting Call,
which must be repeated aloud till it is answered, whenever one of the
Jungle-People hunts outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) own grounds. It means, translated, <div class="bookquote">``Give
me leave to hunt here because I am hungry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the answer is, <div class="bookquote">``Hunt
then for food, but not for pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn by heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
grew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times. But, as
Baloo said to Bagheera, one day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off
in a temper, <div class="bookquote">``A man's cub is a man's cub, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must learn all the Law
of the Jungle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But think how small he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said the Black Panther, who would have
spoiled Mowgli if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) own way. <div class="bookquote">``How can his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little head carry
all thy long talk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed? No. That is
why I teach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) these things, and that is why I hit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), very softly,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forgets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Iron-feet?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bagheera
grunted. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face is all bruised today by thy--softness. Ugh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be bruised from head to foot by me who love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) than
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should come to harm through ignorance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>Baloo answered very
earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``I am now teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the Master Words of the Jungle that
shall protect him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the birds and the Snake People, and all that hunt
on four feet, except his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own pack. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can now claim protection, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
will only remember the words, from all in the jungle. Is not that worth
a little beating?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, look to it then that thou dost not kill the man-cub. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is no
tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon. But what are those Master
Words? I am more likely to give help than to ask it'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Bagheera stretched
out one paw and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end
of it--<div class="bookquote">``still I should like to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will call Mowgli and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) shall say them--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) will. Come, Little
Brother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My head is ringing like a bee tree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said a sullen little voice over
their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk very angry and indignant,
adding as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) reached the ground: <div class="bookquote">``I come for Bagheera and not for thee,
fat old Baloo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is all one to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was hurt and grieved.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of the Jungle that I have taught
thee this day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Master Words for which people?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, delighted to show off.
<div class="bookquote">``The jungle has many tongues. I know them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little thou knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera, they never thank
their teacher. Not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank
old Baloo for his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) teachings. Say the word for the Hunting-People,
then--great scholar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We be of one blood, ye and I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, giving the words the Bear
accent which all the Hunting People use.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. Now for the birds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli repeated, with the Kite's whistle at the end of the sentence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now for the Snake-People,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera.

<p/>The answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and Mowgli kicked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
feet behind, clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) hands together to applaud himself, and jumped
on to Bagheera's back, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) sat sideways, drumming with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) heels on
the glossy skin and making the worst faces he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could think of at Baloo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There--there! That was worth a little bruise,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the brown bear
tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``Some day thou wilt remember me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) turned aside to
tell Bagheera how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had begged the Master Words from Hathi the Wild
Elephant, who knows all about these things, and how Hathi had taken
Mowgli down to a pool to get the Snake Word from a water-snake, because
Baloo could not pronounce it, and how Mowgli was now reasonably safe
against all accidents in the jungle, because neither snake, bird, nor
beast would hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one then is to be feared,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>Baloo wound up, patting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) big furry
stomach with pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Except his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) own tribe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) breath; and then aloud
to Mowgli, <div class="bookquote">``Have a care for my ribs, Little Brother! What is all this
dancing up and down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at Bagheera's
shoulder fur and kicking hard. When the two listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was
shouting at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``And so I shall have a tribe of my
own, and lead them through the branches all day long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>Mowgli went on. <div class="bookquote">``They
have promised me this. Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whoof!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>Baloo's big paw scooped Mowgli off Bagheera's back, and as the
boy lay between the big fore-paws he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could see the Bear was angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mowgli,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo, <div class="bookquote">``thou hast been talking with the Bandar-log--the
Monkey People.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was angry too, and
Bagheera's eyes were as hard as jade stones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou hast been with the Monkey People--the gray apes--the people
without a law--the eaters of everything. That is great shame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When Baloo hurt my head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was still on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) back-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I
went away, and the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on
me. No one else cared.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) snuffled a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The pity of the Monkey People!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>Baloo snorted. <div class="bookquote">``The stillness of the
mountain stream! The cool of the summer sun! And then, man-cub?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant things to eat, and
they--they carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said
I was their blood brother except that I had no tail, and should be their
leader some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have no leader,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera. <div class="bookquote">``They lie. They have always lied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were very kind and bade me come again. Why have I never been taken
among the Monkey People? They stand on their feet as I do. They do
not hit me with their hard paws. They play all day. Let me get up! Bad
Baloo, let me up! I will play with them again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, man-cub,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Bear voice</b></font>)</div>said the Bear, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) voice rumbled like thunder on
a hot night. <div class="bookquote">``I have taught thee all the Law of the Jungle for all the
peoples of the jungle--except the Monkey-Folk who live in the trees.
They have no law. They are outcasts. They have no speech of their own,
but use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep,
and wait up above in the branches. Their way is not our way. They are
without leaders. They have no remembrance. They boast and chatter and
pretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the
jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all
is forgotten. We of the jungle have no dealings with them. We do not
drink where the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys go; we do
not hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die. Hast thou ever
heard me speak of the Bandar-log till today?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli in a whisper, for the forest was very still now Baloo
had finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Jungle-People put them out of their mouths and out of their minds.
They are very many, evil, dirty, shameless, and they desire, if they
have any fixed desire, to be noticed by the Jungle People. But we do not
notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down
through the branches; and they could hear coughings and howlings and
angry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Monkey-People are forbidden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo, <div class="bookquote">``forbidden to the
Jungle-People. Remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forbidden,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, <div class="bookquote">``but I still think Baloo should have warned
thee against them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I? How was I to guess he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would play with such dirt. The Monkey
People! Faugh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>A fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away, taking
Mowgli with them. What Baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly
true. They belonged to the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look
up, there was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to cross
each other's path. But whenever they found a sick wolf, or a wounded
tiger, or bear, the monkeys would torment him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>), and would throw sticks
and nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed. Then
they would howl and shriek senseless songs, and invite the Jungle-People
to climb up their trees and fight them, or would start furious battles
over nothing among themselves, and leave the dead monkeys where the
Jungle-People could see them. They were always just going to have a
leader, and laws and customs of their own, but they never did, because
their memories would not hold over from day to day, and so they
compromised things by making up a saying, <div class="bookquote">``What the Bandar-log think now
the jungle will think later,''  (<font color='red'><b>a leader</b></font>)</div>and that comforted them a great deal. None
of the beasts could reach them, but on the other hand none of the beasts
would notice them, and that was why they were so pleased when Mowgli
came to play with them, and they heard how angry Baloo was.

<p/>They never meant to do any more--the Bandar-log never mean anything at
all; but one of them invented what seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) a brilliant idea, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) told all the others that Mowgli would be a useful person to keep in
the tribe, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could weave sticks together for protection from
the wind; so, if they caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>), they could make him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) teach them.
Of course Mowgli, as a woodcutter's child, inherited all sorts of
instincts, and used to make little huts of fallen branches without
thinking how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) came to do it. The Monkey-People, watching in the trees,
considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) play most wonderful. This time, they said, they were
really going to have a leader and become the wisest people in the
jungle--so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them. Therefore
they followed Baloo and Bagheera and Mowgli through the jungle very
quietly till it was time for the midday nap, and Mowgli, who was
very much ashamed of himself, slept between the Panther and the Bear,
resolving to have no more to do with the Monkey People.

<p/>The next thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) remembered was feeling hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) legs and
arms--hard, strong, little hands--and then a swash of branches in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
face, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was staring down through the swaying boughs as Baloo
woke the jungle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) deep cries and Bagheera bounded up the trunk
with every tooth bared. The Bandar-log howled with triumph and scuffled
away to the upper branches where Bagheera dared not follow, shouting:
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) has noticed us! Bagheera has noticed us. All the Jungle-People
admire us for our skill and our cunning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then they began their flight;
and the flight of the Monkey-People through tree-land is one of
the things nobody can describe. They have their regular roads and
crossroads, up hills and down hills, all laid out from fifty to seventy
or a hundred feet above ground, and by these they can travel even at
night if necessary. Two of the strongest monkeys caught Mowgli under
the arms and swung off with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) through the treetops, twenty feet at a
bound. Had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast, but the
boy's weight held them back. Sick and giddy as Mowgli was he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could not
help enjoying the wild rush, though the glimpses of earth far down below
frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>), and the terrible check and jerk at the end of the swing
over nothing but empty air brought his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) heart between his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) teeth. His (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>)
escort would rush him (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) up a tree till he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) felt the thinnest topmost
branches crackle and bend under them, and then with a cough and a whoop
would fling themselves into the air outward and downward, and bring
up, hanging by their hands or their feet to the lower limbs of the next
tree. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) could see for miles and miles across the still green
jungle, as a man on the top of a mast can see for miles across the sea,
and then the branches and leaves would lash him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) across the face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two guards would be almost down to earth again. So, bounding and
crashing and whooping and yelling, the whole tribe of Bandar-log swept
along the tree-roads with Mowgli their prisoner.

<p/>For a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was afraid of being dropped. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) grew angry but knew
better than to struggle, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) began to think. The first thing was
to send back word to Baloo and Bagheera, for, at the pace the monkeys
were going, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) friends would be left far behind. It was useless
to look down, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could only see the topsides of the branches, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
stared upward and saw, far away in the blue, Rann the Kite balancing
and wheeling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kite</b></font>) kept watch over the jungle waiting for things to die.
Rann saw that the monkeys were carrying something, and dropped a
few hundred yards to find out whether their load was good to eat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>)
whistled with surprise when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) saw Mowgli being dragged up to a treetop
and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) give the Kite call for--<div class="bookquote">``We be of one blood, thou and I.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kite</b></font>)</div>The waves of the branches closed over the boy, but Rann balanced away to
the next tree in time to see the little brown face come up again. <div class="bookquote">``Mark
my trail!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>Mowgli shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Tell Baloo of the Seeonee Pack and Bagheera
of the Council Rock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In whose name, Brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rann</b></font>)</div>Rann had never seen Mowgli before, though of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) had heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mowgli, the Frog. Man-cub they call me! Mark my trail!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The last words were shrieked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) was being swung through the air, but
Rann nodded and rose up till he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) looked no bigger than a speck of dust,
and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) hung, watching with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) telescope eyes the swaying of the
treetops as Mowgli's escort whirled along.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They never go far,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said with a chuckle. <div class="bookquote">``They never do what they
set out to do. Always pecking at new things are the Bandar-log. This
time, if I have any eye-sight, they have pecked down trouble for
themselves, for Baloo is no fledgling and Bagheera can, as I know, kill
more than goats.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) rocked on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) wings, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) feet gathered up under him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>), and waited.

<p/>Meantime, Baloo and Bagheera were furious with rage and grief. Bagheera
climbed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had never climbed before, but the thin branches broke
beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) weight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) slipped down, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) claws full of bark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didst thou not warn the man-cub?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) roared to poor Baloo, who had
set off at a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking the monkeys. <div class="bookquote">``What
was the use of half slaying him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) with blows if thou didst not warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haste! O haste! We--we may catch them yet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>Baloo panted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At that speed! It would not tire a wounded cow. Teacher of the
Law--cub-beater--a mile of that rolling to and fro would burst thee
open. Sit still and think! Make a plan. This is no time for chasing.
They may drop him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) if we follow too close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Arrula! Whoo! They may have dropped him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) already, being tired of
carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>). Who can trust the Bandar-log? Put dead bats on my head!
Give me black bones to eat! Roll me into the hives of the wild bees
that I may be stung to death, and bury me with the Hyaena, for I am most
miserable of bears! Arulala! Wahooa! O Mowgli, Mowgli! Why did I not
warn thee against the Monkey-Folk instead of breaking thy head? Now
perhaps I may have knocked the day's lesson out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) will
be alone in the jungle without the Master Words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div><p/>Baloo clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) paws over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) ears and rolled to and fro moaning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At least he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) gave me all the Words correctly a little time ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Bagheera impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Baloo, thou hast neither memory nor respect. What
would the jungle think if I, the Black Panther, curled myself up like
Ikki the Porcupine, and howled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I care what the jungle thinks? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ikki</b></font>) may be dead by now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless and until they drop him (<font color='blue'><b>Ikki</b></font>) from the branches in sport, or kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Ikki</b></font>)
out of idleness, I have no fear for the man-cub. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ikki</b></font>) is wise and well
taught, and above all he (<font color='blue'><b>Ikki</b></font>) has the eyes that make the Jungle-People
afraid. But -LRB-and it is a great evil-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Ikki</b></font>) is in the power of the
Bandar-log, and they, because they live in trees, have no fear of any of
our people.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bagheera licked one forepaw thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fool that I am! Oh, fat, brown, root-digging fool that I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said
Baloo, uncoiling himself with a jerk, <div class="bookquote">``it is true what Hathi the Wild
Elephant says: `To each his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own fear'; and they, the Bandar-log, fear
Kaa the Rock Snake. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) can climb as well as they can. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) steals the
young monkeys in the night. The whisper of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) name makes their wicked
tails cold. Let us go to Kaa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a jerk</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) do for us? He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is not of our tribe, being footless--and
with most evil eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is very old and very cunning. Above all, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is always hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said
Baloo hopefully. <div class="bookquote">``Promise him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) many goats.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) sleeps for a full month after he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has once eaten. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) may be asleep
now, and even were he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) awake what if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) would rather kill his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own goats?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>Bagheera, who did not know much about Kaa, was naturally suspicious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then in that case, thou and I together, old hunter, might make him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) see
reason.''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>Here Baloo rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) faded brown shoulder against the Panther,
and they went off to look for Kaa the Rock Python.

<p/>They found him (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) stretched out on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun,
admiring his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) beautiful new coat, for he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) had been in retirement for the
last ten days changing his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) skin, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) was very splendid--darting
his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) big blunt-nosed head along the ground, and twisting the thirty feet
of his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) body into fantastic knots and curves, and licking his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>)
thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) dinner to come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) has not eaten,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo, with a grunt of relief, as soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) saw the beautifully mottled brown and yellow jacket. <div class="bookquote">``Be careful,
Bagheera! He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) is always a little blind after he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) has changed his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) skin, and
very quick to strike.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div><p/>Kaa was not a poison snake--in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) rather despised the poison snakes
as cowards--but his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) strength lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) hug, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) had once
lapped his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) huge coils round anybody there was no more to be said. <div class="bookquote">``Good
hunting!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>cried Baloo, sitting up on his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) haunches. Like all snakes of
his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) breed Kaa was rather deaf, and did not hear the call at first. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) curled up ready for any accident, his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) head lowered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good hunting for us all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Oho, Baloo, what dost thou do
here? Good hunting, Bagheera. One of us at least needs food. Is there
any news of game afoot? A doe now, or even a young buck? I am as empty
as a dried well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are hunting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo carelessly. He (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) knew that you must not hurry
Kaa. He (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) is too big.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me permission to come with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>said Kaa. <div class="bookquote">``A blow more or less is
nothing to thee, Bagheera or Baloo, but I--I have to wait and wait for
days in a wood-path and climb half a night on the mere chance of a
young ape. Psshaw! The branches are not what they were when I was young.
Rotten twigs and dry boughs are they all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said
Baloo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a fair length--a fair length,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>said Kaa with a little pride. <div class="bookquote">``But
for all that, it is the fault of this new-grown timber. I came very
near to falling on my last hunt--very near indeed--and the noise of my
slipping, for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tree, waked the
Bandar-log, and they called me most evil names.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Footless, yellow earth-worm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera under his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) whiskers, as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) were trying to remember something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sssss! Have they ever called me that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>said Kaa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something of that kind it was that they shouted to us last moon, but we
never noticed them. They will say anything--even that thou hast lost all
thy teeth, and wilt not face anything bigger than a kid, because -LRB-they
are indeed shameless, these Bandar-log-RRB---because thou art afraid of the
he-goat's horns,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bagheera went on sweetly.

<p/>Now a snake, especially a wary old python like Kaa, very seldom shows
that he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) is angry, but Baloo and Bagheera could see the big swallowing
muscles on either side of Kaa's throat ripple and bulge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Bandar-log have shifted their grounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``When I
came up into the sun today I heard them whooping among the tree-tops.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It--it is the Bandar-log that we follow now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo, but the words
stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) throat, for that was the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) memory that one
of the Jungle-People had owned to being interested in the doings of the
monkeys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such
hunters--leaders in their own jungle I am certain--on the trail of the
Bandar-log,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>Kaa replied courteously, as he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) swelled with curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>Baloo began, <div class="bookquote">``I am no more than the old and sometimes very
foolish Teacher of the Law to the Seeonee wolf-cubs, and Bagheera
here--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Bagheera,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said the Black Panther, and his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) jaws shut with a snap,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) did not believe in being humble. <div class="bookquote">``The trouble is this, Kaa. Those
nut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of
whom thou hast perhaps heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard some news from Ikki -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) quills make him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) presumptuous-RRB- of a
man-thing that was entered into a wolf pack, but I did not believe. Ikki
is full of stories half heard and very badly told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ikki</b></font>) is such a man-cub as never was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo. <div class="bookquote">``The

make the name of Baloo famous through all the jungles; and besides,
I--we--love him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>), Kaa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ts! Ts!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>said Kaa, weaving his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) head to and fro. <div class="bookquote">``I also have known what
love is. There are tales I could tell that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Our man-cub is in the hands of the Bandar-log
now, and we know that of all the Jungle-People they fear Kaa alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They fear me alone. They have good reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>said Kaa. <div class="bookquote">``Chattering,
foolish, vain--vain, foolish, and chattering, are the monkeys. But a
man-thing in their hands is in no good luck. They grow tired of the nuts
they pick, and throw them down. They carry a branch half a day, meaning
to do great things with it, and then they snap it in two. That man-thing
is not to be envied. They called me also--`yellow fish' was it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worm--worm--earth-worm,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, <div class="bookquote">``as well as other things which
I cannot now say for shame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must remind them to speak well of their master. Aaa-ssp! We must
help their wandering memories. Now, whither went they with the cub?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The jungle alone knows. Toward the sunset, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo. <div class="bookquote">``We
had thought that thou wouldst know, Kaa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? How? I take them when they come in my way, but I do not hunt the
Bandar-log, or frogs--or green scum on a water-hole, for that matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Up, Up! Up, Up! Hillo! Illo! Illo, look up, Baloo of the Seeonee Wolf
Pack!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div><p/>Baloo looked up to see where the voice came from, and there was Rann the
Kite, sweeping down with the sun shining on the upturned flanges of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kite</b></font>)
wings. It was near Rann's bedtime, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) had ranged all over the jungle
looking for the Bear and had missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) in the thick foliage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen Mowgli among the Bandar-log. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) bade me tell you. I
watched. The Bandar-log have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) beyond the river to the monkey
city--to the Cold Lairs. They may stay there for a night, or ten nights,
or an hour. I have told the bats to watch through the dark time. That is
my message. Good hunting, all you below!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Full gorge and a deep sleep to you, Rann,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Bagheera. <div class="bookquote">``I will
remember thee in my next kill, and put aside the head for thee alone, O
best of kites!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing. It is nothing. The boy held the Master Word. I could
have done no less,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rann</b></font>)</div>and Rann circled up again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rann</b></font>) roost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) has not forgotten to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo with a chuckle of
pride. <div class="bookquote">``To think of one so young remembering the Master Word for the
birds too while he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was being pulled across trees!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was most firmly driven into him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera. <div class="bookquote">``But I am proud of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>), and now we must go to the Cold Lairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jungle People</b></font>)</div><p/>They all knew where that place was, but few of the Jungle People ever
went there, because what they called the Cold Lairs was an old deserted
city, lost and buried in the jungle, and beasts seldom use a place that
men have once used. The wild boar will, but the hunting tribes do not.
Besides, the monkeys lived there as much as they could be said to live
anywhere, and no self-respecting animal would come within eyeshot of it
except in times of drought, when the half-ruined tanks and reservoirs
held a little water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is half a night's journey--at full speed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, and Baloo
looked very serious. <div class="bookquote">``I will go as fast as I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>monkeys</b></font>) said anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We dare not wait for thee. Follow, Baloo. We must go on the
quick-foot--Kaa and I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Feet or no feet, I can keep abreast of all thy four,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>said Kaa shortly.
Baloo made one effort to hurry, but had to sit down panting, and so they
left him (<font color='blue'><b>monkeys</b></font>) to come on later, while Bagheera hurried forward, at the quick
panther-canter. Kaa said nothing, but, strive as Bagheera might, the
huge Rock-python held level with him (<font color='blue'><b>monkeys</b></font>). When they came to a hill stream,
Bagheera gained, because he (<font color='blue'><b>monkeys</b></font>) bounded across while Kaa swam, his (<font color='blue'><b>monkeys</b></font>) head and
two feet of his (<font color='blue'><b>monkeys</b></font>) neck clearing the water, but on level ground Kaa made up
the distance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the Broken Lock that freed me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, when twilight had
fallen, <div class="bookquote">``thou art no slow goer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>said Kaa. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, they called me speckled frog.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worm--earth-worm, and yellow to boot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All one. Let us go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>and Kaa seemed to pour himself along the
ground, finding the shortest road with his (<font color='blue'><b>monkeys</b></font>) steady eyes, and keeping to
it.

<p/>In the Cold Lairs the Monkey-People were not thinking of Mowgli's
friends at all. They had brought the boy to the Lost City, and were
very much pleased with themselves for the time. Mowgli had never seen an
Indian city before, and though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed
very wonderful and splendid. Some king had built it long ago on a little
hill. You could still trace the stone causeways that led up to the
ruined gates where the last splinters of wood hung to the worn, rusted
hinges. Trees had grown into and out of the walls; the battlements were
tumbled down and decayed, and wild creepers hung out of the windows of
the towers on the walls in bushy hanging clumps.

<p/>A great roofless palace crowned the hill, and the marble of the
courtyards and the fountains was split, and stained with red and green,
and the very cobblestones in the courtyard where the king's elephants
used to live had been thrust up and apart by grasses and young trees.
From the palace you could see the rows and rows of roofless houses that
made up the city looking like empty honeycombs filled with blackness;
the shapeless block of stone that had been an idol in the square where
four roads met; the pits and dimples at street corners where the public
wells once stood, and the shattered domes of temples with wild figs
sprouting on their sides. The monkeys called the place their city, and
pretended to despise the Jungle-People because they lived in the forest.
And yet they never knew what the buildings were made for nor how to
use them. They would sit in circles on the hall of the king's council
chamber, and scratch for fleas and pretend to be men; or they would run
in and out of the roofless houses and collect pieces of plaster and old
bricks in a corner, and forget where they had hidden them, and fight
and cry in scuffling crowds, and then break off to play up and down the
terraces of the king's garden, where they would shake the rose trees and
the oranges in sport to see the fruit and flowers fall. They explored
all the passages and dark tunnels in the palace and the hundreds of
little dark rooms, but they never remembered what they had seen and what
they had not; and so drifted about in ones and twos or crowds telling
each other that they were doing as men did. They drank at the tanks and
made the water all muddy, and then they fought over it, and then they
would all rush together in mobs and shout: <div class="bookquote">``There is no one in the
jungle so wise and good and clever and strong and gentle as the
Bandar-log.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then all would begin again till they grew tired of the city
and went back to the tree-tops, hoping the Jungle-People would notice
them.

<p/>Mowgli, who had been trained under the Law of the Jungle, did not like
or understand this kind of life. The monkeys dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) into the Cold
Lairs late in the afternoon, and instead of going to sleep, as Mowgli
would have done after a long journey, they joined hands and danced about
and sang their foolish songs. One of the monkeys made a speech and told
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) companions that Mowgli's capture marked a new thing in the history
of the Bandar-log, for Mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks
and canes together as a protection against rain and cold. Mowgli picked
up some creepers and began to work them in and out, and the monkeys
tried to imitate; but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began
to pull their friends' tails or jump up and down on all fours, coughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``I am a stranger in this part of the
jungle. Bring me food, or give me leave to hunt here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>monkeys</b></font>)</div><p/>Twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) nuts and wild
pawpaws. But they fell to fighting on the road, and it was too much
trouble to go back with what was left of the fruit. Mowgli was sore and
angry as well as hungry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) roamed through the empty city giving the
Strangers' Hunting Call from time to time, but no one answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>), and
Mowgli felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had reached a very bad place indeed. <div class="bookquote">``All that Baloo
has said about the Bandar-log is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) thought to himself. <div class="bookquote">``They
have no Law, no Hunting Call, and no leaders--nothing but foolish words
and little picking thievish hands. So if I am starved or killed here,
it will be all my own fault. But I must try to return to my own jungle.
Baloo will surely beat me, but that is better than chasing silly rose
leaves with the Bandar-log.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>No sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
back, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) did not know how happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was, and pinching
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) grateful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) teeth and said nothing, but
went with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone
reservoirs that were half-full of rain water. There was a ruined
summer-house of white marble in the center of the terrace, built for
queens dead a hundred years ago. The domed roof had half fallen in and
blocked up the underground passage from the palace by which the
queens used to enter. But the walls were made of screens of marble
tracery--beautiful milk-white fretwork, set with agates and cornelians
and jasper and lapis lazuli, and as the moon came up behind the hill it
shone through the open work, casting shadows on the ground like black
velvet embroidery. Sore, sleepy, and hungry as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was, Mowgli could not
help laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a time, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
how great and wise and strong and gentle they were, and how foolish he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
was to wish to leave them. <div class="bookquote">``We are great. We are free. We are wonderful.
We are the most wonderful people in all the jungle! We all say so, and
so it must be true,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Now as you are a new listener and
can carry our words back to the Jungle-People so that they may notice us
in future, we will tell you all about our most excellent selves.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>Mowgli
made no objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on
the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the
Bandar-log, and whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would
all shout together: <div class="bookquote">``This is true; we all say so.''  (<font color='red'><b>a speaker</b></font>)</div>Mowgli nodded and
blinked, and said <div class="bookquote">``Yes''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>when they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) a question, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head
spun with the noise. <div class="bookquote">``Tabaqui the Jackal must have bitten all these
people,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``and now they have madness. Certainly this
is dewanee, the madness. Do they never go to sleep? Now there is a cloud
coming to cover that moon. If it were only a big enough cloud I might
try to run away in the darkness. But I am tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>That same cloud was being watched by two good friends in the ruined
ditch below the city wall, for Bagheera and Kaa, knowing well how
dangerous the Monkey-People were in large numbers, did not wish to run
any risks. The monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one, and
few in the jungle care for those odds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go to the west wall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>Kaa whispered, <div class="bookquote">``and come down swiftly with
the slope of the ground in my favor. They will not throw themselves upon
my back in their hundreds, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera. <div class="bookquote">``Would that Baloo were here, but we must do
what we can. When that cloud covers the moon I shall go to the terrace.
They hold some sort of council there over the boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good hunting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>said Kaa grimly, and glided away to the west wall. That
happened to be the least ruined of any, and the big snake was delayed
awhile before he (<font color='blue'><b>Kaa</b></font>) could find a way up the stones. The cloud hid the moon,
and as Mowgli wondered what would come next he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) heard Bagheera's light
feet on the terrace. The Black Panther had raced up the slope almost
without a sound and was striking--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) knew better than to waste time in
biting--right and left among the monkeys, who were seated round Mowgli
in circles fifty and sixty deep. There was a howl of fright and rage,
and then as Bagheera tripped on the rolling kicking bodies beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>),
a monkey shouted: <div class="bookquote">``There is only one here! Kill him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)! Kill.''  (<font color='red'><b>a monkey</b></font>)</div>A scuffling
mass of monkeys, biting, scratching, tearing, and pulling, closed over
Bagheera, while five or six laid hold of Mowgli, dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) up the wall
of the summerhouse and pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) through the hole of the broken dome.
A man-trained boy would have been badly bruised, for the fall was a
good fifteen feet, but Mowgli fell as Baloo had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) to fall, and
landed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the monkeys</b></font>)</div>shouted the monkeys, <div class="bookquote">``till we have killed thy friends, and
later we will play with thee--if the Poison-People leave thee alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the monkeys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We be of one blood, ye and I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, quickly giving the Snake's
Call. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could hear rustling and hissing in the rubbish all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
and gave the Call a second time, to make sure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even ssso! Down hoods all!''  (<font color='red'><b>a dozen</b></font>)</div>said half a dozen low voices -LRB-every ruin
in India becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of snakes, and the old
summerhouse was alive with cobras-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Stand still, Little Brother, for
thy feet may do us harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli stood as quietly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could, peering through the open work and
listening to the furious din of the fight round the Black Panther--the
yells and chatterings and scufflings, and Bagheera's deep, hoarse cough
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) backed and bucked and twisted and plunged under the heaps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
enemies. For the first time since he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was born, Bagheera was fighting for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Baloo must be at hand; Bagheera would not have come alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>Mowgli
thought. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) called aloud: <div class="bookquote">``To the tank, Bagheera. Roll to the
water tanks. Roll and plunge! Get to the water!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Bagheera heard, and the cry that told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) Mowgli was safe gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) new
courage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) worked his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) way desperately, inch by inch, straight for the
reservoirs, halting in silence. Then from the ruined wall nearest the
jungle rose up the rumbling war-shout of Baloo. The old Bear had done
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) best, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could not come before. <div class="bookquote">``Bagheera,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) shouted, <div class="bookquote">``I am
here. I climb! I haste! Ahuwora! The stones slip under my feet! Wait my
coming, O most infamous Bandar-log!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) panted up the terrace only
to disappear to the head in a wave of monkeys, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) threw himself
squarely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) haunches, and, spreading out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) forepaws, hugged as
many as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could hold, and then began to hit with a regular bat-bat-bat,
like the flipping strokes of a paddle wheel. A crash and a splash told
Mowgli that Bagheera had fought his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) way to the tank where the monkeys
could not follow. The Panther lay gasping for breath, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head just
out of the water, while the monkeys stood three deep on the red steps,
dancing up and down with rage, ready to spring upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) from all sides
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) came out to help Baloo. It was then that Bagheera lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
dripping chin, and in despair gave the Snake's Call for protection--<div class="bookquote">``We
be of one blood, ye and I'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) believed that Kaa had turned tail
at the last minute. Even Baloo, half smothered under the monkeys on
the edge of the terrace, could not help chuckling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) heard the Black
Panther asking for help.

<p/>Kaa had only just worked his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) way over the west wall, landing with a
wrench that dislodged a coping stone into the ditch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had no intention
of losing any advantage of the ground, and coiled and uncoiled himself
once or twice, to be sure that every foot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) long body was in
working order. All that while the fight with Baloo went on, and the
monkeys yelled in the tank round Bagheera, and Mang the Bat, flying to
and fro, carried the news of the great battle over the jungle, till even
Hathi the Wild Elephant trumpeted, and, far away, scattered bands of
the Monkey-Folk woke and came leaping along the tree-roads to help their
comrades in the Cold Lairs, and the noise of the fight roused all the
day birds for miles round. Then Kaa came straight, quickly, and anxious
to kill. The fighting strength of a python is in the driving blow of
his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) head backed by all the strength and weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) body. If you can
imagine a lance, or a battering ram, or a hammer weighing nearly half
a ton driven by a cool, quiet mind living in the handle of it, you can
roughly imagine what Kaa was like when he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) fought. A python four or five
feet long can knock a man down if he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hits him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) fairly in the chest, and
Kaa was thirty feet long, as you know. His (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) first stroke was delivered
into the heart of the crowd round Baloo. It was sent home with shut
mouth in silence, and there was no need of a second. The monkeys
scattered with cries of--<div class="bookquote">``Kaa! It is Kaa! Run! Run!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The monkeys</b></font>)</div><p/>Generations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by the stories
their elders told them of Kaa, the night thief, who could slip along the
branches as quietly as moss grows, and steal away the strongest monkey
that ever lived; of old Kaa, who could make himself look so like a dead
branch or a rotten stump that the wisest were deceived, till the branch
caught them. Kaa was everything that the monkeys feared in the jungle,
for none of them knew the limits of his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) power, none of them could look
him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) in the face, and none had ever come alive out of his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) hug. And so
they ran, stammering with terror, to the walls and the roofs of the
houses, and Baloo drew a deep breath of relief. His (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) fur was much thicker
than Bagheera's, but he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) had suffered sorely in the fight. Then Kaa
opened his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) mouth for the first time and spoke one long hissing word, and
the far-away monkeys, hurrying to the defense of the Cold Lairs, stayed
where they were, cowering, till the loaded branches bent and crackled
under them. The monkeys on the walls and the empty houses stopped
their cries, and in the stillness that fell upon the city Mowgli heard
Bagheera shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) wet sides as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) came up from the tank. Then the
clamor broke out again. The monkeys leaped higher up the walls. They
clung around the necks of the big stone idols and shrieked as they
skipped along the battlements, while Mowgli, dancing in the summerhouse,
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) eye to the screenwork and hooted owl-fashion between his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) front
teeth, to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) derision and contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get the man-cub out of that trap; I can do no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bagheera gasped.
<div class="bookquote">``Let us take the man-cub and go. They may attack again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will not move till I order them. Stay you sssso!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>Kaa hissed, and
the city was silent once more. <div class="bookquote">``I could not come before, Brother, but I
think I heard thee call'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--this was to Bagheera.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I may have cried out in the battle,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bagheera answered. ``Baloo, art
thou hurt?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little
bearlings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo, gravely shaking one leg after the other. <div class="bookquote">``Wow! I
am sore. Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives--Bagheera and I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter. Where is the manling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, in a trap. I cannot climb out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>cried Mowgli. The curve of the
broken dome was above his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) dances like Mao the Peacock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) will crush our
young,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the cobras inside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>said Kaa with a chuckle, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) has friends everywhere, this
manling. Stand back, manling. And hide you, O Poison People. I break
down the wall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div><p/>Kaa looked carefully till he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) found a discolored crack in the marble
tracery showing a weak spot, made two or three light taps with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head
to get the distance, and then lifting up six feet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) body clear
of the ground, sent home half a dozen full-power smashing blows,
nose-first. The screen-work broke and fell away in a cloud of dust and
rubbish, and Mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between
Baloo and Bagheera--an arm around each big neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Art thou hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo, hugging him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised. But, oh, they have handled
ye grievously, my Brothers! Ye bleed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Others also,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, licking his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) lips and looking at the
monkey-dead on the terrace and round the tank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing, it is nothing, if thou art safe, oh, my pride of all
little frogs!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whimpered Baloo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of that we shall judge later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, in a dry voice that
Mowgli did not at all like. <div class="bookquote">``But here is Kaa to whom we owe the battle
and thou owest thy life. Thank him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) according to our customs, Mowgli.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli turned and saw the great Python's head swaying a foot above his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So this is the manling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>said Kaa. <div class="bookquote">``Very soft is his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) skin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) is
not unlike the Bandar-log. Have a care, manling, that I do not mistake
thee for a monkey some twilight when I have newly changed my coat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We be one blood, thou and I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>Mowgli answered. <div class="bookquote">``I take my life from
thee tonight. My kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry, O Kaa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All thanks, Little Brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>said Kaa, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) eyes twinkled. <div class="bookquote">``And
what may so bold a hunter kill? I ask that I may follow when next he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>)
goes abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I kill nothing,--I am too little,--but I drive goats toward such as can
use them. When thou art empty come to me and see if I speak the truth.
I have some skill in these -LSB-he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) hands-RSB-, and if ever thou art
in a trap, I may pay the debt which I owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to
Baloo, here. Good hunting to ye all, my masters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>growled Baloo, for Mowgli had returned thanks very
prettily. The Python dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head lightly for a minute on Mowgli's
shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``A brave heart and a courteous tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``They shall
carry thee far through the jungle, manling. But now go hence quickly
with thy friends. Go and sleep, for the moon sets, and what follows it
is not well that thou shouldst see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>monkeys</b></font>)</div><p/>The moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of trembling monkeys
huddled together on the walls and battlements looked like ragged shaky
fringes of things. Baloo went down to the tank for a drink and Bagheera
began to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) fur in order, as Kaa glided out into the center of the
terrace and brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) jaws together with a ringing snap that drew all
the monkeys' eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The moon sets,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Is there yet light enough to see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>From the walls came a moan like the wind in the tree-tops--<div class="bookquote">``We see, O
Kaa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. Begins now the dance--the Dance of the Hunger of Kaa. Sit still
and watch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) turned twice or thrice in a big circle, weaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head from right
to left. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) began making loops and figures of eight with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
body, and soft, oozy triangles that melted into squares and five-sided
figures, and coiled mounds, never resting, never hurrying, and never
stopping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) low humming song. It grew darker and darker, till at last
the dragging, shifting coils disappeared, but they could hear the rustle
of the scales.

<p/>Baloo and Bagheera stood still as stone, growling in their throats,
their neck hair bristling, and Mowgli watched and wondered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bandar-log,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the voice of Kaa at last, <div class="bookquote">``can ye stir foot or hand
without my order? Speak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without thy order we cannot stir foot or hand, O Kaa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! Come all one pace nearer to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the monkeys</b></font>)</div><p/>The lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly, and Baloo and
Bagheera took one stiff step forward with them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearer!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kaa</b></font>)</div>hissed Kaa, and they all moved again.

<p/>Mowgli laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) hands on Baloo and Bagheera to get them away, and the
two great beasts started as though they had been waked from a dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep thy hand on my shoulder,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bagheera whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Keep it there, or I
must go back--must go back to Kaa. Aah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only old Kaa making circles on the dust,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``Let us
go.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the three slipped off through a gap in the walls to the jungle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whoof!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) stood under the still trees again. <div class="bookquote">``Never
more will I make an ally of Kaa,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) shook himself all over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) knows more than we,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, trembling. <div class="bookquote">``In a little time,
had I stayed, I should have walked down his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) throat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Many will walk by that road before the moon rises again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) will have good hunting--after his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) own fashion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what was the meaning of it all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, who did not know
anything of a python's powers of fascination. <div class="bookquote">``I saw no more than a big
snake making foolish circles till the dark came. And his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) nose was all
sore. Ho! Ho!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mowgli,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera angrily, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) nose was sore on thy account, as
my ears and sides and paws, and Baloo's neck and shoulders are bitten
on thy account. Neither Baloo nor Bagheera will be able to hunt with
pleasure for many days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div>said Baloo; <div class="bookquote">``we have the man-cub again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) has cost us heavily in time which might have been spent in
good hunting, in wounds, in hair--I am half plucked along my back--and
last of all, in honor. For, remember, Mowgli, I, who am the Black
Panther, was forced to call upon Kaa for protection, and Baloo and I
were both made stupid as little birds by the Hunger Dance. All this,
man-cub, came of thy playing with the Bandar-log.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, it is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli sorrowfully. <div class="bookquote">``I am an evil man-cub, and
my stomach is sad in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mf! What says the Law of the Jungle, Baloo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baloo</b></font>)</div><p/>Baloo did not wish to bring Mowgli into any more trouble, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could
not tamper with the Law, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) mumbled: <div class="bookquote">``Sorrow never stays punishment.
But remember, Bagheera, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) is very little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will remember. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now.
Mowgli, hast thou anything to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. I did wrong. Baloo and thou are wounded. It is just.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Bagheera gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) half a dozen love-taps from a panther's point of
view -LRB-they would hardly have waked one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) own cubs-RRB-, but for a
seven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could
wish to avoid. When it was all over Mowgli sneezed, and picked himself
up without a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bagheera, <div class="bookquote">``jump on my back, Little Brother, and we will go
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the beauties of Jungle Law is that punishment settles all scores.
There is no nagging afterward.

<p/>Mowgli laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head down on Bagheera's back and slept so deeply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
never waked when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was put down in the home-cave.




<p/>Road-Song of the Bandar-Log

<p/>Here we go in a flung festoon,
Half-way up to the jealous moon!
Don't you envy our pranceful bands?
Don't you wish you had extra hands?
Wouldn't you like if your tails were--so--
Curved in the shape of a Cupid's bow?
Now you're angry, but--never mind,
Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!

<p/>Here we sit in a branchy row,
Thinking of beautiful things we know;
Dreaming of deeds that we mean to do,
All complete, in a minute or two--
Something noble and wise and good,
Done by merely wishing we could.
We've forgotten, but--never mind,
Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!

<p/>All the talk we ever have heard
Uttered by bat or beast or bird--
Hide or fin or scale or feather--
Jabber it quickly and all together!
Excellent! Wonderful! Once again!

<p/>Now we are talking just like men!
Let's pretend we are ... never mind,
Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!
This is the way of the Monkey-kind.

<p/>Then join our leaping lines that scumfish through the pines,
That rocket by where, light and high, the wild grape swings.
By the rubbish in our wake, and the noble noise we make,
Be sure, be sure, we're going to do some splendid things!




<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tiger! Tiger!''

 (<font color='red'><b>hunter</b></font>)</div><p/>What of the hunting, hunter bold?
Brother, the watch was long and cold.
What of the quarry ye went to kill?
Brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) crops in the jungle still.
Where is the power that made your pride?
Brother, it ebbs from my flank and side.
Where is the haste that ye hurry by?
Brother, I go to my lair--to die.

<p/>Now we must go back to the first tale. When Mowgli left the wolf's cave
after the fight with the Pack at the Council Rock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) went down to the
plowed lands where the villagers lived, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) would not stop there
because it was too near to the jungle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had made at
least one bad enemy at the Council. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) hurried on, keeping to
the rough road that ran down the valley, and followed it at a steady
jog-trot for nearly twenty miles, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) came to a country that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
did not know. The valley opened out into a great plain dotted over with
rocks and cut up by ravines. At one end stood a little village, and at
the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds,
and stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe. All over the
plain, cattle and buffaloes were grazing, and when the little boys in
charge of the herds saw Mowgli they shouted and ran away, and the yellow
pariah dogs that hang about every Indian village barked. Mowgli walked
on, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was feeling hungry, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) came to the village gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
saw the big thorn-bush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight,
pushed to one side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Umph!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had come across more than one such barricade in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) night rambles after things to eat. <div class="bookquote">``So men are afraid of the People
of the Jungle here also.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) sat down by the gate, and when a man came
out he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood up, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth, and pointed down it to show that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted food. The man stared, and ran back up the one street of the
village shouting for the priest, who was a big, fat man dressed in
white, with a red and yellow mark on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead. The priest came to
the gate, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) at least a hundred people, who stared and talked
and shouted and pointed at Mowgli.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have no manners, these Men Folk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli to himself. <div class="bookquote">``Only
the gray ape would behave as they do.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) long hair
and frowned at the crowd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there to be afraid of?''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>said the priest. <div class="bookquote">``Look at the marks on
his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) arms and legs. They are the bites of wolves. He (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) is but a wolf-child
run away from the jungle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course, in playing together, the cubs had often nipped Mowgli harder
than they intended, and there were white scars all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) arms and
legs. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) would have been the last person in the world to call these
bites, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) knew what real biting meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Arre! Arre!''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>said two or three women together. <div class="bookquote">``To be bitten by wolves,
poor child! He (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) is a handsome boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) has eyes like red fire. By my
honor, Messua, he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the tiger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me look,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>said a woman with heavy copper rings on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrists and
ankles, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) peered at Mowgli under the palm of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>)
is not. He (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) is thinner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) has the very look of my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The priest</b></font>)</div><p/>The priest was a clever man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) knew that Messua was wife to the
richest villager in the place. So he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) looked up at the sky for a minute
and said solemnly: <div class="bookquote">``What the jungle has taken the jungle has restored.
Take the boy into thy house, my sister, and forget not to honor the
priest who sees so far into the lives of men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the Bull that bought me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli to himself, <div class="bookquote">``but all this
talking is like another looking-over by the Pack! Well, if I am a man, a
man I must become.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>The crowd parted as the woman beckoned Mowgli to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hut, where there
was a red lacquered bedstead, a great earthen grain chest with funny
raised patterns on it, half a dozen copper cooking pots, an image of a
Hindu god in a little alcove, and on the wall a real looking glass, such
as they sell at the country fairs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) a long drink of milk and some bread, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) head and looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) eyes; for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought perhaps that
he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) might be her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) real son come back from the jungle where the tiger had
taken him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Nathoo, O Nathoo!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mowgli did not show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
knew the name. <div class="bookquote">``Dost thou not remember the day when I gave thee thy new
shoes?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) foot, and it was almost as hard as horn. <div class="bookquote">``No,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said sorrowfully, <div class="bookquote">``those feet have never worn shoes, but thou art
very like my Nathoo, and thou shalt be my son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli was uneasy, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had never been under a roof before. But as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) looked at the thatch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could tear it out any time if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
wanted to get away, and that the window had no fastenings. <div class="bookquote">``What is the
good of a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said to himself at last, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not understand
man's talk? Now I am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the
jungle. I must speak their talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not for fun that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had learned while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was with the wolves to
imitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little
wild pig. So, as soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate
it almost perfectly, and before dark he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had learned the names of many
things in the hut.

<p/>There was a difficulty at bedtime, because Mowgli would not sleep under
anything that looked so like a panther trap as that hut, and when they
shut the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) went through the window. <div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Messua</b></font>)</div>said
Messua's husband. <div class="bookquote">``Remember he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can never till now have slept on a bed.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is indeed sent in the place of our son he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will not run away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>So Mowgli stretched himself in some long, clean grass at the edge of
the field, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) eyes a soft gray nose poked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
under the chin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phew!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gray Brother</b></font>)</div>said Gray Brother -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) was the eldest of Mother Wolf's cubs-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles. Thou smellest
of wood smoke and cattle--altogether like a man already. Wake, Little
Brother; I bring news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are all well in the jungle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, hugging him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All except the wolves that were burned with the Red Flower. Now,
listen. Shere Khan has gone away to hunt far off till his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) coat grows
again, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) is badly singed. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) returns he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) swears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) will
lay thy bones in the Waingunga.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two words to that. I also have made a little promise. But
news is always good. I am tired to-night,--very tired with new things,
Gray Brother,--but bring me the news always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf? Men will not make thee
forget?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gray</b></font>)</div>said Gray Brother anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never. I will always remember that I love thee and all in our cave. But
also I will always remember that I have been cast out of the Pack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that thou mayest be cast out of another pack. Men are only men,
Little Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond. When
I come down here again, I will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge
of the grazing-ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>For three months after that night Mowgli hardly ever left the village
gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was so busy learning the ways and customs of men. First he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had
to wear a cloth round him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>), which annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) horribly; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had
to learn about money, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) did not in the least understand, and
about plowing, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) did not see the use. Then the little children
in the village made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) very angry. Luckily, the Law of the Jungle had
taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) temper, for in the jungle life and food depend on
keeping your temper; but when they made fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) would not
play games or fly kites, or because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) mispronounced some word, only the
knowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
from picking them up and breaking them in two.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) did not know his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) own strength in the least. In the jungle he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
was weak compared with the beasts, but in the village people said that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was as strong as a bull.

<p/>And Mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes
between man and man. When the potter's donkey slipped in the clay pit,
Mowgli hauled it out by the tail, and helped to stack the pots for their
journey to the market at Khanhiwara. That was very shocking, too, for
the potter is a low-caste man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) donkey is worse. When the priest
scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mowgli threatened to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) on the donkey too, and the
priest told Messua's husband that Mowgli had better be set to work as
soon as possible; and the village head-man told Mowgli that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) would
have to go out with the buffaloes next day, and herd them while they
grazed. No one was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
had been appointed a servant of the village, as it were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) went off
to a circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great
fig-tree. It was the village club, and the head-man and the watchman and
the barber, who knew all the gossip of the village, and old Buldeo, the
village hunter, who had a Tower musket, met and smoked. The monkeys
sat and talked in the upper branches, and there was a hole under the
platform where a cobra lived, and he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) little platter of milk
every night because he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) was sacred; and the old men sat around the tree
and talked, and pulled at the big huqas -LRB-the water-pipes-RRB- till far into
the night. They told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts; and
Buldeo told even more wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the
jungle, till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle bulged
out of their heads. Most of the tales were about animals, for the jungle
was always at their door. The deer and the wild pig grubbed up their
crops, and now and again the tiger carried off a man at twilight, within
sight of the village gates.

<p/>Mowgli, who naturally knew something about what they were talking of,
had to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) face not to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was laughing, while Buldeo,
the Tower musket across his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) knees, climbed on from one wonderful story
to another, and Mowgli's shoulders shook.

<p/>Buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away Messua's son
was a ghost-tiger, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked,
old money-lender, who had died some years ago. <div class="bookquote">``And I know that this is
true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``because Purun Dass always limped from the blow that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>)
got in a riot when his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) account books were burned, and the tiger that I
speak of he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) limps, too, for the tracks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) pads are unequal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, true, that must be the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the gray-beards, nodding
together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``That
tiger limps because he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) was born lame, as everyone knows. To talk of the
soul of a money-lender in a beast that never had the courage of a jackal
is child's talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Buldeo</b></font>)</div><p/>Buldeo was speechless with surprise for a moment, and the head-man
stared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oho! It is the jungle brat, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Buldeo</b></font>)</div>said Buldeo. <div class="bookquote">``If thou art so
wise, better bring his (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) hide to Khanhiwara, for the Government has set
a hundred rupees on his (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) life. Better still, talk not when thy elders
speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli rose to go. <div class="bookquote">``All the evening I have lain here listening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
called back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``and, except once or twice, Buldeo has
not said one word of truth concerning the jungle, which is at his (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) very
doors. How, then, shall I believe the tales of ghosts and gods and
goblins which he (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) has seen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is full time that boy went to herding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Buldeo</b></font>)</div>said the head-man, while
Buldeo puffed and snorted at Mowgli's impertinence.

<p/>The custom of most Indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle
and buffaloes out to graze in the early morning, and bring them back
at night. The very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow
themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that
hardly come up to their noses. So long as the boys keep with the herds
they are safe, for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle. But
if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards, they are sometimes
carried off. Mowgli went through the village street in the dawn, sitting
on the back of Rama, the great herd bull. The slaty-blue buffaloes,
with their long, backward-sweeping horns and savage eyes, rose out their
byres, one by one, and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Rama</b></font>), and Mowgli made it very clear to
the children with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was the master. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) beat the buffaloes with
a long, polished bamboo, and told Kamya, one of the boys, to graze the
cattle by themselves, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) went on with the buffaloes, and to be
very careful not to stray away from the herd.

<p/>An Indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little
ravines, among which the herds scatter and disappear. The buffaloes
generally keep to the pools and muddy places, where they lie wallowing
or basking in the warm mud for hours. Mowgli drove them on to the edge
of the plain where the Waingunga came out of the jungle; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) dropped
from Rama's neck, trotted off to a bamboo clump, and found Gray Brother.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gray Brother</b></font>)</div>said Gray Brother, <div class="bookquote">``I have waited here very many days. What is the
meaning of this cattle-herding work?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gray Brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is an order,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``I am a village herd for a while. What
news of Shere Khan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has come back to this country, and has waited here a long time for
thee. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has gone off again, for the game is scarce. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) means to
kill thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``So long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) is away do thou or one of the
four brothers sit on that rock, so that I can see thee as I come out of
the village. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhak
tree in the center of the plain. We need not walk into Shere Khan's
mouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mowgli picked out a shady place, and lay down and slept while
the buffaloes grazed round him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>). Herding in India is one of the laziest
things in the world. The cattle move and crunch, and lie down, and move
on again, and they do not even low. They only grunt, and the buffaloes
very seldom say anything, but get down into the muddy pools one after
another, and work their way into the mud till only their noses and
staring china-blue eyes show above the surface, and then they lie like
logs. The sun makes the rocks dance in the heat, and the herd children
hear one kite -LRB-never any more-RRB- whistling almost out of sight overhead,
and they know that if they died, or a cow died, that kite would sweep
down, and the next kite miles away would see him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) drop and follow, and
the next, and the next, and almost before they were dead there would be
a score of hungry kites come out of nowhere. Then they sleep and
wake and sleep again, and weave little baskets of dried grass and put
grasshoppers in them; or catch two praying mantises and make them fight;
or string a necklace of red and black jungle nuts; or watch a lizard
basking on a rock, or a snake hunting a frog near the wallows. Then they
sing long, long songs with odd native quavers at the end of them, and
the day seems longer than most people's whole lives, and perhaps they
make a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes, and
put reeds into the men's hands, and pretend that they are kings and the
figures are their armies, or that they are gods to be worshiped. Then
evening comes and the children call, and the buffaloes lumber up out of
the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after the other,
and they all string across the gray plain back to the twinkling village
lights.

<p/>Day after day Mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows, and
day after day he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) would see Gray Brother's back a mile and a half away
across the plain -LRB-so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) knew that Shere Khan had not come back-RRB-, and day
after day he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) would lie on the grass listening to the noises round him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>),
and dreaming of old days in the jungle. If Shere Khan had made a false
step with his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) lame paw up in the jungles by the Waingunga, Mowgli would
have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) in those long, still mornings.

<p/>At last a day came when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) did not see Gray Brother at the signal place,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhk tree,
which was all covered with golden-red flowers. There sat Gray Brother,
every bristle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) back lifted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) crossed the
ranges last night with Tabaqui, hot-foot on thy trail,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Wolf/Wolf</b></font>)</div>said the Wolf,
panting.

<p/>Mowgli frowned. <div class="bookquote">``I am not afraid of Shere Khan, but Tabaqui is very
cunning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have no fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gray Brother</b></font>)</div>said Gray Brother, licking his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) lips a little. <div class="bookquote">``I met
Tabaqui in the dawn. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) is telling all his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) wisdom to the kites, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) told me everything before I broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) back. Shere Khan's plan is to
wait for thee at the village gate this evening--for thee and for no one
else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) is lying up now, in the big dry ravine of the Waingunga.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) eaten today, or does he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) hunt empty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, for the answer
meant life and death to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) killed at dawn,--a pig,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) has drunk too. Remember, Shere Khan
could never fast, even for the sake of revenge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Fool, fool! What a cub's cub it is! Eaten and drunk too, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
thinks that I shall wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has slept! Now, where does he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) lie up?
If there were but ten of us we might pull him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) down as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) lies. These
buffaloes will not charge unless they wind him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), and I cannot speak their
language. Can we get behind his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) track so that they may smell it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) swam far down the Waingunga to cut that off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gray Brother</b></font>)</div>said Gray Brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tabaqui told him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) that, I know. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) would never have thought of it
alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>Mowgli stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) finger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) mouth, thinking. <div class="bookquote">``The big
ravine of the Waingunga. That opens out on the plain not half a mile
from here. I can take the herd round through the jungle to the head of
the ravine and then sweep down--but he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) would slink out at the foot. We
must block that end. Gray Brother, canst thou cut the herd in two for
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I, perhaps--but I have brought a wise helper.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gray</b></font>)</div>Gray Brother trotted
off and dropped into a hole. Then there lifted up a huge gray head that
Mowgli knew well, and the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry
of all the jungle--the hunting howl of a wolf at midday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Akela! Akela!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``I might have known
that thou wouldst not forget me. We have a big work in hand. Cut the
herd in two, Akela. Keep the cows and calves together, and the bulls and
the plow buffaloes by themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The wolves</b></font>)</div><p/>The two wolves ran, ladies'-chain fashion, in and out of the herd, which
snorted and threw up its head, and separated into two clumps. In one,
the cow-buffaloes stood with their calves in the center, and glared
and pawed, ready, if a wolf would only stay still, to charge down and
trample the life out of him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>). In the other, the bulls and the young bulls
snorted and stamped, but though they looked more imposing they were much
less dangerous, for they had no calves to protect. No six men could have
divided the herd so neatly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What orders!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>panted Akela. <div class="bookquote">``They are trying to join again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli slipped on to Rama's back. <div class="bookquote">``Drive the bulls away to the left,
Akela. Gray Brother, when we are gone, hold the cows together, and drive
them into the foot of the ravine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How far?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gray Brother</b></font>)</div>said Gray Brother, panting and snapping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Till the sides are higher than Shere Khan can jump,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>shouted Mowgli.
<div class="bookquote">``Keep them there till we come down.''  (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div>The bulls swept off as Akela bayed,
and Gray Brother stopped in front of the cows. They charged down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) ran just before them to the foot of the ravine, as Akela drove
the bulls far to the left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done! Another charge and they are fairly started. Careful,
now--careful, Akela. A snap too much and the bulls will charge. Hujah!
This is wilder work than driving black-buck. Didst thou think these
creatures could move so swiftly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>Mowgli called.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have--have hunted these too in my time,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>gasped Akela in the dust.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall I turn them into the jungle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! Turn. Swiftly turn them! Rama is mad with rage. Oh, if I could only
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rama</b></font>) what I need of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rama</b></font>) to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The bulls were turned, to the right this time, and crashed into the
standing thicket. The other herd children, watching with the cattle half
a mile away, hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry
them, crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away.

<p/>But Mowgli's plan was simple enough. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) wanted to do was to make a
big circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine, and then take the
bulls down it and catch Shere Khan between the bulls and the cows; for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) knew that after a meal and a full drink Shere Khan would not be in
any condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of the ravine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) was
soothing the buffaloes now by voice, and Akela had dropped far to the
rear, only whimpering once or twice to hurry the rear-guard. It was a
long, long circle, for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and
give Shere Khan warning. At last Mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd
at the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to
the ravine itself. From that height you could see across the tops of the
trees down to the plain below; but what Mowgli looked at was the sides
of the ravine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) saw with a great deal of satisfaction that they
ran nearly straight up and down, while the vines and creepers that hung
over them would give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let them breathe, Akela,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said, holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``They have not
winded him (<font color='blue'><b>Rama</b></font>) yet. Let them breathe. I must tell Shere Khan who comes. We
have him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) in the trap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) hands to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) mouth and shouted down the ravine--it was almost
like shouting down a tunnel--and the echoes jumped from rock to rock.

<p/>After a long time there came back the drawling, sleepy snarl of a
full-fed tiger just wakened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who calls?''  (<font color='red'><b>Shere Khan/SHERE KHAN</b></font>)</div>said Shere Khan, and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of
the ravine screeching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I, Mowgli. Cattle thief, it is time to come to the Council Rock!
Down--hurry them down, Akela! Down, Rama, down!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div><p/>The herd paused for an instant at the edge of the slope, but Akela gave
tongue in the full hunting-yell, and they pitched over one after the
other, just as steamers shoot rapids, the sand and stones spurting up
round them. Once started, there was no chance of stopping, and before
they were fairly in the bed of the ravine Rama winded Shere Khan and
bellowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``Now thou knowest!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the torrent
of black horns, foaming muzzles, and staring eyes whirled down the
ravine just as boulders go down in floodtime; the weaker buffaloes being
shouldered out to the sides of the ravine where they tore through the
creepers. They knew what the business was before them--the terrible
charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand.
Shere Khan heard the thunder of their hoofs, picked himself up, and
lumbered down the ravine, looking from side to side for some way of
escape, but the walls of the ravine were straight and he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) had to hold on,
heavy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) dinner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) drink, willing to do anything rather than
fight. The herd splashed through the pool he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) had just left, bellowing
till the narrow cut rang. Mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot
of the ravine, saw Shere Khan turn -LRB-the tiger knew if the worst came
to the worst it was better to meet the bulls than the cows with their
calves-RRB-, and then Rama tripped, stumbled, and went on again over
something soft, and, with the bulls at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rama</b></font>) heels, crashed full into the
other herd, while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet
by the shock of the meeting. That charge carried both herds out into the
plain, goring and stamping and snorting. Mowgli watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) time, and
slipped off Rama's neck, laying about him (<font color='blue'><b>Rama</b></font>) right and left with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rama</b></font>) stick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick, Akela! Break them up. Scatter them, or they will be fighting one
another. Drive them away, Akela. Hai, Rama! Hai, hai, hai! my children.
Softly now, softly! It is all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div><p/>Akela and Gray Brother ran to and fro nipping the buffaloes' legs,
and though the herd wheeled once to charge up the ravine again, Mowgli
managed to turn Rama, and the others followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) to the wallows.

<p/>Shere Khan needed no more trampling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) was dead, and the kites were
coming for him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) already.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brothers, that was a dog's death,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, feeling for the knife
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) always carried in a sheath round his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) neck now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) lived with men.
<div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Rama</b></font>) would never have shown fight. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rama</b></font>) hide will look well on the
Council Rock. We must get to work swiftly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A boy</b></font>)</div><p/>A boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a ten-foot
tiger alone, but Mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animal's
skin is fitted on, and how it can be taken off. But it was hard work,
and Mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour, while the wolves
lolled out their tongues, or came forward and tugged as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) ordered them.
Presently a hand fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) shoulder, and looking up he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) saw Buldeo with
the Tower musket. The children had told the village about the buffalo
stampede, and Buldeo went out angrily, only too anxious to correct
Mowgli for not taking better care of the herd. The wolves dropped out of
sight as soon as they saw the man coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this folly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Buldeo</b></font>)</div>said Buldeo angrily. <div class="bookquote">``To think that thou canst
skin a tiger! Where did the buffaloes kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Rama</b></font>)? It is the Lame Tiger
too, and there is a hundred rupees on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rama</b></font>) head. Well, well, we will
overlook thy letting the herd run off, and perhaps I will give thee one
of the rupees of the reward when I have taken the skin to Khanhiwara.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fumbled in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waist cloth for flint and steel, and stooped down to
singe Shere Khan's whiskers. Most native hunters always singe a tiger's
whiskers to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) ghost from haunting them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, half to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) ripped back the skin of a
forepaw. <div class="bookquote">``So thou wilt take the hide to Khanhiwara for the reward, and
perhaps give me one rupee? Now it is in my mind that I need the skin for
my own use. Heh! Old man, take away that fire!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What talk is this to the chief hunter of the village? Thy luck and the
stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill. The tiger has
just fed, or he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) would have gone twenty miles by this time. Thou canst
not even skin him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) properly, little beggar brat, and forsooth I, Buldeo,
must be told not to singe his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) whiskers. Mowgli, I will not give thee one
anna of the reward, but only a very big beating. Leave the carcass!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the Bull that bought me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, who was trying to get at the
shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``must I stay babbling to an old ape all noon? Here, Akela,
this man plagues me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Buldeo, who was still stooping over Shere Khan's head, found himself
sprawling on the grass, with a gray wolf standing over him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>), while Mowgli
went on skinning as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) were alone in all India.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Thou art altogether right, Buldeo.
Thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward. There is an old war
between this lame tiger and myself--a very old war, and--I have won.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To do Buldeo justice, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had been ten years younger he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) would have
taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) chance with Akela had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) met the wolf in the woods, but a wolf
who obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with man-eating
tigers was not a common animal. It was sorcery, magic of the worst kind,
thought Buldeo, and he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) wondered whether the amulet round his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) neck would
protect him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) lay as still as still, expecting every minute to see
Mowgli turn into a tiger too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maharaj! Great King,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said at last in a husky whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head, chuckling a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am an old man. I did not know that thou wast anything more than a
herdsboy. May I rise up and go away, or will thy servant tear me to
pieces?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, and peace go with thee. Only, another time do not meddle with my
game. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) go, Akela.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Buldeo</b></font>)</div><p/>Buldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) could, looking back
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) shoulder in case Mowgli should change into something terrible.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) got to the village he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) told a tale of magic and enchantment and
sorcery that made the priest look very grave.

<p/>Mowgli went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) work, but it was nearly twilight before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) and
the wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home! Help me to herd
them, Akela.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>The herd rounded up in the misty twilight, and when they got near the
village Mowgli saw lights, and heard the conches and bells in the temple
blowing and banging. Half the village seemed to be waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
by the gate. <div class="bookquote">``That is because I have killed Shere Khan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) said
to himself. But a shower of stones whistled about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) ears, and the
villagers shouted: <div class="bookquote">``Sorcerer! Wolf's brat! Jungle demon! Go away! Get
hence quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again. Shoot,
Buldeo, shoot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the villagers</b></font>)</div><p/>The old Tower musket went off with a bang, and a young buffalo bellowed
in pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More sorcery!''  (<font color='red'><b>the villagers</b></font>)</div>shouted the villagers. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) can turn bullets. Buldeo,
that was thy buffalo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now what is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli, bewildered, as the stones flew thicker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not unlike the Pack, these brothers of thine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div>said Akela,
sitting down composedly. <div class="bookquote">``It is in my head that, if bullets mean
anything, they would cast thee out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wolf! Wolf's cub! Go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>shouted the priest, waving a sprig of the
sacred tulsi plant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Again? Last time it was because I was a man. This time it is because I
am a wolf. Let us go, Akela.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div><p/>A woman--it was Messua--ran across to the herd, and cried: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my son,
my son! They say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast
at will. I do not believe, but go away or they will kill thee. Buldeo
says thou art a wizard, but I know thou hast avenged Nathoo's death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Messua</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come back, Messua!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted the crowd. <div class="bookquote">``Come back, or we will stone
thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Mowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh, for a stone had hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) in
the mouth. <div class="bookquote">``Run back, Messua. This is one of the foolish tales they tell
under the big tree at dusk. I have at least paid for thy son's life.
Farewell; and run quickly, for I shall send the herd in more swiftly
than their brickbats. I am no wizard, Messua. Farewell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, once more, Akela,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Bring the herd in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village. They hardly
needed Akela's yell, but charged through the gate like a whirlwind,
scattering the crowd right and left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep count!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>shouted Mowgli scornfully. <div class="bookquote">``It may be that I have stolen
one of them. Keep count, for I will do your herding no more. Fare you
well, children of men, and thank Messua that I do not come in with my
wolves and hunt you up and down your street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) heel and walked away with the Lone Wolf, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>)
looked up at the stars he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) felt happy. <div class="bookquote">``No more sleeping in traps for me,
Akela. Let us get Shere Khan's skin and go away. No, we will not hurt
the village, for Messua was kind to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the villagers</b></font>)</div><p/>When the moon rose over the plain, making it look all milky, the
horrified villagers saw Mowgli, with two wolves at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) heels and a
bundle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) head, trotting across at the steady wolf's trot that eats
up the long miles like fire. Then they banged the temple bells and blew
the conches louder than ever. And Messua cried, and Buldeo embroidered
the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) adventures in the jungle, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) ended by saying that
Akela stood up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) hind legs and talked like a man.

<p/>The moon was just going down when Mowgli and the two wolves came to the
hill of the Council Rock, and they stopped at Mother Wolf's cave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have cast me out from the Man-Pack, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>shouted Mowgli, <div class="bookquote">``but
I come with the hide of Shere Khan to keep my word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div><p/>Mother Wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Messua</b></font>), and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Messua</b></font>) eyes glowed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Messua</b></font>) saw the skin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) on that day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) crammed his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) head and shoulders into
this cave, hunting for thy life, Little Frog--I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) that the hunter
would be the hunted. It is well done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Little Brother, it is well done,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a deep voice in the thicket.
<div class="bookquote">``We were lonely in the jungle without thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>and Bagheera came running
to Mowgli's bare feet. They clambered up the Council Rock together, and
Mowgli spread the skin out on the flat stone where Akela used to sit,
and pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo, and Akela lay down upon
it, and called the old call to the Council, <div class="bookquote">``Look--look well, O Wolves,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Akela</b></font>)</div>exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had called when Mowgli was first brought there.

<p/>Ever since Akela had been deposed, the Pack had been without a leader,
hunting and fighting at their own pleasure. But they answered the call
from habit; and some of them were lame from the traps they had fallen
into, and some limped from shot wounds, and some were mangy from eating
bad food, and many were missing. But they came to the Council Rock, all
that were left of them, and saw Shere Khan's striped hide on the rock,
and the huge claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet. It
was then that Mowgli made up a song that came up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) throat all
by itself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) shouted it aloud, leaping up and down on the rattling
skin, and beating time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) heels till he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) had no more breath left,
while Gray Brother and Akela howled between the verses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look well, O Wolves. Have I kept my word?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. And the wolves
bayed <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wolves</b></font>)</div>and one tattered wolf howled:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lead us again, O Akela. Lead us again, O Man-cub, for we be sick of
this lawlessness, and we would be the Free People once more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wolf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>purred Bagheera, <div class="bookquote">``that may not be. When ye are full-fed, the
madness may come upon you again. Not for nothing are ye called the Free
People. Ye fought for freedom, and it is yours. Eat it, O Wolves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Man-Pack and Wolf-Pack have cast me out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)</div>said Mowgli. <div class="bookquote">``Now I will hunt
alone in the jungle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And we will hunt with thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the four cubs.

<p/>So Mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from
that day on. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) was not always alone, because, years afterward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
became a man and married.

<p/>But that is a story for grown-ups.




<p/>Mowgli's Song

<p/>THAT HE (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) SANG AT THE COUNCIL ROCK WHEN HE (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>)
DANCED ON SHERE KHAN'S HIDE

<p/>The Song of Mowgli--I, Mowgli, am singing. Let the jungle
listen to the things I have done.

<p/>Shere Khan said he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) would kill--would kill! At the gates in the
twilight he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) would kill Mowgli, the Frog!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) ate and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mowgli</b></font>) drank. Drink deep, Shere Khan, for when wilt thou
drink again? Sleep and dream of the kill.

<p/>I am alone on the grazing-grounds. Gray Brother, come to me!
Come to me, Lone Wolf, for there is big game afoot!

<p/>Bring up the great bull buffaloes, the blue-skinned herd bulls
with the angry eyes. Drive them to and fro as I order.

<p/>Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan? Wake, oh, wake! Here come I,
and the bulls are behind.

<p/>Rama, the King of the Buffaloes, stamped with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) foot. Waters of
the Waingunga, whither went Shere Khan?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) is not Ikki to dig holes, nor Mao, the Peacock, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) should
fly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) is not Mang the Bat, to hang in the branches. Little
bamboos that creak together, tell me where he (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) ran?

<p/>Ow! He (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) is there. Ahoo! He (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) is there. Under the feet of Rama
lies the Lame One! Up, Shere Khan!

<p/>Up and kill! Here is meat; break the necks of the bulls!

<p/>Hsh! He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) is asleep. We will not wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) strength is
very great. The kites have come down to see it. The black
ants have come up to know it. There is a great assembly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>)
honor.

<p/>Alala! I have no cloth to wrap me. The kites will see that I am
naked. I am ashamed to meet all these people.

<p/>Lend me thy coat, Shere Khan. Lend me thy gay striped coat that I
may go to the Council Rock.

<p/>By the Bull that bought me I made a promise--a little promise.
Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.

<p/>With the knife, with the knife that men use, with the knife of the
hunter, I will stoop down for my gift.

<p/>Waters of the Waingunga, Shere Khan gives me his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) coat for the love
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) bears me. Pull, Gray Brother! Pull, Akela! Heavy is
the hide of Shere Khan.

<p/>The Man Pack are angry. They throw stones and talk child's talk.
My mouth is bleeding. Let me run away.

<p/>Through the night, through the hot night, run swiftly with me, my
brothers. We will leave the lights of the village and go to
the low moon.

<p/>Waters of the Waingunga, the Man-Pack have cast me out. I did
them no harm, but they were afraid of me. Why?

<p/>Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too. The jungle is shut to me and
the village gates are shut. Why?

<p/>As Mang flies between the beasts and birds, so fly I between the
village and the jungle. Why?

<p/>I dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is very heavy. My
mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village, but
my heart is very light, because I have come back to the jungle.
Why?

<p/>These two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the
spring. The water comes out of my eyes; yet I laugh while it
falls. Why?

<p/>I am two Mowglis, but the hide of Shere Khan is under my feet.

<p/>All the jungle knows that I have killed Shere Khan. Look--look
well, O Wolves!

<p/>Ahae! My heart is heavy with the things that I do not understand.




<p/>The White Seal

<p/>Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,
And black are the waters that sparkled so green.
The moon, o’er the combers, looks downward to find us
At rest in the hollows that rustle between.
Where billow meets billow, then soft be thy pillow,
Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!
The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,
Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas!

<p/>Seal Lullaby


<p/>All these things happened several years ago at a place called
Novastoshnah, or North East Point, on the Island of St. Paul, away and
away in the Bering Sea. Limmershin, the Winter Wren, told me the tale
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wren</b></font>) was blown on to the rigging of a steamer going to Japan, and I
took him (<font color='blue'><b>Wren</b></font>) down into my cabin and warmed and fed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wren</b></font>) for a couple of days
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Wren</b></font>) was fit to fly back to St. Paul's again. Limmershin is a very
quaint little bird, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knows how to tell the truth.

<p/>Nobody comes to Novastoshnah except on business, and the only people
who have regular business there are the seals. They come in the summer
months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea.
For Novastoshnah Beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any
place in all the world.

<p/>Sea Catch knew that, and every spring would swim from whatever place
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) happened to be in--would swim like a torpedo-boat straight for
Novastoshnah and spend a month fighting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) companions for a good
place on the rocks, as close to the sea as possible. Sea Catch was
fifteen years old, a huge gray fur seal with almost a mane on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
shoulders, and long, wicked dog teeth. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heaved himself up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
front flippers he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood more than four feet clear of the ground, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
weight, if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), was nearly seven
hundred pounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was always ready for just one fight more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would put his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head
on one side, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were afraid to look his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) enemy in the face;
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would shoot it out like lightning, and when the big teeth were
firmly fixed on the other seal's neck, the other seal might get away if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could, but Sea Catch would not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>Yet Sea Catch never chased a beaten seal, for that was against the Rules
of the Beach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) only wanted room by the sea for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) nursery. But as
there were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same
thing each spring, the whistling, bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the
beach was something frightful.

<p/>From a little hill called Hutchinson's Hill, you could look over three
and a half miles of ground covered with fighting seals; and the surf was
dotted all over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their
share of the fighting. They fought in the breakers, they fought in the
sand, and they fought on the smooth-worn basalt rocks of the nurseries,
for they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men. Their wives
never came to the island until late in May or early in June, for they
did not care to be torn to pieces; and the young two-, three-, and
four-year-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about
half a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on the
sand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green
thing that grew. They were called the holluschickie--the bachelors--and
there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at Novastoshnah
alone.

<p/>Sea Catch had just finished his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelors</b></font>) forty-fifth fight one spring when
Matkah, his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelors</b></font>) soft, sleek, gentle-eyed wife, came up out of the sea,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelors</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by the scruff of the neck and dumped her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) down on his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelors</b></font>)
reservation, saying gruffly: <div class="bookquote">``Late as usual. Where have you been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything during the four
months he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelors</b></font>) stayed on the beaches, and so his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelors</b></font>) temper was generally bad.
Matkah knew better than to answer back. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked round and cooed: <div class="bookquote">``How
thoughtful of you. You've taken the old place again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think I had,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sea Catch. <div class="bookquote">``Look at me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bachelors</b></font>) was scratched and bleeding in twenty places; one eye was almost out,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelors</b></font>) sides were torn to ribbons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you men, you men!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matkah</b></font>)</div>Matkah said, fanning herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hind
flipper. <div class="bookquote">``Why can't you be sensible and settle your places quietly? You
look as though you had been fighting with the Killer Whale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't been doing anything but fight since the middle of May. The
beach is disgracefully crowded this season. I've met at least a hundred
seals from Lukannon Beach, house hunting. Why can't people stay where
they belong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at Otter
Island instead of this crowded place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matkah</b></font>)</div>said Matkah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! Only the holluschickie go to Otter Island. If we went there they
would say we were afraid. We must preserve appearances, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sea Catch sunk his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelors</b></font>) head proudly between his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelors</b></font>) fat shoulders and pretended
to go to sleep for a few minutes, but all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelors</b></font>) was keeping a
sharp lookout for a fight. Now that all the seals and their wives were
on the land, you could hear their clamor miles out to sea above the
loudest gales. At the lowest counting there were over a million seals
on the beach--old seals, mother seals, tiny babies, and holluschickie,
fighting, scuffling, bleating, crawling, and playing together--going
down to the sea and coming up from it in gangs and regiments, lying
over every foot of ground as far as the eye could reach, and skirmishing
about in brigades through the fog. It is nearly always foggy at
Novastoshnah, except when the sun comes out and makes everything look
all pearly and rainbow-colored for a little while.

<p/>Kotick, Matkah's baby, was born in the middle of that confusion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
was all head and shoulders, with pale, watery blue eyes, as tiny seals
must be, but there was something about his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) coat that made his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mother
look at him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) very closely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sea Catch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, at last, <div class="bookquote">``our baby's going to be white!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Empty clam-shells and dry seaweed!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>snorted Sea Catch. <div class="bookquote">``There never has
been such a thing in the world as a white seal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matkah</b></font>)</div>said Matkah; <div class="bookquote">``there's going to be now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matkah</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
sang the low, crooning seal song that all the mother seals sing to their
babies:

<p/>You mustn't swim till you're six weeks old,
Or your head will be sunk by your heels;
And summer gales and Killer Whales
Are bad for baby seals.

<p/>Are bad for baby seals, dear rat,
As bad as bad can be;
But splash and grow strong,
And you can't be wrong.
Child of the Open Sea!

<p/>Of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
paddled and scrambled about by his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mother's side, and learned to scuffle
out of the way when his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) father was fighting with another seal, and the
two rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks. Matkah used to go
to sea to get things to eat, and the baby was fed only once in two days,
but then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ate all he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could and throve upon it.

<p/>The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did was to crawl inland, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) met tens
of thousands of babies of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own age, and they played together like
puppies, went to sleep on the clean sand, and played again. The old
people in the nurseries took no notice of them, and the holluschickie
kept to their own grounds, and the babies had a beautiful playtime.

<p/>When Matkah came back from her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) deep-sea fishing she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would go straight
to their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb, and wait until
she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) heard Kotick bleat. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would take the straightest of straight
lines in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) direction, striking out with her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fore flippers and knocking
the youngsters head over heels right and left. There were always a few
hundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds, and
the babies were kept lively. But, as Matkah told Kotick, <div class="bookquote">``So long as you
don't lie in muddy water and get mange, or rub the hard sand into a cut
or scratch, and so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy
sea, nothing will hurt you here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>Little seals can no more swim than little children, but they are unhappy
till they learn. The first time that Kotick went down to the sea a wave
carried him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) out beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) depth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) big head sank and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) little
hind flippers flew up exactly as his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mother had told him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in the song,
and if the next wave had not thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) back again he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would have
drowned.

<p/>After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the
waves just cover him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) and lift him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) up while he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) paddled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) always
kept his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eye open for big waves that might hurt. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was two weeks
learning to use his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) flippers; and all that while he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) floundered in and
out of the water, and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and
took catnaps on the sand, and went back again, until at last he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) found
that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) truly belonged to the water.

<p/>Then you can imagine the times that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) companions, ducking
under the rollers; or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a
swash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach; or
standing up on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) tail and scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head as the old people did;
or playing <div class="bookquote">``I'm the King of the Castle''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>on slippery, weedy rocks that
just stuck out of the wash. Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would see a thin fin, like
a big shark's fin, drifting along close to shore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knew that that
was the Killer Whale, the Grampus, who eats young seals when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) can get
them; and Kotick would head for the beach like an arrow, and the fin
would jig off slowly, as if it were looking for nothing at all.

<p/>Late in October the seals began to leave St. Paul's for the deep sea, by
families and tribes, and there was no more fighting over the nurseries,
and the holluschickie played anywhere they liked. <div class="bookquote">``Next year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matkah</b></font>)</div>said
Matkah to Kotick, <div class="bookquote">``you will be a holluschickie; but this year you must
learn how to catch fish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>They set out together across the Pacific, and Matkah showed Kotick how
to sleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) flippers tucked down by his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) side and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
little nose just out of the water. No cradle is so comfortable as the
long, rocking swell of the Pacific. When Kotick felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) skin tingle all
over, Matkah told him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was learning the <div class="bookquote">``feel of the water,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and that
tingly, prickly feelings meant bad weather coming, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) must swim hard
and get away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a little time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you'll know where to swim to, but just
now we'll follow Sea Pig, the Porpoise, for he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is very wise.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>A school
of porpoises were ducking and tearing through the water, and little
Kotick followed them as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">``How do you know where to go
to?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) panted. The leader of the school rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) white eye and ducked
under. <div class="bookquote">``My tail tingles, youngster,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That means there's a gale
behind me. Come along! When you're south of the Sticky Water -LSB-he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) meant
the Equator-RSB- and your tail tingles, that means there's a gale in front
of you and you must head north. Come along! The water feels bad here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>This was one of very many things that Kotick learned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was always
learning. Matkah taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to follow the cod and the halibut along the
under-sea banks and wrench the rockling out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hole among the weeds;
how to skirt the wrecks lying a hundred fathoms below water and dart
like a rifle bullet in at one porthole and out at another as the fishes
ran; how to dance on the top of the waves when the lightning was racing
all over the sky, and wave his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) flipper politely to the stumpy-tailed
Albatross and the Man-of-war Hawk as they went down the wind; how to
jump three or four feet clear of the water like a dolphin, flippers
close to the side and tail curved; to leave the flying fish alone
because they are all bony; to take the shoulder-piece out of a cod at
full speed ten fathoms deep, and never to stop and look at a boat or a
ship, but particularly a row-boat. At the end of six months what Kotick
did not know about deep-sea fishing was not worth the knowing. And all
that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawk</b></font>) never set flipper on dry ground.

<p/>One day, however, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawk</b></font>) was lying half asleep in the warm water
somewhere off the Island of Juan Fernandez, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>) felt faint and lazy all
over, just as human people do when the spring is in their legs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>)
remembered the good firm beaches of Novastoshnah seven thousand miles
away, the games his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>) companions played, the smell of the seaweed, the
seal roar, and the fighting. That very minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>) turned north, swimming
steadily, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>) went on he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>) met scores of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>) mates, all bound for
the same place, and they said: <div class="bookquote">``Greeting, Kotick! This year we are
all holluschickie, and we can dance the Fire-dance in the breakers off
Lukannon and play on the new grass. But where did you get that coat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mates</b></font>)</div><p/>Kotick's fur was almost pure white now, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>) felt very proud of
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``Swim quickly! My bones are aching for the land.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
so they all came to the beaches where they had been born, and heard the
old seals, their fathers, fighting in the rolling mist.

<p/>That night Kotick danced the Fire-dance with the yearling seals. The sea
is full of fire on summer nights all the way down from Novastoshnah to
Lukannon, and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>) and a
flaming flash when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>) jumps, and the waves break in great phosphorescent
streaks and swirls. Then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds
and rolled up and down in the new wild wheat and told stories of what
they had done while they had been at sea. They talked about the Pacific
as boys would talk about a wood that they had been nutting in, and if
anyone had understood them he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernandez</b></font>) could have gone away and made such a chart
of that ocean as never was. The three- and four-year-old holluschickie
romped down from Hutchinson's Hill crying: <div class="bookquote">``Out of the way, youngsters!
The sea is deep and you don't know all that's in it yet. Wait till
you've rounded the Horn. Hi, you yearling, where did you get that white
coat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hill</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick. <div class="bookquote">``It grew.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) was going to
roll the speaker over, a couple of black-haired men with flat red faces
came from behind a sand dune, and Kotick, who had never seen a man
before, coughed and lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. The holluschickie just bundled off
a few yards and sat staring stupidly. The men were no less than Kerick
Booterin, the chief of the seal-hunters on the island, and Patalamon,
his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) son. They came from the little village not half a mile from the sea
nurseries, and they were deciding what seals they would drive up to the
killing pens--for the seals were driven just like sheep--to be turned
into seal-skin jackets later on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Patalamon</b></font>)</div>said Patalamon. <div class="bookquote">``Look! There's a white seal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kerick/Kerick Booterin</b></font>)</div><p/>Kerick Booterin turned nearly white under his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) oil and smoke, for he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was
an Aleut, and Aleuts are not clean people. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) began to mutter a
prayer. <div class="bookquote">``Don't touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>), Patalamon. There has never been a white seal
since--since I was born. Perhaps it is old Zaharrof's ghost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) was lost
last year in the big gale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going near him (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Patalamon</b></font>)</div>said Patalamon. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>)'s unlucky. Do you really
think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) is old Zaharrof come back? I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) for some gulls' eggs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Kerick/Kerick Booterin</b></font>)</div>said Kerick. <div class="bookquote">``Head off that drove of
four-year-olds. The men ought to skin two hundred to-day, but it's the
beginning of the season and they are new to the work. A hundred will do.
Quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Patalamon</b></font>)</div><p/>Patalamon rattled a pair of seal's shoulder bones in front of a herd
of holluschickie and they stopped dead, puffing and blowing. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
stepped near and the seals began to move, and Kerick headed them inland,
and they never tried to get back to their companions. Hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven, but they went
on playing just the same. Kotick was the only one who asked questions,
and none of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) companions could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) anything, except that the
men always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every
year.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to follow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) eyes nearly popped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
head as he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) shuffled along in the wake of the herd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The white seal is coming after us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Patalamon</b></font>)</div>cried Patalamon. <div class="bookquote">``That's the first
time a seal has ever come to the killing-grounds alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hsh! Don't look behind you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kerick/Kerick Booterin</b></font>)</div>said Kerick. <div class="bookquote">``It is Zaharrof's ghost! I
must speak to the priest about this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kerick/Kerick Booterin</b></font>)</div><p/>The distance to the killing-grounds was only half a mile, but it took an
hour to cover, because if the seals went too fast Kerick knew that they
would get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they
were skinned. So they went on very slowly, past Sea Lion's Neck, past
Webster House, till they came to the Salt House just beyond the sight
of the seals on the beach. Kotick followed, panting and wondering.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) was at the world's end, but the roar of the seal
nurseries behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel.
Then Kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch
and let the drove cool off for thirty minutes, and Kotick could hear the
fog-dew dripping off the brim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) cap. Then ten or twelve men, each
with an iron-bound club three or four feet long, came up, and Kerick
pointed out one or two of the drove that were bitten by their companions
or too hot, and the men kicked those aside with their heavy boots made
of the skin of a walrus's throat, and then Kerick said, <div class="bookquote">``Let go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kerick/Kerick Booterin</b></font>)</div>and
then the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could.

<p/>Ten minutes later little Kotick did not recognize his (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) friends any more,
for their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers,
whipped off and thrown down on the ground in a pile. That was enough
for Kotick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) turned and galloped -LRB-a seal can gallop very swiftly for
a short time-RRB- back to the sea; his (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) little new mustache bristling with
horror. At Sea Lion's Neck, where the great sea lions sit on the edge
of the surf, he (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) flung himself flipper-overhead into the cool water and
rocked there, gasping miserably. <div class="bookquote">``What's here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a sea lion gruffly,
for as a rule the sea lions keep themselves to themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scoochnie! Ochen scoochnie!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I'm lonesome, very lonesome!'' (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>-RRB- said
Kotick. <div class="bookquote">``They're killing all the holluschickie on all the beaches!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Sea Lion</b></font>)</div><p/>The Sea Lion turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) head inshore. <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Your
friends are making as much noise as ever. You must have seen old Kerick
polishing off a drove. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)'s done that for thirty years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's horrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick, backing water as a wave went over him (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>), and
steadying himself with a screw stroke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) flippers that brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>)
all standing within three inches of a jagged edge of rock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done for a yearling!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Sea Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Sea Lion, who could appreciate good
swimming. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it,
but if you seals will come here year after year, of course the men get
to know of it, and unless you can find an island where no men ever come
you will always be driven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't there any such island?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>began Kotick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've followed the poltoos -LSB-the halibut-RSB- for twenty years, and I can't
say I've found it yet. But look here--you seem to have a fondness for
talking to your betters--suppose you go to Walrus Islet and talk to
Sea Vitch. He (<font color='blue'><b>betters</b></font>) may know something. Don't flounce off like that. It's a
six-mile swim, and if I were you I should haul out and take a nap first,
little one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>Kotick thought that that was good advice, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) swam round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) own
beach, hauled out, and slept for half an hour, twitching all over, as
seals will. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) headed straight for Walrus Islet, a little low sheet
of rocky island almost due northeast from Novastoshnah, all ledges and
rock and gulls' nests, where the walrus herded by themselves.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) landed close to old Sea Vitch--the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled,
fat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners
except when he (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) is asleep--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) was then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) hind flippers half in
and half out of the surf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wake up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>barked Kotick, for the gulls were making a great noise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah! Ho! Hmph! What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sea Vitch</b></font>)</div>said Sea Vitch, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) struck the next
walrus a blow with his (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) tusks and waked him (<font color='blue'><b>Webster</b></font>) up, and the next struck the
next, and so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction
but the right one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi! It's me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick, bobbing in the surf and looking like a
little white slug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! May I be--skinned!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sea Vitch</b></font>)</div>said Sea Vitch, and they all looked at Kotick
as you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a
little boy. Kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just
then; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had seen enough of it. So he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) called out: <div class="bookquote">``Isn't there any place
for seals to go where men don't ever come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and find out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sea Vitch</b></font>)</div>said Sea Vitch, shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Run away. We're
busy here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>Kotick made his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dolphin-jump in the air and shouted as loud as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could:
<div class="bookquote">``Clam-eater! Clam-eater!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew that Sea Vitch never caught a fish in
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life but always rooted for clams and seaweed; though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pretended to
be a very terrible person. Naturally the Chickies and the Gooverooskies
and the Epatkas--the Burgomaster Gulls and the Kittiwakes and the
Puffins, who are always looking for a chance to be rude, took up the
cry, and--so Limmershin told me--for nearly five minutes you could not
have heard a gun fired on Walrus Islet. All the population was yelling
and screaming <div class="bookquote">``Clam-eater! Stareek -LSB-old man-RSB-!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sea Vitch</b></font>)</div>while Sea Vitch rolled
from side to side grunting and coughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now will you tell?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick, all out of breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and ask Sea Cow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sea Vitch</b></font>)</div>said Sea Vitch. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is living still, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be
able to tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How shall I know Sea Cow when I meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick, sheering off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s the only thing in the sea uglier than Sea Vitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burgomaster</b></font>)</div>screamed a
Burgomaster gull, wheeling under Sea Vitch's nose. <div class="bookquote">``Uglier, and with
worse manners! Stareek!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>Kotick swam back to Novastoshnah, leaving the gulls to scream. There he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
found that no one sympathized with him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) little attempt to discover
a quiet place for the seals. They told him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) that men had always driven
the holluschickie--it was part of the day's work--and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) did not
like to see ugly things he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) should not have gone to the killing grounds.
But none of the other seals had seen the killing, and that made the
difference between him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) friends. Besides, Kotick was a white
seal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What you must do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said old Sea Catch, after he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) son's
adventures, <div class="bookquote">``is to grow up and be a big seal like your father, and have
a nursery on the beach, and then they will leave you alone. In another
five years you ought to be able to fight for yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>Even gentle
Matkah, his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mother, said: <div class="bookquote">``You will never be able to stop the killing.
Go and play in the sea, Kotick.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>And Kotick went off and danced the
Fire-dance with a very heavy little heart.

<p/>That autumn he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) left the beach as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could, and set off alone
because of a notion in his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) bullet-head. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was going to find Sea Cow,
if there was such a person in the sea, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was going to find a quiet
island with good firm beaches for seals to live on, where men could not
get at them. So he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) explored and explored by himself from the North to
the South Pacific, swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day
and a night. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) met with more adventures than can be told, and narrowly
escaped being caught by the Basking Shark, and the Spotted Shark, and
the Hammerhead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up
and down the seas, and the heavy polite fish, and the scarlet spotted
scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years, and grow
very proud of it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) never met Sea Cow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) never found an island
that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could fancy.

<p/>If the beach was good and hard, with a slope behind it for seals to play
on, there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon, boiling down
blubber, and Kotick knew what that meant. Or else he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could see that
seals had once visited the island and been killed off, and Kotick knew
that where men had come once they would come again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) picked up with an old stumpy-tailed albatross, who told him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) that
Kerguelen Island was the very place for peace and quiet, and when Kotick
went down there he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was all but smashed to pieces against some wicked
black cliffs in a heavy sleet-storm with lightning and thunder. Yet as
he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) pulled out against the gale he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could see that even there had once
been a seal nursery. And it was so in all the other islands that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
visited.

<p/>Limmershin gave a long list of them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said that Kotick spent five
seasons exploring, with a four months' rest each year at Novastoshnah,
when the holluschickie used to make fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) imaginary
islands. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) went to the Gallapagos, a horrid dry place on the Equator,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was nearly baked to death; he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) went to the Georgia Islands,
the Orkneys, Emerald Island, Little Nightingale Island, Gough's Island,
Bouvet's Island, the Crossets, and even to a little speck of an island
south of the Cape of Good Hope. But everywhere the People of the Sea
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) the same things. Seals had come to those islands once upon a
time, but men had killed them all off. Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) swam thousands of
miles out of the Pacific and got to a place called Cape Corrientes -LRB-that
was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) was coming back from Gough's Island-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) found a few hundred
mangy seals on a rock and they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) that men came there too.

<p/>That nearly broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) headed round the Horn back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>)
own beaches; and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) way north he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) hauled out on an island full of
green trees, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) found an old, old seal who was dying, and Kotick
caught fish for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) sorrows. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick,
<div class="bookquote">``I am going back to Novastoshnah, and if I am driven to the killing-pens
with the holluschickie I shall not care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>The old seal said, <div class="bookquote">``Try once more. I am the last of the Lost Rookery of
Masafuera, and in the days when men killed us by the hundred thousand
there was a story on the beaches that some day a white seal would come
out of the North and lead the seal people to a quiet place. I am old,
and I shall never live to see that day, but others will. Try once more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>And Kotick curled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) mustache -LRB-it was a beauty-RRB- and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am the
only white seal that has ever been born on the beaches, and I am the
only seal, black or white, who ever thought of looking for new islands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>This cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) immensely; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) came back to Novastoshnah that
summer, Matkah, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) mother, begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) to marry and settle down, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) was no longer a holluschick but a full-grown sea-catch, with a curly
white mane on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) shoulders, as heavy, as big, and as fierce as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>)
father. <div class="bookquote">``Give me another season,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Remember, Mother, it is
always the seventh wave that goes farthest up the beach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Curiously enough, there was another seal who thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would put
off marrying till the next year, and Kotick danced the Fire-dance with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) all down Lukannon Beach the night before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) set off on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) last
exploration. This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) went westward, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) had fallen on the
trail of a great shoal of halibut, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) needed at least one hundred
pounds of fish a day to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) in good condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) chased them till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) was tired, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) curled himself up and went to sleep on the
hollows of the ground swell that sets in to Copper Island. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) knew the
coast perfectly well, so about midnight, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) felt himself gently
bumped on a weed-bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Hm, tide's running strong tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
turning over under water opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) eyes slowly and stretched. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) jumped like a cat, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) saw huge things nosing about in the shoal
water and browsing on the heavy fringes of the weeds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the Great Combers of Magellan!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) said, beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Gough</b></font>) mustache. <div class="bookquote">``Who
in the Deep Sea are these people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>They were like no walrus, sea lion, seal, bear, whale, shark, fish,
squid, or scallop that Kotick had ever seen before. They were between
twenty and thirty feet long, and they had no hind flippers, but a
shovel-like tail that looked as if it had been whittled out of wet
leather. Their heads were the most foolish-looking things you ever saw,
and they balanced on the ends of their tails in deep water when they
weren't grazing, bowing solemnly to each other and waving their front
flippers as a fat man waves his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ahem!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick. <div class="bookquote">``Good sport, gentlemen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Frog</b></font>)</div>The big things answered by
bowing and waving their flippers like the Frog Footman. When they began
feeding again Kotick saw that their upper lip was split into two pieces
that they could twitch apart about a foot and bring together again with
a whole bushel of seaweed between the splits. They tucked the stuff into
their mouths and chumped solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Messy style of feeding, that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick. They bowed again, and
Kotick began to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) temper. <div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If you do happen
to have an extra joint in your front flipper you needn't show off so. I
see you bow gracefully, but I should like to know your names.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The split
lips moved and twitched; and the glassy green eyes stared, but they did
not speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick. <div class="bookquote">``You're the only people I've ever met uglier than
Sea Vitch--and with worse manners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) remembered in a flash what the Burgomaster gull had screamed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was a little yearling at Walrus Islet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) tumbled
backward in the water, for he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had found Sea Cow at last.

<p/>The sea cows went on schlooping and grazing and chumping in the weed,
and Kotick asked them questions in every language that he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had picked
up in his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) travels; and the Sea People talk nearly as many languages as
human beings. But the sea cows did not answer because Sea Cow cannot
talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) has only six bones in his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) neck where he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) ought to have seven,
and they say under the sea that that prevents him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) from speaking even
to his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) companions. But, as you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) has an extra joint in his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
foreflipper, and by waving it up and down and about he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) makes what
answers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code.

<p/>By daylight Kotick's mane was standing on end and his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) temper was gone
where the dead crabs go. Then the Sea Cow began to travel northward very
slowly, stopping to hold absurd bowing councils from time to time, and
Kotick followed them, saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``People who are such idiots as
these are would have been killed long ago if they hadn't found out some
safe island. And what is good enough for the Sea Cow is good enough for
the Sea Catch. All the same, I wish they'd hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>It was weary work for Kotick. The herd never went more than forty or
fifty miles a day, and stopped to feed at night, and kept close to the
shore all the time; while Kotick swam round them, and over them, and
under them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) could not hurry them up one-half mile. As they went
farther north they held a bowing council every few hours, and Kotick
nearly bit off his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) mustache with impatience till he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) saw that they were
following up a warm current of water, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) respected them more.

<p/>One night they sank through the shiny water--sank like stones--and for
the first time since he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had known them began to swim quickly. Kotick
followed, and the pace astonished him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) never dreamed that Sea Cow
was anything of a swimmer. They headed for a cliff by the shore--a cliff
that ran down into deep water, and plunged into a dark hole at the
foot of it, twenty fathoms under the sea. It was a long, long swim, and
Kotick badly wanted fresh air before he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was out of the dark tunnel they
led him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) through.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My wig!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) rose, gasping and puffing, into open water at
the farther end. <div class="bookquote">``It was a long dive, but it was worth it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>The sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges of
the finest beaches that Kotick had ever seen. There were long
stretches of smooth-worn rock running for miles, exactly fitted to make
seal-nurseries, and there were play-grounds of hard sand sloping inland
behind them, and there were rollers for seals to dance in, and long
grass to roll in, and sand dunes to climb up and down, and, best of all,
Kotick knew by the feel of the water, which never deceives a true sea
catch, that no men had ever come there.

<p/>The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) did was to assure himself that the fishing was good,
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful low
sandy islands half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog. Away to the
northward, out to sea, ran a line of bars and shoals and rocks that
would never let a ship come within six miles of the beach, and between
the islands and the mainland was a stretch of deep water that ran up to
the perpendicular cliffs, and somewhere below the cliffs was the mouth
of the tunnel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Novastoshnah over again, but ten times better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick. <div class="bookquote">``Sea
Cow must be wiser than I thought. Men can't come down the cliffs, even
if there were any men; and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to
splinters. If any place in the sea is safe, this is it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) began to think of the seal he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) had left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>), but though he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) was
in a hurry to go back to Novastoshnah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) thoroughly explored the new
country, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) would be able to answer all questions.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel, and raced
through to the southward. No one but a sea cow or a seal would have
dreamed of there being such a place, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) looked back at the
cliffs even Kotick could hardly believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) had been under them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) was six days going home, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) was not swimming slowly; and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) hauled out just above Sea Lion's Neck the first person he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) met was the
seal who had been waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) saw by the look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) eyes
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) had found his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) island at last.

<p/>But the holluschickie and Sea Catch, his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) father, and all the other seals
laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) told them what he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) had discovered, and a young
seal about his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) own age said, <div class="bookquote">``This is all very well, Kotick, but you
can't come from no one knows where and order us off like this. Remember
we've been fighting for our nurseries, and that's a thing you never did.
You preferred prowling about in the sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The other seals laughed at this, and the young seal began twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>)
head from side to side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) had just married that year, and was making a
great fuss about it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no nursery to fight for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick. <div class="bookquote">``I only want to show you
all a place where you will be safe. What's the use of fighting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you're trying to back out, of course I've no more to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
the young seal with an ugly chuckle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come with me if I win?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>said Kotick. And a green light came
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) eye, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) was very angry at having to fight at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the young seal carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``If you win, I'll come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) had no time to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) mind, for Kotick's head was out and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>)
teeth sunk in the blubber of the young seal's neck. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) threw
himself back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) haunches and hauled his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) enemy down the beach, shook
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>), and knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) over. Then Kotick roared to the seals: <div class="bookquote">``I've done
my best for you these five seasons past. I've found you the island where
you'll be safe, but unless your heads are dragged off your silly necks
you won't believe. I'm going to teach you now. Look out for yourselves!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>Limmershin told me that never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) life--and Limmershin sees ten
thousand big seals fighting every year--never in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) little life
did he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) see anything like Kotick's charge into the nurseries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) flung
himself at the biggest sea catch he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) could find, caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) by the
throat, choked him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) and bumped him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) and banged him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) grunted for
mercy, and then threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) aside and attacked the next. You see, Kotick
had never fasted for four months as the big seals did every year, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) deep-sea swimming trips kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) in perfect condition, and, best
of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) had never fought before. His (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) curly white mane stood up with
rage, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) eyes flamed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) big dog teeth glistened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) was
splendid to look at. Old Sea Catch, his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) father, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) tearing past,
hauling the grizzled old seals about as though they had been halibut,
and upsetting the young bachelors in all directions; and Sea Catch gave
a roar and shouted: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) may be a fool, but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is the best fighter on the
beaches! Don't tackle your father, my son! He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s with you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bachelors</b></font>)</div><p/>Kotick roared in answer, and old Sea Catch waddled in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) mustache
on end, blowing like a locomotive, while Matkah and the seal that was
going to marry Kotick cowered down and admired their men-folk. It was
a gorgeous fight, for the two fought as long as there was a seal that
dared lift up his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) head, and when there were none they paraded grandly up
and down the beach side by side, bellowing.

<p/>At night, just as the Northern Lights were winking and flashing through
the fog, Kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the scattered
nurseries and the torn and bleeding seals. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I've taught
you your lesson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My wig!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said old Sea Catch, boosting himself up stiffly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) was
fearfully mauled. <div class="bookquote">``The Killer Whale himself could not have cut them up
worse. Son, I'm proud of you, and what's more, I'll come with you to
your island--if there is such a place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear you, fat pigs of the sea. Who comes with me to the Sea Cow's
tunnel? Answer, or I shall teach you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div>roared Kotick.

<p/>There was a murmur like the ripple of the tide all up and down the
beaches. <div class="bookquote">``We will come,''  (<font color='red'><b>thousands</b></font>)</div>said thousands of tired voices. <div class="bookquote">``We will follow
Kotick, the White Seal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kotick</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Kotick dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) head between his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) shoulders and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) eyes
proudly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) was not a white seal any more, but red from head to tail.
All the same he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) would have scorned to look at or touch one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>)
wounds.

<p/>A week later he (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kotick</b></font>) army -LRB-nearly ten thousand holluschickie and old
seals-RRB- went away north to the Sea Cow's tunnel, Kotick leading them,
and the seals that stayed at Novastoshnah called them idiots. But next
spring, when they all met off the fishing banks of the Pacific, Kotick's
seals told such tales of the new beaches beyond Sea Cow's tunnel that
more and more seals left Novastoshnah. Of course it was not all done at
once, for the seals are not very clever, and they need a long time to
turn things over in their minds, but year after year more seals went
away from Novastoshnah, and Lukannon, and the other nurseries, to the
quiet, sheltered beaches where Kotick sits all the summer through,
getting bigger and fatter and stronger each year, while the
holluschickie play around him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), in that sea where no man comes.




<p/>Lukannon

<p/>This is the great deep-sea song that all the St. Paul seals sing when
they are heading back to their beaches in the summer. It is a sort of
very sad seal National Anthem.

<p/>I met my mates in the morning -LRB-and, oh, but I am old!-RRB-
Where roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled;
I heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakers' song--
The Beaches of Lukannon--two million voices strong.

<p/>The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons,
The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes,
The song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame--
The Beaches of Lukannon--before the sealers came!

<p/>I met my mates in the morning -LRB-I'll never meet them more!-RRB-;
They came and went in legions that darkened all the shore.
And o’er the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach
We hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.

<p/>The Beaches of Lukannon--the winter wheat so tall--
The dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!
The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!
The Beaches of Lukannon--the home where we were born!

<p/>I met my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band.
Men shoot us in the water and club us on the land;
Men drive us to the Salt House like silly sheep and tame,
And still we sing Lukannon--before the sealers came.

<p/>Wheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Gooverooska, go!
And tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys the story of our woe;
Ere, empty as the shark's egg the tempest flings ashore,
The Beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!




<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rikki-Tikki-Tavi''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At the hole where he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) went in
Red-Eye called to Wrinkle-Skin.
Hear what little Red-Eye saith:
<div class="bookquote">``Nag, come up and dance with death!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Eye to eye and head to head,
-LRB-Keep the measure, Nag.-RRB-
This shall end when one is dead;
-LRB-At thy pleasure, Nag.-RRB-
Turn for turn and twist for twist--
-LRB-Run and hide thee, Nag.-RRB-
Hah! The hooded Death has missed!
-LRB-Woe betide thee, Nag!-RRB-

<p/>This is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought
single-handed, through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee
cantonment. Darzee, the Tailorbird, helped him (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>), and Chuchundra, the
musk-rat, who never comes out into the middle of the floor, but always
creeps round by the wall, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) advice, but Rikki-tikki did the real
fighting.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) fur and his (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) tail, but
quite like a weasel in his (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) head and his (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) habits. His (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) eyes and the end
of his (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) restless nose were pink. He (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) could scratch himself anywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>)
pleased with any leg, front or back, that he (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) chose to use. He (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) could
fluff up his (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) tail till it looked like a bottle brush, and his (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) war cry as
he (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) scuttled through the long grass was: <div class="bookquote">``Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>One day, a high summer flood washed him (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) out of the burrow where he (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) lived
with his (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) father and mother, and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>), kicking and clucking, down
a roadside ditch. He (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) found a little wisp of grass floating there, and
clung to it till he (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) senses. When he (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) revived, he (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) was lying in
the hot sun on the middle of a garden path, very draggled indeed, and a
small boy was saying, <div class="bookquote">``Here's a dead mongoose. Let's have a funeral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``let's take him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) in and dry him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>). Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) isn't
really dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>They took him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) into the house, and a big man picked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
finger and thumb and said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not dead but half choked. So they
wrapped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in cotton wool, and warmed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over a little fire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes and sneezed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the big man -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an Englishman who had just moved into
the bungalow-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``don't frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>), and we'll see what he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)'ll do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an Englishman</b></font>)</div><p/>It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto of all
the mongoose family is <div class="bookquote">``Run and find out,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mongoose family</b></font>)</div>and Rikki-tikki was a true
mongoose. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at the cotton wool, decided that it was not good to
eat, ran all round the table, sat up and put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fur in order, scratched
himself, and jumped on the small boy's shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be frightened, Teddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``That's his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) way of making
friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ouch! He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)'s tickling under my chin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teddy</b></font>)</div>said Teddy.

<p/>Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy's collar and neck, snuffed at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) ear, and climbed down to the floor, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) sat rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teddy</b></font>)</div>said Teddy's mother, <div class="bookquote">``and that's a wild creature! I
suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)'s so tame because we've been kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Teddy mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All mongooses are like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``If Teddy doesn't pick
him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) up by the tail, or try to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) in a cage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)'ll run in and out of
the house all day long. Let's give him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) something to eat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They gave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a little piece of raw meat. Rikki-tikki liked it
immensely, and when it was finished he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went out into the veranda and sat
in the sunshine and fluffed up his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fur to make it dry to the roots. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are more things to find out about in this house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said to
himself, <div class="bookquote">``than all my family could find out in all their lives. I shall
certainly stay and find out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spent all that day roaming over the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) nearly drowned himself
in the bath-tubs, put his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) nose into the ink on a writing table, and
burned it on the end of the big man's cigar, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) climbed up in the
big man's lap to see how writing was done. At nightfall he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran into
Teddy's nursery to watch how kerosene lamps were lighted, and when Teddy
went to bed Rikki-tikki climbed up too. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) was a restless companion,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) had to get up and attend to every noise all through the
night, and find out what made it. Teddy's mother and father came in,
the last thing, to look at their boy, and Rikki-tikki was awake on
the pillow. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teddy</b></font>)</div>said Teddy's mother. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) may bite the
child.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)'ll do no such thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father. <div class="bookquote">``Teddy's safer with
that little beast than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) had a bloodhound to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>). If a snake
came into the nursery now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Teddy</b></font>)</div><p/>But Teddy's mother wouldn't think of anything so awful.

<p/>Early in the morning Rikki-tikki came to early breakfast in the veranda
riding on Teddy's shoulder, and they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) banana and some boiled
egg. He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) sat on all their laps one after the other, because every
well-brought-up mongoose always hopes to be a house mongoose some day
and have rooms to run about in; and Rikki-tikki's mother -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to
live in the general's house at Segowlee-RRB- had carefully told Rikki what
to do if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) came across white men.

<p/>Then Rikki-tikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen.
It was a large garden, only half cultivated, with bushes, as big as
summer-houses, of Marshal Niel roses, lime and orange trees, clumps of
bamboos, and thickets of high grass. Rikki-tikki licked his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``This
is a splendid hunting-ground,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) tail grew bottle-brushy
at the thought of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) scuttled up and down the garden, snuffing
here and there till he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) heard very sorrowful voices in a thorn-bush.

<p/>It was Darzee, the Tailorbird, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) wife. They had made a beautiful
nest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges
with fibers, and had filled the hollow with cotton and downy fluff. The
nest swayed to and fro, as they sat on the rim and cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Rikki-tikki.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are very miserable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darzee</b></font>)</div>said Darzee. <div class="bookquote">``One of our babies fell out of the
nest yesterday and Nag ate him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rikki-tikki</b></font>)</div>said Rikki-tikki, <div class="bookquote">``that is very sad--but I am a stranger here.
Who is Nag?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rikki-tikki</b></font>)</div><p/>Darzee and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) wife only cowered down in the nest without answering, for
from the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hiss--a
horrid cold sound that made Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet. Then
inch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag,
the big black cobra, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) was five feet long from tongue to tail.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) had lifted one-third of himself clear of the ground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) stayed
balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion tuft balances in the wind,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) looked at Rikki-tikki with the wicked snake's eyes that never
change their expression, whatever the snake may be thinking of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is Nag?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am Nag. The great God Brahm put his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mark upon
all our people, when the first cobra spread his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hood to keep the sun off
Brahm as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) slept. Look, and be afraid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) spread out his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) hood more than ever, and Rikki-tikki saw the
spectacle-mark on the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part
of a hook-and-eye fastening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) was afraid for the minute, but it is
impossible for a mongoose to stay frightened for any length of time, and
though Rikki-tikki had never met a live cobra before, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) mother had fed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) on dead ones, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) knew that all a grown mongoose's business in
life was to fight and eat snakes. Nag knew that too and, at the bottom
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) cold heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) was afraid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rikki-tikki</b></font>)</div>said Rikki-tikki, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) tail began to fluff up again, <div class="bookquote">``marks
or no marks, do you think it is right for you to eat fledglings out of a
nest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rikki-tikki</b></font>)</div><p/>Nag was thinking to himself, and watching the least little movement in
the grass behind Rikki-tikki. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) knew that mongooses in the garden
meant death sooner or later for him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) family, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) wanted to get
Rikki-tikki off his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) guard. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) head a little, and put it
on one side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You eat eggs. Why should not I eat birds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Behind you! Look behind you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Darzee</b></font>)</div>sang Darzee.

<p/>Rikki-tikki knew better than to waste time in staring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) jumped up in
the air as high as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) could go, and just under him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) whizzed by the head
of Nagaina, Nag's wicked wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) had crept up behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) was
talking, to make an end of him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) savage hiss as the stroke
missed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) came down almost across her (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) back, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) had been an old
mongoose he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) would have known that then was the time to break her (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) back
with one bite; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) was afraid of the terrible lashing return stroke
of the cobra. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) bit, indeed, but did not bite long enough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>)
jumped clear of the whisking tail, leaving Nagaina torn and angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wicked, wicked Darzee!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Nag, lashing up as high as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) could reach
toward the nest in the thorn-bush. But Darzee had built it out of reach
of snakes, and it only swayed to and fro.

<p/>Rikki-tikki felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) eyes growing red and hot -LRB-when a mongoose's eyes
grow red, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) is angry-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) sat back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) tail and hind legs like a
little kangaroo, and looked all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>), and chattered with rage. But
Nag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass. When a snake misses its
stroke, it never says anything or gives any sign of what it means to do
next. Rikki-tikki did not care to follow them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) did not feel sure
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) could manage two snakes at once. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) trotted off to the gravel
path near the house, and sat down to think. It was a serious matter for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>).

<p/>If you read the old books of natural history, you will find they say
that when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) runs off and eats some herb that cures him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>). That is not true.
The victory is only a matter of quickness of eye and quickness of
foot--snake's blow against mongoose's jump--and as no eye can follow the
motion of a snake's head when it strikes, this makes things much more
wonderful than any magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) was a young mongoose,
and it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) all the more pleased to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) had managed to
escape a blow from behind. It gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) confidence in himself, and when
Teddy came running down the path, Rikki-tikki was ready to be petted.

<p/>But just as Teddy was stooping, something wriggled a little in the dust,
and a tiny voice said: <div class="bookquote">``Be careful. I am Death!''  (<font color='red'><b>Teddy</b></font>)</div>It was Karait, the
dusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)
bite is as dangerous as the cobra's. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) is so small that nobody
thinks of him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) does the more harm to people.

<p/>Rikki-tikki's eyes grew red again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) danced up to Karait with the
peculiar rocking, swaying motion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) had inherited from his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) family.
It looks very funny, but it is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can
fly off from it at any angle you please, and in dealing with snakes this
is an advantage. If Rikki-tikki had only known, he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) was doing a much more
dangerous thing than fighting Nag, for Karait is so small, and can turn
so quickly, that unless Rikki bit him (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) close to the back of the head,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) would get the return stroke in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) eye or his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) lip. But Rikki did not
know. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) eyes were all red, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) rocked back and forth, looking for
a good place to hold. Karait struck out. Rikki jumped sideways and
tried to run in, but the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within a
fraction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) shoulder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) had to jump over the body, and the head
followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) heels close.

<p/>Teddy shouted to the house: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, look here! Our mongoose is killing a
snake.''  (<font color='red'><b>Teddy</b></font>)</div>And Rikki-tikki heard a scream from Teddy's mother. His (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) father
ran out with a stick, but by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) came up, Karait had lunged out
once too far, and Rikki-tikki had sprung, jumped on the snake's back,
dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) head far between his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) forelegs, bitten as high up the back
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) could get hold, and rolled away. That bite paralyzed Karait, and
Rikki-tikki was just going to eat him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) up from the tail, after the custom
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) family at dinner, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) remembered that a full meal makes a
slow mongoose, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) wanted all his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) strength and quickness ready, he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)
must keep himself thin.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) went away for a dust bath under the castor-oil bushes, while
Teddy's father beat the dead Karait. <div class="bookquote">``What is the use of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>thought
Rikki-tikki. <div class="bookquote">``I have settled it all;''  (<font color='red'><b>Teddy</b></font>)</div>and then Teddy's mother picked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) up from the dust and hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>), crying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) had saved Teddy
from death, and Teddy's father said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) was a providence, and Teddy
looked on with big scared eyes. Rikki-tikki was rather amused at all the
fuss, which, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) did not understand. Teddy's mother might just
as well have petted Teddy for playing in the dust. Rikki was thoroughly
enjoying himself.

<p/>That night at dinner, walking to and fro among the wine-glasses on the
table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) might have stuffed himself three times over with nice things.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) remembered Nag and Nagaina, and though it was very pleasant to be
patted and petted by Teddy's mother, and to sit on Teddy's shoulder, his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)
eyes would get red from time to time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) would go off into his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) long
war cry of <div class="bookquote">``Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Teddy carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) off to bed, and insisted on Rikki-tikki sleeping under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) chin. Rikki-tikki was too well bred to bite or scratch, but as soon
as Teddy was asleep he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) went off for his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) nightly walk round the house,
and in the dark he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) ran up against Chuchundra, the musk-rat, creeping
around by the wall. Chuchundra is a broken-hearted little beast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)
whimpers and cheeps all the night, trying to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) mind to run
into the middle of the room. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) never gets there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't kill me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chuchundra</b></font>)</div>said Chuchundra, almost weeping. <div class="bookquote">``Rikki-tikki, don't
kill me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think a snake-killer kills muskrats?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rikki-tikki</b></font>)</div>said Rikki-tikki
scornfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those who kill snakes get killed by snakes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chuchundra</b></font>)</div>said Chuchundra, more
sorrowfully than ever. <div class="bookquote">``And how am I to be sure that Nag won't mistake
me for you some dark night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not the least danger,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Rikki-tikki. <div class="bookquote">``But Nag is in the
garden, and I know you don't go there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My cousin Chua, the rat, told me--''  (<font color='red'><b>Chuchundra</b></font>)</div>said Chuchundra, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)
stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Told you what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H’sh! Nag is everywhere, Rikki-tikki. You should have talked to Chua in
the garden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't--so you must tell me. Quick, Chuchundra, or I'll bite you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chuchundra</b></font>)</div><p/>Chuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) whiskers.
<div class="bookquote">``I am a very poor man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) sobbed. <div class="bookquote">``I never had spirit enough to run out
into the middle of the room. H’sh! I mustn't tell you anything. Can't
you hear, Rikki-tikki?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Rikki-tikki listened. The house was as still as still, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)
could just catch the faintest scratch-scratch in the world--a noise as
faint as that of a wasp walking on a window-pane--the dry scratch of a
snake's scales on brick-work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Nag or Nagaina,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is crawling into
the bath-room sluice. You're right, Chuchundra; I should have talked to
Chua.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) stole off to Teddy's bath-room, but there was nothing there, and then
to Teddy's mother's bathroom. At the bottom of the smooth plaster wall
there was a brick pulled out to make a sluice for the bath water, and as
Rikki-tikki stole in by the masonry curb where the bath is put, he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) heard
Nag and Nagaina whispering together outside in the moonlight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When the house is emptied of people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nagaina</b></font>)</div>said Nagaina to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Chua</b></font>)
will have to go away, and then the garden will be our own again. Go in
quietly, and remember that the big man who killed Karait is the first
one to bite. Then come out and tell me, and we will hunt for Rikki-tikki
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the
people?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Nag.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything. When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any
mongoose in the garden? So long as the bungalow is empty, we are king
and queen of the garden; and remember that as soon as our eggs in the
melon bed hatch -LRB-as they may tomorrow-RRB-, our children will need room and
quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had not thought of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Nag. <div class="bookquote">``I will go, but there is no need
that we should hunt for Rikki-tikki afterward. I will kill the big man
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, and the child if I can, and come away quietly. Then the
bungalow will be empty, and Rikki-tikki will go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kala Nag/Nag</b></font>)</div><p/>Rikki-tikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this, and then
Nag's head came through the sluice, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) five feet of cold body
followed it. Angry as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was, Rikki-tikki was very frightened as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw
the size of the big cobra. Nag coiled himself up, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head,
and looked into the bathroom in the dark, and Rikki could see his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) eyes
glitter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, if I kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here, Nagaina will know; and if I fight him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on
the open floor, the odds are in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favor. What am I to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Rikki-tikki-tavi.

<p/>Nag waved to and fro, and then Rikki-tikki heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) drinking from the
biggest water-jar that was used to fill the bath. <div class="bookquote">``That is good,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
the snake. <div class="bookquote">``Now, when Karait was killed, the big man had a stick. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may
have that stick still, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes in to bathe in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
will not have a stick. I shall wait here till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes. Nagaina--do you
hear me?--I shall wait here in the cool till daytime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nagaina</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no answer from outside, so Rikki-tikki knew Nagaina had gone
away. Nag coiled himself down, coil by coil, round the bulge at the
bottom of the water jar, and Rikki-tikki stayed still as death. After an
hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) began to move, muscle by muscle, toward the jar. Nag was asleep,
and Rikki-tikki looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) big back, wondering which would be the
best place for a good hold. <div class="bookquote">``If I don't break his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back at the first
jump,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rikki</b></font>)</div>said Rikki, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can still fight. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fights--O Rikki!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rikki</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>)
looked at the thickness of the neck below the hood, but that was too
much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>); and a bite near the tail would only make Nag savage.

<p/>``It must be the head''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) said at last; <div class="bookquote">``the head above the hood. And,
when I am once there, I must not let go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) jumped. The head was lying a little clear of the water jar,
under the curve of it; and, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) teeth met, Rikki braced his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) back
against the bulge of the red earthenware to hold down the head. This
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) just one second's purchase, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) made the most of it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>)
was battered to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dog--to and fro on the
floor, up and down, and around in great circles, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) eyes were red
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) held on as the body cart-whipped over the floor, upsetting the
tin dipper and the soap dish and the flesh brush, and banged against the
tin side of the bath. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) held he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) jaws tighter and tighter,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) made sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) would be banged to death, and, for the honor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>)
family, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) preferred to be found with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) teeth locked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) was dizzy,
aching, and felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a
thunderclap just behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>). A hot wind knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) senseless and red
fire singed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rikki</b></font>) fur. The big man had been wakened by the noise, and had
fired both barrels of a shotgun into Nag just behind the hood.

<p/>Rikki-tikki held on with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes shut, for now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
dead. But the head did not move, and the big man picked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up and said,
<div class="bookquote">``It's the mongoose again, Alice. The little chap has saved our lives
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Teddy's mother came in with a very white face, and saw what was
left of Nag, and Rikki-tikki dragged himself to Teddy's bedroom and
spent half the rest of the night shaking himself tenderly to find out
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) really was broken into forty pieces, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) fancied.

<p/>When morning came he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) was very stiff, but well pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) doings.
<div class="bookquote">``Now I have Nagaina to settle with, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) will be worse than five
Nags, and there's no knowing when the eggs she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke of will hatch.
Goodness! I must go and see Darzee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) said.

<p/>Without waiting for breakfast, Rikki-tikki ran to the thornbush where
Darzee was singing a song of triumph at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) voice. The news
of Nag's death was all over the garden, for the sweeper had thrown the
body on the rubbish-heap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you stupid tuft of feathers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rikki-tikki</b></font>)</div>said Rikki-tikki angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Is this
the time to sing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nag is dead--is dead--is dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Darzee</b></font>)</div>sang Darzee. <div class="bookquote">``The valiant Rikki-tikki
caught him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) by the head and held fast. The big man brought the
bang-stick, and Nag fell in two pieces! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will never eat my babies
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All that's true enough. But where's Nagaina?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rikki-tikki</b></font>)</div>said Rikki-tikki, looking
carefully round him (<font color='blue'><b>sweeper</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nagaina came to the bathroom sluice and called for Nag,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darzee</b></font>)</div>Darzee went
on, <div class="bookquote">``and Nag came out on the end of a stick--the sweeper picked him (<font color='blue'><b>sweeper</b></font>) up
on the end of a stick and threw him (<font color='blue'><b>sweeper</b></font>) upon the rubbish heap. Let us sing
about the great, the red-eyed Rikki-tikki!''  (<font color='red'><b>Darzee</b></font>)</div>And Darzee filled his (<font color='blue'><b>sweeper</b></font>) throat
and sang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could get up to your nest, I'd roll your babies out!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Rikki-tikki. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know when to do the right thing at the right
time. You're safe enough in your nest there, but it's war for me down
here. Stop singing a minute, Darzee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the great, the beautiful Rikki-tikki's sake I will stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darzee</b></font>)</div>said
Darzee. <div class="bookquote">``What is it, O Killer of the terrible Nag?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Nagaina, for the third time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the rubbish heap by the stables, mourning for Nag. Great is
Rikki-tikki with the white teeth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bother my white teeth! Have you ever heard where she (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) eggs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the melon bed, on the end nearest the wall, where the sun strikes
nearly all day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) hid them there weeks ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you never thought it worth while to tell me? The end nearest the
wall, you said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) eggs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not eat exactly; no. Darzee, if you have a grain of sense you will fly
off to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken, and let Nagaina
chase you away to this bush. I must get to the melon-bed, and if I went
there now she (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>)'d see me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darzee</b></font>)</div><p/>Darzee was a feather-brained little fellow who could never hold more
than one idea at a time in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head. And just because he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knew that
Nagaina's children were born in eggs like his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) didn't think at
first that it was fair to kill them. But his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife was a sensible bird,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew that cobra's eggs meant young cobras later on. So she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) flew
off from the nest, and left Darzee to keep the babies warm, and continue
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) song about the death of Nag. Darzee was very like a man in some
ways.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fluttered in front of Nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out,
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, my wing is broken! The boy in the house threw a stone at me and
broke it.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fluttered more desperately than ever.

<p/>Nagaina lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head and hissed, <div class="bookquote">``You warned Rikki-tikki when I
would have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Indeed and truly, you've chosen a bad place to
be lame in.''  (<font color='red'><b>Nagaina</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) moved toward Darzee's wife, slipping along over the
dust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The boy broke it with a stone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Darzee</b></font>)</div>shrieked Darzee's wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! It may be some consolation to you when you're dead to know that I
shall settle accounts with the boy. My husband lies on the rubbish heap
this morning, but before night the boy in the house will lie very still.
What is the use of running away? I am sure to catch you. Little fool,
look at me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darzee</b></font>)</div><p/>Darzee's wife knew better than to do that, for a bird who looks at a
snake's eyes gets so frightened that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cannot move. Darzee's wife
fluttered on, piping sorrowfully, and never leaving the ground, and
Nagaina quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pace.

<p/>Rikki-tikki heard them going up the path from the stables, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) raced
for the end of the melon patch near the wall. There, in the warm litter
above the melons, very cunningly hidden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) found twenty-five eggs,
about the size of a bantam's eggs, but with whitish skin instead of
shell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not a day too soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) said, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) could see the baby cobras
curled up inside the skin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) knew that the minute they were hatched
they could each kill a man or a mongoose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) bit off the tops of the
eggs as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) could, taking care to crush the young cobras, and
turned over the litter from time to time to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) had missed
any. At last there were only three eggs left, and Rikki-tikki began to
chuckle to himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) heard Darzee's wife screaming:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rikki-tikki, I led Nagaina toward the house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has gone into the
veranda, and--oh, come quickly--she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) means killing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darzee wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Rikki-tikki smashed two eggs, and tumbled backward down the melon-bed
with the third egg in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) mouth, and scuttled to the veranda as hard as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darzee</b></font>) could put foot to the ground. Teddy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) mother and father were
there at early breakfast, but Rikki-tikki saw that they were not eating
anything. They sat stone-still, and their faces were white. Nagaina was
coiled up on the matting by Teddy's chair, within easy striking distance
of Teddy's bare leg, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was swaying to and fro, singing a song of
triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Son of the big man that killed Nag,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hissed, <div class="bookquote">``stay still. I am not
ready yet. Wait a little. Keep very still, all you three! If you move I
strike, and if you do not move I strike. Oh, foolish people, who killed
my Nag!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Teddy's eyes were fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) father, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) father could do was
to whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Sit still, Teddy. You mustn't move. Teddy, keep still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Rikki-tikki came up and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Turn round, Nagaina. Turn and
fight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All in good time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), without moving her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I will settle my
account with you presently. Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki. They are
still and white. They are afraid. They dare not move, and if you come a
step nearer I strike.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at your eggs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rikki-tikki</b></font>)</div>said Rikki-tikki, <div class="bookquote">``in the melon bed near the wall.
Go and look, Nagaina!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rikki-tikki</b></font>)</div><p/>The big snake turned half around, and saw the egg on the veranda. <div class="bookquote">``Ah-h!
Give it to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/>Rikki-tikki put his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) paws one on each side of the egg, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) eyes were
blood-red. <div class="bookquote">``What price for a snake's egg? For a young cobra? For a
young king cobra? For the last--the very last of the brood? The ants are
eating all the others down by the melon bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nagaina</b></font>)</div><p/>Nagaina spun clear round, forgetting everything for the sake of the one
egg. Rikki-tikki saw Teddy's father shoot out a big hand, catch Teddy
by the shoulder, and drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) across the little table with the tea-cups,
safe and out of reach of Nagaina.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tricked! Tricked! Tricked! Rikk-tck-tck!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>chuckled Rikki-tikki. <div class="bookquote">``The
boy is safe, and it was I--I--I that caught Nag by the hood last night
in the bathroom.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) began to jump up and down, all four feet
together, his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) head close to the floor. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) threw me to and fro, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
could not shake me off. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was dead before the big man blew him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in two.
I did it! Rikki-tikki-tck-tck! Come then, Nagaina. Come and fight with
me. You shall not be a widow long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nagaina</b></font>)</div><p/>Nagaina saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chance of killing Teddy, and the egg
lay between Rikki-tikki's paws. <div class="bookquote">``Give me the egg, Rikki-tikki. Give me
the last of my eggs, and I will go away and never come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said,
lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you will go away, and you will never come back. For you will go
to the rubbish heap with Nag. Fight, widow! The big man has gone for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
gun! Fight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nagaina</b></font>)</div><p/>Rikki-tikki was bounding all round Nagaina, keeping just out of reach
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stroke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) little eyes like hot coals. Nagaina gathered herself
together and flung out at him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>). Rikki-tikki jumped up and backward. Again
and again and again she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) struck, and each time her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head came with a whack
on the matting of the veranda and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gathered herself together like a
watch spring. Then Rikki-tikki danced in a circle to get behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and
Nagaina spun round to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head to his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) head, so that the rustle of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tail on the matting sounded like dry leaves blown along by the wind.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) had forgotten the egg. It still lay on the veranda, and Nagaina came
nearer and nearer to it, till at last, while Rikki-tikki was drawing
breath, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) caught it in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth, turned to the veranda steps, and
flew like an arrow down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). When
the cobra runs for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) goes like a whip-lash flicked across a
horse's neck.

<p/>Rikki-tikki knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) must catch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), or all the trouble would begin
again. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) headed straight for the long grass by the thorn-bush, and as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) was running Rikki-tikki heard Darzee still singing his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) foolish little
song of triumph. But Darzee's wife was wiser. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) flew off her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nest
as Nagaina came along, and flapped her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wings about Nagaina's head. If
Darzee had helped they might have turned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but Nagaina only lowered
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hood and went on. Still, the instant's delay brought Rikki-tikki up
to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) plunged into the rat-hole where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and Nag used to
live, his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) little white teeth were clenched on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tail, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) went down
with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--and very few mongooses, however wise and old they may be,
care to follow a cobra into its hole. It was dark in the hole; and
Rikki-tikki never knew when it might open out and give Nagaina room to
turn and strike at him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) held on savagely, and stuck out his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) feet to
act as brakes on the dark slope of the hot, moist earth.

<p/>Then the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving, and Darzee said,
<div class="bookquote">``It is all over with Rikki-tikki! We must sing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death song. Valiant
Rikki-tikki is dead! For Nagaina will surely kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) underground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darzee</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) sang a very mournful song that he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) made up on the spur of the
minute, and just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) got to the most touching part, the grass quivered
again, and Rikki-tikki, covered with dirt, dragged himself out of the
hole leg by leg, licking his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) whiskers. Darzee stopped with a little
shout. Rikki-tikki shook some of the dust out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) fur and sneezed.
<div class="bookquote">``It is all over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The widow will never come out again.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And
the red ants that live between the grass stems heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>), and began to
troop down one after another to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) had spoken the truth.

<p/>Rikki-tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) was--slept
and slept till it was late in the afternoon, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) had done a hard
day's work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) awoke, <div class="bookquote">``I will go back to the house. Tell the
Coppersmith, Darzee, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will tell the garden that Nagaina is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The Coppersmith is a bird who makes a noise exactly like the beating of
a little hammer on a copper pot; and the reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) is always making it
is because he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) is the town crier to every Indian garden, and tells all
the news to everybody who cares to listen. As Rikki-tikki went up the
path, he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``attention''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>notes like a tiny dinner gong, and
then the steady <div class="bookquote">``Ding-dong-tock! Nag is dead--dong! Nagaina is dead!
Ding-dong-tock!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That set all the birds in the garden singing, and the
frogs croaking, for Nag and Nagaina used to eat frogs as well as little
birds.

<p/>When Rikki got to the house, Teddy and Teddy's mother -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked very
white still, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been fainting-RRB- and Teddy's father came out and
almost cried over him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>); and that night he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) ate all that was given him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) could eat no more, and went to bed on Teddy's shoulder, where Teddy's
mother saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came to look late at night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saved our lives and Teddy's life,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``Just
think, he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) saved all our lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sleepers</b></font>)</div><p/>Rikki-tikki woke up with a jump, for the mongooses are light sleepers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What are you bothering for? All the cobras are
dead. And if they weren't, I'm here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rikki-tikki</b></font>)</div><p/>Rikki-tikki had a right to be proud of himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not grow too
proud, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it, with tooth
and jump and spring and bite, till never a cobra dared show its head
inside the walls.




<p/>Darzee's Chant

<p/>-LRB-Sung in honor of Rikki-tikki-tavi-RRB-

<p/>Singer and tailor am I--
Doubled the joys that I know--
Proud of my lilt to the sky,
Proud of the house that I sew--
Over and under, so weave I my music--so weave I the house that I
sew.

<p/>Sing to your fledglings again,
Mother, oh lift up your head!
Evil that plagued us is slain,
Death in the garden lies dead.
Terror that hid in the roses is impotent--flung on the dung-hill
and dead!

<p/>Who has delivered us, who?
Tell me his (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) nest and his (<font color='blue'><b>Singer</b></font>) name.
Rikki, the valiant, the true,
Tikki, with eyeballs of flame,
Rikk-tikki-tikki, the ivory-fanged, the hunter with eyeballs of
flame!

<p/>Give him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) the Thanks of the Birds,
Bowing with tail feathers spread!
Praise him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) with nightingale words--
Nay, I will praise him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) instead.
Hear! I will sing you the praise of the bottle-tailed Rikki, with
eyeballs of red!

<p/>-LRB-Here Rikki-tikki interrupted, and the rest of the song is
lost.-RRB-




<p/>Toomai of the Elephants

<p/>I will remember what I was, I am sick of rope and chain--
I will remember my old strength and all my forest affairs.
I will not sell my back to man for a bundle of sugar-cane:
I will go out to my own kind, and the wood-folk in their lairs.

<p/>I will go out until the day, until the morning break--
Out to the wind's untainted kiss, the water's clean caress;
I will forget my ankle-ring and snap my picket stake.
I will revisit my lost loves, and playmates masterless!

<p/>Kala Nag, which means Black Snake, had served the Indian Government in
every way that an elephant could serve it for forty-seven years, and as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) was fully twenty years old when he (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) was caught, that makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) nearly
seventy--a ripe age for an elephant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) remembered pushing, with a big
leather pad on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) forehead, at a gun stuck in deep mud, and that was
before the Afghan War of 1842, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) had not then come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) full
strength.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) mother Radha Pyari,--Radha the darling,--who had been caught in the
same drive with Kala Nag, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>), before his (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) little milk tusks had
dropped out, that elephants who were afraid always got hurt. Kala Nag
knew that that advice was good, for the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) saw a shell
burst he (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) backed, screaming, into a stand of piled rifles, and the
bayonets pricked him (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) softest places. So, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) was
twenty-five, he (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) gave up being afraid, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) was the best-loved
and the best-looked-after elephant in the service of the Government of
India. He (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) had carried tents, twelve hundred pounds' weight of tents, on
the march in Upper India. He (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) had been hoisted into a ship at the end of
a steam crane and taken for days across the water, and made to carry a
mortar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) back in a strange and rocky country very far from India,
and had seen the Emperor Theodore lying dead in Magdala, and had
come back again in the steamer entitled, so the soldiers said, to the
Abyssinian War medal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Theodore</b></font>) fellow elephants die of cold and
epilepsy and starvation and sunstroke up at a place called Ali Musjid,
ten years later; and afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) had been sent down thousands of miles
south to haul and pile big balks of teak in the timberyards at Moulmein.
There he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) had half killed an insubordinate young elephant who was
shirking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) fair share of work.

<p/>After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) was taken off timber-hauling, and employed, with a few
score other elephants who were trained to the business, in helping to
catch wild elephants among the Garo hills. Elephants are very strictly
preserved by the Indian Government. There is one whole department which
does nothing else but hunt them, and catch them, and break them in, and
send them up and down the country as they are needed for work.

<p/>Kala Nag stood ten fair feet at the shoulders, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) tusks had been
cut off short at five feet, and bound round the ends, to prevent them
splitting, with bands of copper; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ali</b></font>) could do more with those stumps
than any untrained elephant could do with the real sharpened ones. When,
after weeks and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across
the hills, the forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into the last
stockade, and the big drop gate, made of tree trunks lashed together,
jarred down behind them, Kala Nag, at the word of command, would go
into that flaring, trumpeting pandemonium -LRB-generally at night, when
the flicker of the torches made it difficult to judge distances-RRB-, and,
picking out the biggest and wildest tusker of the mob, would hammer
him (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) and hustle him (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) into quiet while the men on the backs of the other
elephants roped and tied the smaller ones.

<p/>There was nothing in the way of fighting that Kala Nag, the old wise
Black Snake, did not know, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) had stood up more than once in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>)
time to the charge of the wounded tiger, and, curling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) soft trunk
to be out of harm's way, had knocked the springing brute sideways in
mid-air with a quick sickle cut of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) head, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) had invented all by
himself; had knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) over, and kneeled upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snake</b></font>) huge knees
till the life went out with a gasp and a howl, and there was only a
fluffy striped thing on the ground for Kala Nag to pull by the tail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Big Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Big Toomai, his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) driver, the son of Black Toomai who had
taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) to Abyssinia, and grandson of Toomai of the Elephants who had
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) caught, <div class="bookquote">``there is nothing that the Black Snake fears except me.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) has seen three generations of us feed him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) and groom him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) will
live to see four.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) is afraid of me also,''  (<font color='red'><b>Little Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Little Toomai, standing up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) full
height of four feet, with only one rag upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) was ten years old,
the eldest son of Big Toomai, and, according to custom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) would take
his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) father's place on Kala Nag's neck when he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) grew up, and would handle
the heavy iron ankus, the elephant goad, that had been worn smooth by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) father, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) grandfather, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) great-grandfather.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) was talking of; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) had been born under Kala Nag's
shadow, had played with the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) trunk before he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) could walk, had
taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) down to water as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) could walk, and Kala Nag would no
more have dreamed of disobeying his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) shrill little orders than he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) would
have dreamed of killing him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) on that day when Big Toomai carried the
little brown baby under Kala Nag's tusks, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) to salute his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>)
master that was to be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Little Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Little Toomai, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) is afraid of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Little Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) took long
strides up to Kala Nag, called him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) a fat old pig, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) lift up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) feet one after the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Little Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Little Toomai, <div class="bookquote">``thou art a big elephant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Little Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>)
fluffy head, quoting his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``The Government may pay for elephants,
but they belong to us mahouts. When thou art old, Kala Nag, there will
come some rich rajah, and he (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) will buy thee from the Government, on
account of thy size and thy manners, and then thou wilt have nothing
to do but to carry gold earrings in thy ears, and a gold howdah on thy
back, and a red cloth covered with gold on thy sides, and walk at the
head of the processions of the King. Then I shall sit on thy neck, O
Kala Nag, with a silver ankus, and men will run before us with golden
sticks, crying, `Room for the King's elephant!' That will be good, Kala
Nag, but not so good as this hunting in the jungles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Umph!''  (<font color='red'><b>Big Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Big Toomai. <div class="bookquote">``Thou art a boy, and as wild as a buffalo-calf.
This running up and down among the hills is not the best Government
service. I am getting old, and I do not love wild elephants. Give me
brick elephant lines, one stall to each elephant, and big stumps to tie
them to safely, and flat, broad roads to exercise upon, instead of this
come-and-go camping. Aha, the Cawnpore barracks were good. There was a
bazaar close by, and only three hours' work a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Toomai remembered the Cawnpore elephant-lines and said nothing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) very much preferred the camp life, and hated those broad, flat roads,
with the daily grubbing for grass in the forage reserve, and the long
hours when there was nothing to do except to watch Kala Nag fidgeting in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) pickets.

<p/>What Little Toomai liked was to scramble up bridle paths that only an
elephant could take; the dip into the valley below; the glimpses of the
wild elephants browsing miles away; the rush of the frightened pig and
peacock under Kala Nag's feet; the blinding warm rains, when all the
hills and valleys smoked; the beautiful misty mornings when nobody knew
where they would camp that night; the steady, cautious drive of the wild
elephants, and the mad rush and blaze and hullabaloo of the last night's
drive, when the elephants poured into the stockade like boulders in a
landslide, found that they could not get out, and flung themselves at
the heavy posts only to be driven back by yells and flaring torches and
volleys of blank cartridge.

<p/>Even a little boy could be of use there, and Toomai was as useful as
three boys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) would get his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) torch and wave it, and yell with the
best. But the really good time came when the driving out began, and the
Keddah--that is, the stockade--looked like a picture of the end of the
world, and men had to make signs to one another, because they could not
hear themselves speak. Then Little Toomai would climb up to the top of
one of the quivering stockade posts, his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) sun-bleached brown hair flying
loose all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) shoulders, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) looking like a goblin in the
torch-light. And as soon as there was a lull you could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>)
high-pitched yells of encouragement to Kala Nag, above the trumpeting
and crashing, and snapping of ropes, and groans of the tethered
elephants. <div class="bookquote">``Mael, mael, Kala Nag! -LRB-Go on, go on, Black Snake!-RRB- Dant do!
-LRB-Give him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) the tusk!-RRB- Somalo! Somalo! -LRB-Careful, careful!-RRB- Maro! Mar! -LRB-Hit
him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), hit him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)!-RRB- Mind the post! Arre! Arre! Hai! Yai! Kya-a-ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) would
shout, and the big fight between Kala Nag and the wild elephant would
sway to and fro across the Keddah, and the old elephant catchers would
wipe the sweat out of their eyes, and find time to nod to Little Toomai
wriggling with joy on the top of the posts.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) did more than wriggle. One night he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) slid down from the post and
slipped in between the elephants and threw up the loose end of a rope,
which had dropped, to a driver who was trying to get a purchase on
the leg of a kicking young calf -LRB-calves always give more trouble than
full-grown animals-RRB-. Kala Nag saw him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>), caught him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) trunk, and
handed him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) up to Big Toomai, who slapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) then and there, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>)
back on the post.

<p/>Next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) a scolding and said, <div class="bookquote">``Are not good brick
elephant lines and a little tent carrying enough, that thou must needs
go elephant catching on thy own account, little worthless? Now those
foolish hunters, whose pay is less than my pay, have spoken to Petersen
Sahib of the matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Little Toomai was frightened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) did not know much
of white men, but Petersen Sahib was the greatest white man in the world
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) was the head of all the Keddah operations--the man who caught
all the elephants for the Government of India, and who knew more about
the ways of elephants than any living man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--what will happen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Little Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Little Toomai.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happen! The worst that can happen. Petersen Sahib is a madman. Else why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) go hunting these wild devils? He (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) may even require thee to be
an elephant catcher, to sleep anywhere in these fever-filled jungles,
and at last to be trampled to death in the Keddah. It is well that this
nonsense ends safely. Next week the catching is over, and we of the
plains are sent back to our stations. Then we will march on smooth
roads, and forget all this hunting. But, son, I am angry that thou
shouldst meddle in the business that belongs to these dirty Assamese
jungle folk. Kala Nag will obey none but me, so I must go with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) into
the Keddah, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is only a fighting elephant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) does not help
to rope them. So I sit at my ease, as befits a mahout,--not a mere
hunter,--a mahout, I say, and a man who gets a pension at the end of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) service. Is the family of Toomai of the Elephants to be trodden
underfoot in the dirt of a Keddah? Bad one! Wicked one! Worthless son!
Go and wash Kala Nag and attend to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ears, and see that there are no
thorns in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) feet. Or else Petersen Sahib will surely catch thee and
make thee a wild hunter--a follower of elephant's foot tracks, a jungle
bear. Bah! Shame! Go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Toomai went off without saying a word, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told Kala Nag all
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grievances while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was examining his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``No matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Little Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Little
Toomai, turning up the fringe of Kala Nag's huge right ear. <div class="bookquote">``They
have said my name to Petersen Sahib, and perhaps--and perhaps--and
perhaps--who knows? Hai! That is a big thorn that I have pulled out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a couple</b></font>)</div><p/>The next few days were spent in getting the elephants together, in
walking the newly caught wild elephants up and down between a couple of
tame ones to prevent them giving too much trouble on the downward march
to the plains, and in taking stock of the blankets and ropes and things
that had been worn out or lost in the forest.

<p/>Petersen Sahib came in on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) clever she-elephant Pudmini; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) had been
paying off other camps among the hills, for the season was coming to an
end, and there was a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree, to
pay the drivers their wages. As each man was paid he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
elephant, and joined the line that stood ready to start. The catchers,
and hunters, and beaters, the men of the regular Keddah, who stayed in
the jungle year in and year out, sat on the backs of the elephants that
belonged to Petersen Sahib's permanent force, or leaned against the
trees with their guns across their arms, and made fun of the drivers who
were going away, and laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the
line and ran about.

<p/>Big Toomai went up to the clerk with Little Toomai behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>), and
Machua Appa, the head tracker, said in an undertone to a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Appa</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``There goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least. `Tis a pity to
send that young jungle-cock to molt in the plains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Petersen Sahib had ears all over him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>), as a man must have who listens
to the most silent of all living things--the wild elephant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) turned
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) was lying all along on Pudmini's back and said, <div class="bookquote">``What is that?
I did not know of a man among the plains-drivers who had wit enough to
rope even a dead elephant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pudmini</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is not a man, but a boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went into the Keddah at the last
drive, and threw Barmao there the rope, when we were trying to get that
young calf with the blotch on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder away from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Machua Appa</b></font>)</div><p/>Machua Appa pointed at Little Toomai, and Petersen Sahib looked, and
Little Toomai bowed to the earth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throw a rope? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is smaller than a picket-pin. Little one, what is
thy name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Petersen Sahib/Sahib</b></font>)</div>said Petersen Sahib.

<p/>Little Toomai was too frightened to speak, but Kala Nag was behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>),
and Toomai made a sign with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) hand, and the elephant caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) up in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) trunk and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) level with Pudmini's forehead, in front of the
great Petersen Sahib. Then Little Toomai covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>)
hands, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) was only a child, and except where elephants were
concerned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) was just as bashful as a child could be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Petersen Sahib/Sahib</b></font>)</div>said Petersen Sahib, smiling underneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) mustache, <div class="bookquote">``and why
didst thou teach thy elephant that trick? Was it to help thee steal
green corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to
dry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Petersen Sahib/Sahib</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not green corn, Protector of the Poor,--melons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Little Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Little Toomai,
and all the men sitting about broke into a roar of laughter. Most of
them had taught their elephants that trick when they were boys. Little
Toomai was hanging eight feet up in the air, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) wished very much
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) were eight feet underground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is Toomai, my son, Sahib,''  (<font color='red'><b>Big Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Big Toomai, scowling. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) is a very
bad boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) will end in a jail, Sahib.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of that I have my doubts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Petersen Sahib/Sahib</b></font>)</div>said Petersen Sahib. <div class="bookquote">``A boy who can face a
full Keddah at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) age does not end in jails. See, little one, here are
four annas to spend in sweetmeats because thou hast a little head under
that great thatch of hair. In time thou mayest become a hunter too.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Big
Toomai scowled more than ever. <div class="bookquote">``Remember, though, that Keddahs are not
good for children to play in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Petersen Sahib/Sahib</b></font>)</div>Petersen Sahib went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must I never go there, Sahib?''  (<font color='red'><b>Little Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>asked Little Toomai with a big gasp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Petersen Sahib/Sahib</b></font>)</div>Petersen Sahib smiled again. <div class="bookquote">``When thou hast seen the elephants
dance. That is the proper time. Come to me when thou hast seen the
elephants dance, and then I will let thee go into all the Keddahs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was another roar of laughter, for that is an old joke among
elephant-catchers, and it means just never. There are great cleared flat
places hidden away in the forests that are called elephants' ball-rooms,
but even these are only found by accident, and no man has ever seen the
elephants dance. When a driver boasts of his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) skill and bravery the other
drivers say, <div class="bookquote">``And when didst thou see the elephants dance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the drivers</b></font>)</div><p/>Kala Nag put Little Toomai down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) bowed to the earth again and
went away with his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) father, and gave the silver four-anna piece to his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
mother, who was nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) baby brother, and they all were put up on
Kala Nag's back, and the line of grunting, squealing elephants rolled
down the hill path to the plains. It was a very lively march on account
of the new elephants, who gave trouble at every ford, and needed coaxing
or beating every other minute.

<p/>Big Toomai prodded Kala Nag spitefully, for he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was very angry, but
Little Toomai was too happy to speak. Petersen Sahib had noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>),
and given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) money, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) felt as a private soldier would feel if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>)
had been called out of the ranks and praised by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) commander-in-chief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did Petersen Sahib mean by the elephant dance?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) said, at last,
softly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) mother.

<p/>Big Toomai heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) and grunted. <div class="bookquote">``That thou shouldst never be one of
these hill buffaloes of trackers. That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) meant. Oh, you in
front, what is blocking the way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>An driver elephants</b></font>)</div><p/>An Assamese driver, two or three elephants ahead, turned round angrily,
crying: <div class="bookquote">``Bring up Kala Nag, and knock this youngster of mine into good
behavior. Why should Petersen Sahib have chosen me to go down with you
donkeys of the rice fields? Lay your beast alongside, Toomai, and
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) prod with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) tusks. By all the Gods of the Hills, these new
elephants are possessed, or else they can smell their companions in the
jungle.''  (<font color='red'><b>An driver elephants</b></font>)</div>Kala Nag hit the new elephant in the ribs and knocked the
wind out of him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>), as Big Toomai said, <div class="bookquote">``We have swept the hills of wild
elephants at the last catch. It is only your carelessness in driving.
Must I keep order along the whole line?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Big Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>said the other driver. <div class="bookquote">``We have swept the hills! Ho! Ho! You
are very wise, you plains people. Anyone but a mud-head who never saw
the jungle would know that they know that the drives are ended for the
season. Therefore all the wild elephants to-night will--but why should I
waste wisdom on a river-turtle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will they do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Little Toomai called out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ohe, little one. Art thou there? Well, I will tell thee, for thou hast
a cool head. They will dance, and it behooves thy father, who has
swept all the hills of all the elephants, to double-chain his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pickets
to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What talk is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Big Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Big Toomai. <div class="bookquote">``For forty years, father and son,
we have tended elephants, and we have never heard such moonshine about
dances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but a plainsman who lives in a hut knows only the four walls
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hut. Well, leave thy elephants unshackled tonight and see what
comes. As for their dancing, I have seen the place where--Bapree-bap!
How many windings has the Dihang River? Here is another ford, and we
must swim the calves. Stop still, you behind there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And in this way, talking and wrangling and splashing through the rivers,
they made their first march to a sort of receiving camp for the new
elephants. But they lost their tempers long before they got there.

<p/>Then the elephants were chained by their hind legs to their big stumps
of pickets, and extra ropes were fitted to the new elephants, and the
fodder was piled before them, and the hill drivers went back to Petersen
Sahib through the afternoon light, telling the plains drivers to be
extra careful that night, and laughing when the plains drivers asked the
reason.

<p/>Little Toomai attended to Kala Nag's supper, and as evening fell,
wandered through the camp, unspeakably happy, in search of a tom-tom.
When an Indian child's heart is full, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) does not run about and make a
noise in an irregular fashion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) sits down to a sort of revel all by
himself. And Little Toomai had been spoken to by Petersen Sahib! If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>)
had not found what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) wanted, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) would have been ill. But the
sweetmeat seller in the camp lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) a little tom-tom--a drum beaten
with the flat of the hand--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) sat down, cross-legged, before Kala
Nag as the stars began to come out, the tom-tom in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) lap, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>)
thumped and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) thumped and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) thumped, and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) thought of the
great honor that had been done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>), the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) thumped, all alone
among the elephant fodder. There was no tune and no words, but the
thumping made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) happy.

<p/>The new elephants strained at their ropes, and squealed and trumpeted
from time to time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) mother in the camp hut putting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) small brother to sleep with an old, old song about the great God
Shiv, who once told all the animals what they should eat. It is a very
soothing lullaby, and the first verse says:

<p/>Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,
Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,
Gave to each his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) portion, food and toil and fate,
From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate.
All things made he (<font color='blue'><b>Beggar</b></font>)--Shiva the Preserver.
Mahadeo! Mahadeo! He (<font color='blue'><b>Beggar</b></font>) made all--
Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,
And mother's heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!

<p/>Little Toomai came in with a joyous tunk-a-tunk at the end of each
verse, till he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at Kala
Nag's side. At last the elephants began to lie down one after another
as is their custom, till only Kala Nag at the right of the line was
left standing up; and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rocked slowly from side to side, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ears put
forward to listen to the night wind as it blew very slowly across the
hills. The air was full of all the night noises that, taken together,
make one big silence--the click of one bamboo stem against the other,
the rustle of something alive in the undergrowth, the scratch and squawk
of a half-waked bird -LRB-birds are awake in the night much more often than
we imagine-RRB-, and the fall of water ever so far away. Little Toomai slept
for some time, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) waked it was brilliant moonlight, and Kala
Nag was still standing up with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ears cocked. Little Toomai turned,
rustling in the fodder, and watched the curve of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) big back against
half the stars in heaven, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) watched he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heard, so far away
that it sounded no more than a pinhole of noise pricked through the
stillness, the <div class="bookquote">``hoot-toot''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of a wild elephant.

<p/>All the elephants in the lines jumped up as if they had been shot, and
their grunts at last waked the sleeping mahouts, and they came out and
drove in the picket pegs with big mallets, and tightened this rope and
knotted that till all was quiet. One new elephant had nearly grubbed up
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) picket, and Big Toomai took off Kala Nag's leg chain and shackled
that elephant fore-foot to hind-foot, but slipped a loop of grass string
round Kala Nag's leg, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) to remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) was tied fast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>)
knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) grandfather had done the very same
thing hundreds of times before. Kala Nag did not answer to the order
by gurgling, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) usually did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) stood still, looking out across the
moonlight, his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) head a little raised and his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) ears spread like fans, up to
the great folds of the Garo hills.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tend to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grows restless in the night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Little Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Big Toomai to
Little Toomai, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) went into the hut and slept. Little Toomai was
just going to sleep, too, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) heard the coir string snap with a
little <div class="bookquote">``tang,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and Kala Nag rolled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) pickets as slowly and as
silently as a cloud rolls out of the mouth of a valley. Little Toomai
pattered after him (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>), barefooted, down the road in the moonlight, calling
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Toomai</b></font>) breath, <div class="bookquote">``Kala Nag! Kala Nag! Take me with you, O Kala Nag!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The elephant turned, without a sound, took three strides back to the
boy in the moonlight, put down his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trunk, swung him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neck,
and almost before Little Toomai had settled his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knees, slipped into the
forest.

<p/>There was one blast of furious trumpeting from the lines, and then the
silence shut down on everything, and Kala Nag began to move. Sometimes
a tuft of high grass washed along his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sides as a wave washes along the
sides of a ship, and sometimes a cluster of wild-pepper vines would
scrape along his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back, or a bamboo would creak where his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shoulder
touched it. But between those times he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) moved absolutely without any
sound, drifting through the thick Garo forest as though it had been
smoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was going uphill, but though Little Toomai watched the stars
in the rifts of the trees, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not tell in what direction.

<p/>Then Kala Nag reached the crest of the ascent and stopped for a minute,
and Little Toomai could see the tops of the trees lying all speckled and
furry under the moonlight for miles and miles, and the blue-white mist
over the river in the hollow. Toomai leaned forward and looked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
felt that the forest was awake below him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--awake and alive and crowded.
A big brown fruit-eating bat brushed past his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ear; a porcupine's quills
rattled in the thicket; and in the darkness between the tree stems he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
heard a hog-bear digging hard in the moist warm earth, and snuffing as
it digged.

<p/>Then the branches closed over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head again, and Kala Nag began to go
down into the valley--not quietly this time, but as a runaway gun goes
down a steep bank--in one rush. The huge limbs moved as steadily as
pistons, eight feet to each stride, and the wrinkled skin of the elbow
points rustled. The undergrowth on either side of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ripped with a
noise like torn canvas, and the saplings that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heaved away right and
left with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shoulders sprang back again and banged him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on the flank,
and great trails of creepers, all matted together, hung from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tusks
as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head from side to side and plowed out his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pathway. Then
Little Toomai laid himself down close to the great neck lest a swinging
bough should sweep him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to the ground, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were back in
the lines again.

<p/>The grass began to get squashy, and Kala Nag's feet sucked and squelched
as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) put them down, and the night mist at the bottom of the valley
chilled Little Toomai. There was a splash and a trample, and the rush of
running water, and Kala Nag strode through the bed of a river, feeling
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way at each step. Above the noise of the water, as it swirled round
the elephant's legs, Little Toomai could hear more splashing and some
trumpeting both upstream and down--great grunts and angry snortings, and
all the mist about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed to be full of rolling, wavy shadows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ai!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, half aloud, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) teeth chattering. <div class="bookquote">``The elephant-folk are
out tonight. It is the dance, then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kala Nag/Nag</b></font>)</div><p/>Kala Nag swashed out of the water, blew his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trunk clear, and began
another climb. But this time he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was not alone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not to make
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) path. That was made already, six feet wide, in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), where
the bent jungle-grass was trying to recover itself and stand up. Many
elephants must have gone that way only a few minutes before. Little
Toomai looked back, and behind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a great wild tusker with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little
pig's eyes glowing like hot coals was just lifting himself out of the
misty river. Then the trees closed up again, and they went on and up,
with trumpetings and crashings, and the sound of breaking branches on
every side of them.

<p/>At last Kala Nag stood still between two tree-trunks at the very top
of the hill. They were part of a circle of trees that grew round an
irregular space of some three or four acres, and in all that space, as
Little Toomai could see, the ground had been trampled down as hard as
a brick floor. Some trees grew in the center of the clearing, but their
bark was rubbed away, and the white wood beneath showed all shiny and
polished in the patches of moonlight. There were creepers hanging from
the upper branches, and the bells of the flowers of the creepers, great
waxy white things like convolvuluses, hung down fast asleep. But
within the limits of the clearing there was not a single blade of
green--nothing but the trampled earth.

<p/>The moonlight showed it all iron gray, except where some elephants
stood upon it, and their shadows were inky black. Little Toomai looked,
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) breath, with his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes starting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
looked, more and more and more elephants swung out into the open from
between the tree trunks. Little Toomai could only count up to ten, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) counted again and again on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fingers till he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lost count of the
tens, and his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head began to swim. Outside the clearing he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could hear
them crashing in the undergrowth as they worked their way up the
hillside, but as soon as they were within the circle of the tree trunks
they moved like ghosts.

<p/>There were white-tusked wild males, with fallen leaves and nuts and
twigs lying in the wrinkles of their necks and the folds of their ears;
fat, slow-footed she-elephants, with restless, little pinky black
calves only three or four feet high running under their stomachs; young
elephants with their tusks just beginning to show, and very proud of
them; lanky, scraggy old-maid elephants, with their hollow anxious
faces, and trunks like rough bark; savage old bull elephants, scarred
from shoulder to flank with great weals and cuts of bygone fights,
and the caked dirt of their solitary mud baths dropping from their
shoulders; and there was one with a broken tusk and the marks of the
full-stroke, the terrible drawing scrape, of a tiger's claws on his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
side.

<p/>They were standing head to head, or walking to and fro across the ground
in couples, or rocking and swaying all by themselves--scores and scores
of elephants.

<p/>Toomai knew that so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) lay still on Kala Nag's neck nothing
would happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), for even in the rush and scramble of a Keddah drive
a wild elephant does not reach up with his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) trunk and drag a man off the
neck of a tame elephant. And these elephants were not thinking of men
that night. Once they started and put their ears forward when they heard
the chinking of a leg iron in the forest, but it was Pudmini, Petersen
Sahib's pet elephant, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) chain snapped short off, grunting, snuffling
up the hillside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) must have broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) pickets and come straight from
Petersen Sahib's camp; and Little Toomai saw another elephant, one that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) did not know, with deep rope galls on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) back and breast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>), too,
must have run away from some camp in the hills about.

<p/>At last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest,
and Kala Nag rolled out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) station between the trees and went into
the middle of the crowd, clucking and gurgling, and all the elephants
began to talk in their own tongue, and to move about.

<p/>Still lying down, Little Toomai looked down upon scores and scores of
broad backs, and wagging ears, and tossing trunks, and little rolling
eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) heard the click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by
accident, and the dry rustle of trunks twined together, and the chafing
of enormous sides and shoulders in the crowd, and the incessant flick
and hissh of the great tails. Then a cloud came over the moon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>)
sat in black darkness. But the quiet, steady hustling and pushing and
gurgling went on just the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) knew that there were elephants all
round Kala Nag, and that there was no chance of backing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) out of the
assembly; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) teeth and shivered. In a Keddah at least there
was torchlight and shouting, but here he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) was all alone in the dark, and
once a trunk came up and touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) on the knee.

<p/>Then an elephant trumpeted, and they all took it up for five or ten
terrible seconds. The dew from the trees above spattered down like rain
on the unseen backs, and a dull booming noise began, not very loud at
first, and Little Toomai could not tell what it was. But it grew and
grew, and Kala Nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other, and
brought them down on the ground--one-two, one-two, as steadily as
trip-hammers. The elephants were stamping all together now, and it
sounded like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave. The dew fell from
the trees till there was no more left to fall, and the booming went on,
and the ground rocked and shivered, and Little Toomai put his (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) hands up
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) ears to shut out the sound. But it was all one gigantic jar that
ran through him (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>)--this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth.
Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) could feel Kala Nag and all the others surge forward
a few strides, and the thumping would change to the crushing sound of
juicy green things being bruised, but in a minute or two the boom
of feet on hard earth began again. A tree was creaking and groaning
somewhere near him (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) arm and felt the bark, but Kala Nag
moved forward, still tramping, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) could not tell where he (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) was in the
clearing. There was no sound from the elephants, except once, when two
or three little calves squeaked together. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) heard a thump and a
shuffle, and the booming went on. It must have lasted fully two hours,
and Little Toomai ached in every nerve, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) knew by the smell of the
night air that the dawn was coming.

<p/>The morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills,
and the booming stopped with the first ray, as though the light had
been an order. Before Little Toomai had got the ringing out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) head,
before even he (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) had shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) position, there was not an elephant in
sight except Kala Nag, Pudmini, and the elephant with the rope-galls,
and there was neither sign nor rustle nor whisper down the hillsides to
show where the others had gone.

<p/>Little Toomai stared again and again. The clearing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) remembered it,
had grown in the night. More trees stood in the middle of it, but the
undergrowth and the jungle grass at the sides had been rolled back.
Little Toomai stared once more. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) understood the trampling. The
elephants had stamped out more room--had stamped the thick grass and
juicy cane to trash, the trash into slivers, the slivers into tiny
fibers, and the fibers into hard earth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Little Toomai/Toomai</b></font>)</div>said Little Toomai, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) eyes were very heavy. <div class="bookquote">``Kala Nag, my
lord, let us keep by Pudmini and go to Petersen Sahib's camp, or I shall
drop from thy neck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The third elephant watched the two go away, snorted, wheeled round, and
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) own path. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) may have belonged to some little native king's
establishment, fifty or sixty or a hundred miles away.

<p/>Two hours later, as Petersen Sahib was eating early breakfast, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>)
elephants, who had been double chained that night, began to trumpet, and
Pudmini, mired to the shoulders, with Kala Nag, very footsore, shambled
into the camp. Little Toomai's face was gray and pinched, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>)
hair was full of leaves and drenched with dew, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) tried to salute
Petersen Sahib, and cried faintly: <div class="bookquote">``The dance--the elephant dance! I
have seen it, and--I die!''  (<font color='red'><b>Petersen Sahib/Sahib</b></font>)</div>As Kala Nag sat down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) slid off his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) neck in
a dead faint.

<p/>But, since native children have no nerves worth speaking of, in two
hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) was lying very contentedly in Petersen Sahib's hammock with
Petersen Sahib's shooting-coat under his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) head, and a glass of warm milk,
a little brandy, with a dash of quinine, inside of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>), and while the
old hairy, scarred hunters of the jungles sat three deep before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>),
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) were a spirit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) tale in short
words, as a child will, and wound up with:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, if I lie in one word, send men to see, and they will find that the
elephant folk have trampled down more room in their dance-room, and
they will find ten and ten, and many times ten, tracks leading to that
dance-room. They made more room with their feet. I have seen it. Kala
Nag took me, and I saw. Also Kala Nag is very leg-weary!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Toomai lay back and slept all through the long afternoon and into
the twilight, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) slept Petersen Sahib and Machua Appa followed
the track of the two elephants for fifteen miles across the hills.
Petersen Sahib had spent eighteen years in catching elephants, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>)
had only once before found such a dance-place. Machua Appa had no need
to look twice at the clearing to see what had been done there, or to
scratch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Appa</b></font>) toe in the packed, rammed earth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The child speaks truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Appa</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``All this was done last night, and
I have counted seventy tracks crossing the river. See, Sahib, where
Pudmini's leg-iron cut the bark of that tree! Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Nag</b></font>) was there too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They looked at one another and up and down, and they wondered. For the
ways of elephants are beyond the wit of any man, black or white, to
fathom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forty years and five,''  (<font color='red'><b>Machua Appa</b></font>)</div>said Machua Appa, <div class="bookquote">``have I followed my lord, the
elephant, but never have I heard that any child of man had seen what
this child has seen. By all the Gods of the Hills, it is--what can we
say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Machua Appa</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Appa</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Appa</b></font>) head.

<p/>When they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal. Petersen
Sahib ate alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) tent, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) gave orders that the camp should
have two sheep and some fowls, as well as a double ration of flour and
rice and salt, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) knew that there would be a feast.

<p/>Big Toomai had come up hotfoot from the camp in the plains to search for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) son and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) elephant, and now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) had found them he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) looked at
them as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) were afraid of them both. And there was a feast by
the blazing campfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants,
and Little Toomai was the hero of it all. And the big brown elephant
catchers, the trackers and drivers and ropers, and the men who know all
the secrets of breaking the wildest elephants, passed him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) from one to
the other, and they marked his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) forehead with blood from the breast of a
newly killed jungle-cock, to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was a forester, initiated and
free of all the jungles.

<p/>And at last, when the flames died down, and the red light of the logs
made the elephants look as though they had been dipped in blood too,
Machua Appa, the head of all the drivers of all the Keddahs--Machua
Appa, Petersen Sahib's other self, who had never seen a made road in
forty years: Machua Appa, who was so great that he (<font color='blue'><b>Appa</b></font>) had no other name
than Machua Appa,--leaped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Appa</b></font>) feet, with Little Toomai held high in
the air above his (<font color='blue'><b>Appa</b></font>) head, and shouted: <div class="bookquote">``Listen, my brothers. Listen, too,
you my lords in the lines there, for I, Machua Appa, am speaking! This
little one shall no more be called Little Toomai, but Toomai of the
Elephants, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Appa</b></font>) great-grandfather was called before him (<font color='blue'><b>Appa</b></font>). What never
man has seen he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has seen through the long night, and the favor of the
elephant-folk and of the Gods of the Jungles is with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall
become a great tracker. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall become greater than I, even I, Machua
Appa! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall follow the new trail, and the stale trail, and the mixed
trail, with a clear eye! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall take no harm in the Keddah when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
runs under their bellies to rope the wild tuskers; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slips
before the feet of the charging bull elephant, the bull elephant
shall know who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is and shall not crush him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Aihai! my lords in the
chains,'' (<font color='red'><b>Machua Appa</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Appa</b></font>) whirled up the line of pickets--<div class="bookquote">``here is the little one
that has seen your dances in your hidden places,--the sight that never
man saw! Give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) honor, my lords! Salaam karo, my children. Make your
salute to Toomai of the Elephants! Gunga Pershad, ahaa! Hira Guj, Birchi
Guj, Kuttar Guj, ahaa! Pudmini,--thou hast seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the dance, and
thou too, Kala Nag, my pearl among elephants!--ahaa! Together! To Toomai
of the Elephants. Barrao!''

 (<font color='red'><b>pickets</b></font>)</div><p/>And at that last wild yell the whole line flung up their trunks till the
tips touched their foreheads, and broke out into the full salute--the
crashing trumpet-peal that only the Viceroy of India hears, the Salaamut
of the Keddah.

<p/>But it was all for the sake of Little Toomai, who had seen what never
man had seen before--the dance of the elephants at night and alone in
the heart of the Garo hills!




<p/>Shiv and the Grasshopper

<p/>-LRB-The song that Toomai's mother sang to the baby-RRB-

<p/>Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,
Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,
Gave to each his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiv</b></font>) portion, food and toil and fate,
From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate.
All things made he (<font color='blue'><b>Beggar</b></font>)--Shiva the Preserver.
Mahadeo! Mahadeo! He (<font color='blue'><b>Beggar</b></font>) made all,--
Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,
And mother's heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!


<p/>Wheat he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) gave to rich folk, millet to the poor,
Broken scraps for holy men that beg from door to door;
Battle to the tiger, carrion to the kite,
And rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night.
Naught he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) found too lofty, none he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) saw too low--
Parbati beside him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) watched them come and go;
Thought to cheat her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, turning Shiv to jest--
Stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tricked him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiv</b></font>), Shiva the Preserver.
Mahadeo! Mahadeo! Turn and see.
Tall are the camels, heavy are the kine,
But this was Least of Little Things, O little son of mine!

<p/>When the dole was ended, laughingly she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Master, of a million mouths, is not one unfed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Laughing, Shiv made answer, <div class="bookquote">``All have had their part,
Even he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>), the little one, hidden `neath thy heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Shiv</b></font>)</div>From her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) plucked it, Parbati the thief,
Saw the Least of Little Things gnawed a new-grown leaf!
Saw and feared and wondered, making prayer to Shiv,
Who hath surely given meat to all that live.
All things made he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>)--Shiva the Preserver.
Mahadeo! Mahadeo! He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) made all,--
Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,
And mother's heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!




<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Majesty's Servants

<p/>You can work it out by Fractions or by simple Rule of Three,
But the way of Tweedle-dum is not the way of Tweedle-dee.
You can twist it, you can turn it, you can plait it till you drop,
But the way of Pilly Winky's not the way of Winkie Pop!

<p/>It had been raining heavily for one whole month--raining on a camp
of thirty thousand men and thousands of camels, elephants, horses,
bullocks, and mules all gathered together at a place called Rawal Pindi,
to be reviewed by the Viceroy of India. He (<font color='blue'><b>Viceroy</b></font>) was receiving a visit from
the Amir of Afghanistan--a wild king of a very wild country. The Amir
had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>) for a bodyguard eight hundred men and horses who
had never seen a camp or a locomotive before in their lives--savage
men and savage horses from somewhere at the back of Central Asia. Every
night a mob of these horses would be sure to break their heel ropes and
stampede up and down the camp through the mud in the dark, or the camels
would break loose and run about and fall over the ropes of the tents,
and you can imagine how pleasant that was for men trying to go to sleep.
My tent lay far away from the camel lines, and I thought it was safe.
But one night a man popped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head in and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Get out, quick!
They're coming! My tent's gone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>I knew who <div class="bookquote">``they''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>were, so I put on my boots and waterproof and scuttled
out into the slush. Little Vixen, my fox terrier, went out through the
other side; and then there was a roaring and a grunting and bubbling,
and I saw the tent cave in, as the pole snapped, and begin to dance
about like a mad ghost. A camel had blundered into it, and wet and angry
as I was, I could not help laughing. Then I ran on, because I did not
know how many camels might have got loose, and before long I was out of
sight of the camp, plowing my way through the mud.

<p/>At last I fell over the tail-end of a gun, and by that knew I was
somewhere near the artillery lines where the cannon were stacked at
night. As I did not want to plowter about any more in the drizzle and
the dark, I put my waterproof over the muzzle of one gun, and made a
sort of wigwam with two or three rammers that I found, and lay along the
tail of another gun, wondering where Vixen had got to, and where I might
be.

<p/>Just as I was getting ready to go to sleep I heard a jingle of harness
and a grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wet ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) belonged to
a screw-gun battery, for I could hear the rattle of the straps and rings
and chains and things on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) saddle pad. The screw-guns are tiny little
cannon made in two pieces, that are screwed together when the time comes
to use them. They are taken up mountains, anywhere that a mule can find
a road, and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country.

<p/>Behind the mule there was a camel, with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) big soft feet squelching
and slipping in the mud, and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) neck bobbing to and fro like a
strayed hen's. Luckily, I knew enough of beast language--not wild-beast
language, but camp-beast language, of course--from the natives to know
what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was saying.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must have been the one that flopped into my tent, for he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) called to
the mule, <div class="bookquote">``What shall I do? Where shall I go? I have fought with a white
thing that waved, and it took a stick and hit me on the neck.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-That was
my broken tent pole, and I was very glad to know it.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Shall we run on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it was you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mule, <div class="bookquote">``you and your friends, that have
been disturbing the camp? All right. You'll be beaten for this in the
morning. But I may as well give you something on account now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I heard the harness jingle as the mule backed and caught the camel
two kicks in the ribs that rang like a drum. <div class="bookquote">``Another time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``you'll know better than to run through a mule battery at night,
shouting `Thieves and fire!' Sit down, and keep your silly neck quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The camel doubled up camel-fashion, like a two-foot rule, and sat down
whimpering. There was a regular beat of hoofs in the darkness, and a big
troop-horse cantered up as steadily as though he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were on parade, jumped
a gun tail, and landed close to the mule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's disgraceful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, blowing out his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) nostrils. <div class="bookquote">``Those camels
have racketed through our lines again--the third time this week. How's a
horse to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) condition if he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) isn't allowed to sleep. Who's here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm the breech-piece mule of number two gun of the First Screw
Battery,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mule, <div class="bookquote">``and the other's one of your friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s
waked me up too. Who are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Number Fifteen, E troop, Ninth Lancers--Dick Cunliffe's horse. Stand
over a little, there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mule. <div class="bookquote">``It's too dark to see much. Aren't
these camels too sickening for anything? I walked out of my lines to get
a little peace and quiet here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lords,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the camel humbly, <div class="bookquote">``we dreamed bad dreams in the night,
and we were very much afraid. I am only a baggage camel of the 39th
Native Infantry, and I am not as brave as you are, my lords.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why didn't you stay and carry baggage for the 39th Native
Infantry, instead of running all round the camp?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They were such very bad dreams,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the camel. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry. Listen!
What is that? Shall we run on again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said the mule, <div class="bookquote">``or you'll snap your long stick-legs between
the guns.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cocked one ear and listened. <div class="bookquote">``Bullocks!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Gun
bullocks. On my word, you and your friends have waked the camp very
thoroughly. It takes a good deal of prodding to put up a gun-bullock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I heard a chain dragging along the ground, and a yoke of the great sulky
white bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the elephants won't
go any nearer to the firing, came shouldering along together. And almost
stepping on the chain was another battery mule, calling wildly for
<div class="bookquote">``Billy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's one of our recruits,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the old mule to the troop horse.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>)'s calling for me. Here, youngster, stop squealing. The dark never
hurt anybody yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div><p/>The gun-bullocks lay down together and began chewing the cud, but the
young mule huddled close to Billy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Things!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Fearful and horrible, Billy! They came into our
lines while we were asleep. D’you think they'll kill us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've a very great mind to give you a number-one kicking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy.
<div class="bookquote">``The idea of a fourteen-hand mule with your training disgracing the
battery before this gentleman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gently, gently!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse. <div class="bookquote">``Remember they are always like
this to begin with. The first time I ever saw a man -LRB-it was in Australia
when I was a three-year-old-RRB- I ran for half a day, and if I'd seen a
camel, I should have been running still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the troopers</b></font>)</div><p/>Nearly all our horses for the English cavalry are brought to India from
Australia, and are broken in by the troopers themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy. <div class="bookquote">``Stop shaking, youngster. The first time
they put the full harness with all its chains on my back I stood on
my forelegs and kicked every bit of it off. I hadn't learned the real
science of kicking then, but the battery said they had never seen
anything like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this wasn't harness or anything that jingled,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the young mule.
<div class="bookquote">``You know I don't mind that now, Billy. It was Things like trees, and
they fell up and down the lines and bubbled; and my head-rope broke, and
I couldn't find my driver, and I couldn't find you, Billy, so I ran off
with--with these gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy. <div class="bookquote">``As soon as I heard the camels were loose I came away
on my own account. When a battery--a screw-gun mule calls gun-bullocks
gentlemen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) must be very badly shaken up. Who are you fellows on the
ground there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The gun bullocks rolled their cuds, and answered both together: <div class="bookquote">``The
seventh yoke of the first gun of the Big Gun Battery. We were asleep
when the camels came, but when we were trampled on we got up and walked
away. It is better to lie quiet in the mud than to be disturbed on good
bedding. We told your friend here that there was nothing to be afraid
of, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought otherwise. Wah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went on chewing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That comes of being afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy. <div class="bookquote">``You get laughed at by
gun-bullocks. I hope you like it, young un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The young mule's teeth snapped, and I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) say something about not
being afraid of any beefy old bullock in the world. But the bullocks
only clicked their horns together and went on chewing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't be angry after you've been afraid. That's the worst kind
of cowardice,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse. <div class="bookquote">``Anybody can be forgiven for being
scared in the night, I think, if they see things they don't understand.
We've broken out of our pickets, again and again, four hundred and fifty
of us, just because a new recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at
home in Australia till we were scared to death of the loose ends of our
head-ropes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all very well in camp,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not above stampeding
myself, for the fun of the thing, when I haven't been out for a day or
two. But what do you do on active service?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's quite another set of new shoes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop horse. <div class="bookquote">``Dick
Cunliffe's on my back then, and drives his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunliffe</b></font>) knees into me, and all I have
to do is to watch where I am putting my feet, and to keep my hind legs
well under me, and be bridle-wise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's bridle-wise?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the young mule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the Blue Gums of the Back Blocks,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>snorted the troop-horse, <div class="bookquote">``do you
mean to say that you aren't taught to be bridle-wise in your business?
How can you do anything, unless you can spin round at once when the
rein is pressed on your neck? It means life or death to your man, and of
course that's life and death to you. Get round with your hind legs under
you the instant you feel the rein on your neck. If you haven't room to
swing round, rear up a little and come round on your hind legs. That's
being bridle-wise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We aren't taught that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy the mule stiffly. <div class="bookquote">``We're taught
to obey the man at our head: step off when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says so, and step in when
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says so. I suppose it comes to the same thing. Now, with all this
fine fancy business and rearing, which must be very bad for your hocks,
what do you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse. <div class="bookquote">``Generally I have to go in among a
lot of yelling, hairy men with knives--long shiny knives, worse than
the farrier's knives--and I have to take care that Dick's boot is just
touching the next man's boot without crushing it. I can see Dick's lance
to the right of my right eye, and I know I'm safe. I shouldn't care to
be the man or horse that stood up to Dick and me when we're in a hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't the knives hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the young mule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I got one cut across the chest once, but that wasn't Dick's
fault--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A lot I should have cared whose fault it was, if it hurt!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
young mule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop horse. <div class="bookquote">``If you don't trust your man, you may
as well run away at once. That's what some of our horses do, and I don't
blame them. As I was saying, it wasn't Dick's fault. The man was lying
on the ground, and I stretched myself not to tread on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
slashed up at me. Next time I have to go over a man lying down I shall
step on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy. <div class="bookquote">``It sounds very foolish. Knives are dirty things
at any time. The proper thing to do is to climb up a mountain with a
well-balanced saddle, hang on by all four feet and your ears too, and
creep and crawl and wriggle along, till you come out hundreds of feet
above anyone else on a ledge where there's just room enough for your
hoofs. Then you stand still and keep quiet--never ask a man to hold your
head, young un--keep quiet while the guns are being put together, and
then you watch the little poppy shells drop down into the tree-tops ever
so far below.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you ever trip?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say that when a mule trips you can split a hen's ear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy.
<div class="bookquote">``Now and again perhaps a badly packed saddle will upset a mule, but it's
very seldom. I wish I could show you our business. It's beautiful. Why,
it took me three years to find out what the men were driving at. The
science of the thing is never to show up against the sky line, because,
if you do, you may get fired at. Remember that, young un. Always keep
hidden as much as possible, even if you have to go a mile out of your
way. I lead the battery when it comes to that sort of climbing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fired at without the chance of running into the people who are firing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse, thinking hard. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't stand that. I should
want to charge--with Dick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, you wouldn't. You know that as soon as the guns are in
position they'll do all the charging. That's scientific and neat. But
knives--pah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The baggage-camel had been bobbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) head to and fro for some time
past, anxious to get a word in edgewise. Then I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) say, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>)
cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) throat, nervously:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I--I have fought a little, but not in that climbing way or that
running way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Now you mention it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy, <div class="bookquote">``you don't look as though you were
made for climbing or running--much. Well, how was it, old Hay-bales?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The proper way,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the camel. <div class="bookquote">``We all sat down--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my crupper and breastplate!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse under his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) breath.
<div class="bookquote">``Sat down!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We sat down--a hundred of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the camel went on, <div class="bookquote">``in a big square, and
the men piled our packs and saddles, outside the square, and they fired
over our backs, the men did, on all sides of the square.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of men? Any men that came along?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse. <div class="bookquote">``They
teach us in riding school to lie down and let our masters fire across
us, but Dick Cunliffe is the only man I'd trust to do that. It tickles
my girths, and, besides, I can't see with my head on the ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it matter who fires across you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the camel. <div class="bookquote">``There are
plenty of men and plenty of other camels close by, and a great many
clouds of smoke. I am not frightened then. I sit still and wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy, <div class="bookquote">``you dream bad dreams and upset the camp at
night. Well, well! Before I'd lie down, not to speak of sitting down,
and let a man fire across me, my heels and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head would have something
to say to each other. Did you ever hear anything so awful as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a long silence, and then one of the gun bullocks lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>)
big head and said, <div class="bookquote">``This is very foolish indeed. There is only one way
of fighting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy. <div class="bookquote">``Please don't mind me. I suppose you fellows
fight standing on your tails?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only one way,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the two together. -LRB-They must have been twins.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``This is that way. To put all twenty yoke of us to the big gun as soon
as Two Tails trumpets.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Two Tails''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is camp slang for the elephant.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does Two Tails trumpet for?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the young mule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To show that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is not going any nearer to the smoke on the other
side. Two Tails is a great coward. Then we tug the big gun all
together--Heya--Hullah! Heeyah! Hullah! We do not climb like cats nor
run like calves. We go across the level plain, twenty yoke of us, till
we are unyoked again, and we graze while the big guns talk across the
plain to some town with mud walls, and pieces of the wall fall out, and
the dust goes up as though many cattle were coming home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! And you choose that time for grazing?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the young mule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That time or any other. Eating is always good. We eat till we are yoked
up again and tug the gun back to where Two Tails is waiting for it.
Sometimes there are big guns in the city that speak back, and some of
us are killed, and then there is all the more grazing for those that are
left. This is Fate. None the less, Two Tails is a great coward. That is
the proper way to fight. We are brothers from Hapur. Our father was a
sacred bull of Shiva. We have spoken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've certainly learned something tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you gentlemen of the screw-gun battery feel inclined to eat when you
are being fired at with big guns, and Two Tails is behind you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About as much as we feel inclined to sit down and let men sprawl all
over us, or run into people with knives. I never heard such stuff. A
mountain ledge, a well-balanced load, a driver you can trust to let you
pick your own way, and I'm your mule. But--the other things--no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said
Billy, with a stamp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop horse, <div class="bookquote">``everyone is not made in the same
way, and I can quite see that your family, on your father's side, would
fail to understand a great many things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind my family on my father's side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy angrily, for
every mule hates to be reminded that his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) father was a donkey. <div class="bookquote">``My father
was a Southern gentleman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could pull down and bite and kick into
rags every horse he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came across. Remember that, you big brown Brumby!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Brumby</b></font>)</div><p/>Brumby means wild horse without any breeding. Imagine the feelings of
Sunol if a car-horse called her (<font color='blue'><b>Brumby</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``skate,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and you can imagine how the
Australian horse felt. I saw the white of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brumby</b></font>) eye glitter in the dark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See here, you son of an imported Malaga jackass,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brumby</b></font>) said between
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brumby</b></font>) teeth, <div class="bookquote">``I'd have you know that I'm related on my mother's side to
Carbine, winner of the Melbourne Cup, and where I come from we aren't
accustomed to being ridden over roughshod by any parrot-mouthed,
pig-headed mule in a pop-gun pea-shooter battery. Are you ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On your hind legs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>squealed Billy. They both reared up facing each
other, and I was expecting a furious fight, when a gurgly, rumbly
voice, called out of the darkness to the right--<div class="bookquote">``Children, what are you
fighting about there? Be quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Both beasts dropped down with a snort of disgust, for neither horse nor
mule can bear to listen to an elephant's voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Two Tails!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse. <div class="bookquote">``I can't stand him (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>). A tail at
each end isn't fair!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My feelings exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy, crowding into the troop-horse for
company. <div class="bookquote">``We're very alike in some things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we've inherited them from our mothers,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop horse.
<div class="bookquote">``It's not worth quarreling about. Hi! Two Tails, are you tied up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tails all</b></font>)</div>said Two Tails, with a laugh all up his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) trunk. <div class="bookquote">``I'm picketed for
the night. I've heard what you fellows have been saying. But don't be
afraid. I'm not coming over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The bullocks and the camel said, half aloud, <div class="bookquote">``Afraid of Two Tails--what
nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the bullocks went on, <div class="bookquote">``We are sorry that you heard, but
it is true. Two Tails, why are you afraid of the guns when they fire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tails</b></font>)</div>said Two Tails, rubbing one hind leg against the other, exactly
like a little boy saying a poem, <div class="bookquote">``I don't quite know whether you'd
understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't, but we have to pull the guns,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the bullocks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it, and I know you are a good deal braver than you think
you are. But it's different with me. My battery captain called me a
Pachydermatous Anachronism the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's another way of fighting, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy, who was
recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) spirits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know what that means, of course, but I do. It means betwixt
and between, and that is just where I am. I can see inside my head what
will happen when a shell bursts, and you bullocks can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse. <div class="bookquote">``At least a little bit. I try not to
think about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can see more than you, and I do think about it. I know there's a
great deal of me to take care of, and I know that nobody knows how to
cure me when I'm sick. All they can do is to stop my driver's pay till I
get well, and I can't trust my driver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop horse. <div class="bookquote">``That explains it. I can trust Dick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could put a whole regiment of Dicks on my back without making me
feel any better. I know just enough to be uncomfortable, and not enough
to go on in spite of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We do not understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the bullocks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you don't. I'm not talking to you. You don't know what blood
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We do,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the bullocks. <div class="bookquote">``It is red stuff that soaks into the ground
and smells.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The troop-horse gave a kick and a bound and a snort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I can smell it now, just thinking of it.
It makes me want to run--when I haven't Dick on my back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is not here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the camel and the bullocks. <div class="bookquote">``Why are you so
stupid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's vile stuff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to run, but I don't want to
talk about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tails</b></font>)</div>said Two Tails, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) tail to explain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely. Yes, we have been here all night,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the bullocks.

<p/>Two Tails stamped his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) foot till the iron ring on it jingled. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm
not talking to you. You can't see inside your heads.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. We see out of our four eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the bullocks. <div class="bookquote">``We see straight
in front of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could do that and nothing else, you wouldn't be needed to pull the
big guns at all. If I was like my captain--he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) can see things inside his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
head before the firing begins, and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) shakes all over, but he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) knows too
much to run away--if I was like him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) I could pull the guns. But if I were
as wise as all that I should never be here. I should be a king in the
forest, as I used to be, sleeping half the day and bathing when I liked.
I haven't had a good bath for a month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all very fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy. <div class="bookquote">``But giving a thing a long name
doesn't make it any better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H’sh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop horse. <div class="bookquote">``I think I understand what Two Tails
means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll understand better in a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tails</b></font>)</div>said Two Tails angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Now you
just explain to me why you don't like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) began trumpeting furiously at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) trumpet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy and the troop horse together, and I could
hear them stamp and shiver. An elephant's trumpeting is always nasty,
especially on a dark night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tails</b></font>)</div>said Two Tails. <div class="bookquote">``Won't you explain that, please?
Hhrrmph! Rrrt! Rrrmph! Rrrhha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) stopped suddenly, and I heard
a little whimper in the dark, and knew that Vixen had found me at last.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Vixen</b></font>) knew as well as I did that if there is one thing in the world the
elephant is more afraid of than another it is a little barking dog. So
she (<font color='blue'><b>Vixen</b></font>) stopped to bully Two Tails in his (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) pickets, and yapped round his (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) big
feet. Two Tails shuffled and squeaked. <div class="bookquote">``Go away, little dog!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't snuff at my ankles, or I'll kick at you. Good little dog--nice
little doggie, then! Go home, you yelping little beast! Oh, why doesn't
someone take her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) away? She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'ll bite me in a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seems to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy to the troop horse, <div class="bookquote">``that our friend Two Tails
is afraid of most things. Now, if I had a full meal for every dog I've
kicked across the parade-ground I should be as fat as Two Tails nearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div><p/>I whistled, and Vixen ran up to me, muddy all over, and licked my nose,
and told me a long tale about hunting for me all through the camp. I
never let her (<font color='blue'><b>Vixen</b></font>) know that I understood beast talk, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Vixen</b></font>) would have
taken all sorts of liberties. So I buttoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Vixen</b></font>) into the breast of my
overcoat, and Two Tails shuffled and stamped and growled to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Extraordinary! Most extraordinary!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It runs in our family.
Now, where has that nasty little beast gone to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) feeling about with his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) trunk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We all seem to be affected in various ways,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) went on, blowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>)
nose. <div class="bookquote">``Now, you gentlemen were alarmed, I believe, when I trumpeted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not alarmed, exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse, <div class="bookquote">``but it made me feel as
though I had hornets where my saddle ought to be. Don't begin again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm frightened of a little dog, and the camel here is frightened by bad
dreams in the night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very lucky for us that we haven't all got to fight in the same
way,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I want to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the young mule, who had been quiet for a
long time--<div class="bookquote">``what I want to know is, why we have to fight at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because we're told to,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse, with a snort of contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Orders,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy the mule, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) teeth snapped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hukm hai!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-It is an order!-RRB-, said the camel with a gurgle, and Two
Tails and the bullocks repeated, <div class="bookquote">``Hukm hai!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tails</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but who gives the orders?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the recruit-mule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man who walks at your head--Or sits on your back--Or holds the nose
rope--Or twists your tail,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy and the troop-horse and the camel
and the bullocks one after the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But who gives them the orders?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you want to know too much, young un,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy, <div class="bookquote">``and that is one
way of getting kicked. All you have to do is to obey the man at your
head and ask no questions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tails</b></font>)</div>said Two Tails. <div class="bookquote">``I can't always obey, because I'm
betwixt and between. But Billy's right. Obey the man next to you who
gives the order, or you'll stop all the battery, besides getting a
thrashing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The gun-bullocks got up to go. <div class="bookquote">``Morning is coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they said. <div class="bookquote">``We will
go back to our lines. It is true that we only see out of our eyes, and
we are not very clever. But still, we are the only people to-night who
have not been afraid. Good-night, you brave people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nobody troop-horse</b></font>)</div><p/>Nobody answered, and the troop-horse said, to change the conversation,
<div class="bookquote">``Where's that little dog? A dog means a man somewhere about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nobody troop-horse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>yapped Vixen, <div class="bookquote">``under the gun tail with my man. You big,
blundering beast of a camel you, you upset our tent. My man's very
angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Phew!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the bullocks. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be white!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vixen</b></font>)</div>said Vixen. <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose I'm looked after by a
black bullock-driver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Huah! Ouach! Ugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the bullocks. <div class="bookquote">``Let us get away quickly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They plunged forward in the mud, and managed somehow to run their yoke
on the pole of an ammunition wagon, where it jammed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you have done it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy calmly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't struggle. You're hung
up till daylight. What on earth's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts that Indian cattle
give, and pushed and crowded and slued and stamped and slipped and
nearly fell down in the mud, grunting savagely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll break your necks in a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse. <div class="bookquote">``What's the
matter with white men? I live with `em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They--eat--us! Pull!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the near bullock. The yoke snapped with a
twang, and they lumbered off together.

<p/>I never knew before what made Indian cattle so scared of Englishmen.
We eat beef--a thing that no cattle-driver touches--and of course the
cattle do not like it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I be flogged with my own pad-chains! Who'd have thought of two big
lumps like those losing their heads?''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>said Billy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind. I'm going to look at this man. Most of the white men, I
know, have things in their pockets,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the troop-horse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you, then. I can't say I'm over-fond of `em myself. Besides,
white men who haven't a place to sleep in are more than likely to be
thieves, and I've a good deal of Government property on my back. Come
along, young un, and we'll go back to our lines. Good-night, Australia!
See you on parade to-morrow, I suppose. Good-night, old Hay-bale!--try
to control your feelings, won't you? Good-night, Two Tails! If you pass
us on the ground tomorrow, don't trumpet. It spoils our formation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div><p/>Billy the Mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of an old
campaigner, as the troop-horse's head came nuzzling into my breast, and
I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) biscuits, while Vixen, who is a most conceited little dog,
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) fibs about the scores of horses that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vixen</b></font>) and I kept.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm coming to the parade to-morrow in my dog-cart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vixen</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Where
will you be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the left hand of the second squadron. I set the time for all my
troop, little lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) said politely. <div class="bookquote">``Now I must go back to Dick. My
tail's all muddy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'ll have two hours' hard work dressing me for
parade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>The big parade of all the thirty thousand men was held that afternoon,
and Vixen and I had a good place close to the Viceroy and the Amir of
Afghanistan, with high, big black hat of astrakhan wool and the great
diamond star in the center. The first part of the review was all
sunshine, and the regiments went by in wave upon wave of legs all moving
together, and guns all in a line, till our eyes grew dizzy. Then the
cavalry came up, to the beautiful cavalry canter of <div class="bookquote">``Bonnie Dundee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vixen</b></font>)</div>and
Vixen cocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Vixen</b></font>) ear where she (<font color='blue'><b>Vixen</b></font>) sat on the dog-cart. The second squadron
of the Lancers shot by, and there was the troop-horse, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>) tail
like spun silk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>) head pulled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>) breast, one ear forward and one
back, setting the time for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>) squadron, his (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>) legs going as smoothly
as waltz music. Then the big guns came by, and I saw Two Tails and two
other elephants harnessed in line to a forty-pounder siege gun, while
twenty yoke of oxen walked behind. The seventh pair had a new yoke, and
they looked rather stiff and tired. Last came the screw guns, and Billy
the mule carried himself as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) commanded all the troops, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>)
harness was oiled and polished till it winked. I gave a cheer all by
myself for Billy the mule, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) never looked right or left.

<p/>The rain began to fall again, and for a while it was too misty to see
what the troops were doing. They had made a big half circle across the
plain, and were spreading out into a line. That line grew and grew and
grew till it was three-quarters of a mile long from wing to wing--one
solid wall of men, horses, and guns. Then it came on straight toward the
Viceroy and the Amir, and as it got nearer the ground began to shake,
like the deck of a steamer when the engines are going fast.

<p/>Unless you have been there you cannot imagine what a frightening effect
this steady come-down of troops has on the spectators, even when they
know it is only a review. I looked at the Amir. Up till then he (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>) had not
shown the shadow of a sign of astonishment or anything else. But now his (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>)
eyes began to get bigger and bigger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>) picked up the reins on his (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>)
horse's neck and looked behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>). For a minute it seemed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>)
were going to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>) sword and slash his (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>) way out through the English
men and women in the carriages at the back. Then the advance stopped
dead, the ground stood still, the whole line saluted, and thirty bands
began to play all together. That was the end of the review, and the
regiments went off to their camps in the rain, and an infantry band
struck up with--

<p/>The animals went in two by two,
Hurrah!
The animals went in two by two,
The elephant and the battery mul',
and they all got into the Ark
For to get out of the rain!

<p/>Then I heard an old grizzled, long-haired Central Asian chief, who had
come down with the Amir, asking questions of a native officer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Amir</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``in what manner was this wonderful thing done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And the officer answered, <div class="bookquote">``An order was given, and they obeyed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But are the beasts as wise as the men?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div>said the chief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They obey, as the men do. Mule, horse, elephant, or bullock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
obeys his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) driver, and the driver his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) sergeant, and the sergeant his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
lieutenant, and the lieutenant his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) captain, and the captain his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) major,
and the major his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) colonel, and the colonel his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) brigadier commanding
three regiments, and the brigadier the general, who obeys the Viceroy,
who is the servant of the Empress. Thus it is done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it were so in Afghanistan!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div>said the chief, <div class="bookquote">``for there we obey
only our own wills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for that reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said the native officer, twirling his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) mustache,
<div class="bookquote">``your Amir whom you do not obey must come here and take orders from our
Viceroy.''




 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div><p/>Parade Song of the Camp Animals

<p/>ELEPHANTS OF THE GUN TEAMS

<p/>We lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules,
The wisdom of our foreheads, the cunning of our knees;
We bowed our necks to service: they ne’er were loosed again,--
Make way there--way for the ten-foot teams
Of the Forty-Pounder train!

<p/>GUN BULLOCKS

<p/>Those heroes in their harnesses avoid a cannon-ball,
And what they know of powder upsets them one and all;
Then we come into action and tug the guns again--
Make way there--way for the twenty yoke
Of the Forty-Pounder train!

<p/>CAVALRY HORSES

<p/>By the brand on my shoulder, the finest of tunes
Is played by the Lancers, Hussars, and Dragoons,
And it's sweeter than <div class="bookquote">``Stables''  (<font color='red'><b>Dragoons</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Water''  (<font color='red'><b>Dragoons</b></font>)</div>to me--
The Cavalry Canter of <div class="bookquote">``Bonnie Dundee'' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>!

<p/>Then feed us and break us and handle and groom,
And give us good riders and plenty of room,
And launch us in column of squadron and see
The way of the war-horse to <div class="bookquote">``Bonnie Dundee'' (<font color='red'><b>riders plenty</b></font>)</div>!

<p/>SCREW-GUN MULES

<p/>As me and my companions were scrambling up a hill,
The path was lost in rolling stones, but we went forward still;
For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,
Oh, it's our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to
spare!

<p/>Good luck to every sergeant, then, that lets us pick our road;
Bad luck to all the driver-men that cannot pack a load:
For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,
Oh, it's our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to
spare!

<p/>COMMISSARIAT CAMELS

<p/>We haven't a camelty tune of our own
To help us trollop along,
But every neck is a hair trombone
-LRB-Rtt-ta-ta-ta! is a hair trombone!-RRB-
And this our marching-song:
Can't! Don't! Shan't! Won't!
Pass it along the line!
Somebody's pack has slid from his (<font color='blue'><b>lads</b></font>) back,
Wish it were only mine!
Somebody's load has tipped off in the road--
Cheer for a halt and a row!
Urrr! Yarrh! Grr! Arrh!
Somebody's catching it now!

<p/>ALL THE BEASTS TOGETHER

<p/>Children of the Camp are we,
Serving each in his (<font color='blue'><b>lads</b></font>) degree;
Children of the yoke and goad,
Pack and harness, pad and load.
See our line across the plain,
Like a heel-rope bent again,
Reaching, writhing, rolling far,
Sweeping all away to war!
While the men that walk beside,
Dusty, silent, heavy-eyed,
Cannot tell why we or they
March and suffer day by day.
Children of the Camp are we,
Serving each in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dusty</b></font>) degree;
Children of the yoke and goad,
Pack and harness, pad and load!
