<p/>AUTHOR'S PREFACE

<p/>A small portion of this tale appeared in Once a Week, July-September,
1859, under the title of <div class="bookquote">``A Good Fight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>After writing it, I took wider views of the subject, and also felt
uneasy at having deviated unnecessarily from the historical outline of
a true story. These two sentiments have cost me more than a year's very
hard labour, which I venture to think has not been wasted. After this
plain statement I trust all who comment on this work will see that to
describe it as a reprint would be unfair to the public and to me. The
English language is copious, and, in any true man's hands, quite able
to convey the truth--namely, that one-fifth of the present work is a
reprint, and four-fifths of it a new composition.

<p/>CHARLES READE




<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>Not a day passes over the earth, but men and women of no note do great
deeds, speak great words, and suffer noble sorrows. Of these obscure
heroes, philosophers, and martyrs, the greater part will never be known
till that hour, when many that are great shall be small, and the small
great; but of others the world's knowledge may be said to sleep: their
lives and characters lie hidden from nations in the annals that record
them. The general reader cannot feel them, they are presented so curtly
and coldly: they are not like breathing stories appealing to his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) heart,
but little historic hail-stones striking him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) but to glance off his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
bosom: nor can he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) understand them; for epitomes are not narratives, as
skeletons are not human figures.

<p/>Thus records of prime truths remain a dead letter to plain folk: the
writers have left so much to the imagination, and imagination is so
rare a gift. Here, then, the writer of fiction may be of use to the
public--as an interpreter.

<p/>There is a musty chronicle, written in intolerable Latin, and in it
a chapter where every sentence holds a fact. Here is told, with harsh
brevity, the strange history of a pair, who lived untrumpeted, and died
unsung, four hundred years ago; and lie now, as unpitied, in that stern
page, as fossils in a rock. Thus, living or dead, Fate is still unjust
to them. For if I can but show you what lies below that dry chronicler's
words, methinks you will correct the indifference of centuries, and give
those two sore-tried souls a place in your heart--for a day.

<p/>It was past the middle of the fifteenth century; Louis XI was sovereign
of France; Edward IV was wrongful king of England; and Philip <div class="bookquote">``the
Good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip</b></font>)</div>having by force and cunning dispossessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cousin Jacqueline,
and broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacqueline</b></font>) heart, reigned undisturbed this many years in Holland,
where our tale begins.

<p/>Elias, and Catherine his (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>) wife, lived in the little town of Tergou. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>)
traded, wholesale and retail, in cloth, silk, brown holland, and,
above all, in curried leather, a material highly valued by the middling
people, because it would stand twenty years' wear, and turn an ordinary
knife, no small virtue in a jerkin of that century, in which folk were
so liberal of their steel; even at dinner a man would leave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meat
awhile, and carve you his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour, on a very moderate difference of
opinion.

<p/>The couple were well to do, and would have been free from all earthly
care, but for nine children. When these were coming into the world, one
per annum, each was hailed with rejoicings, and the saints were thanked,
not expostulated with; and when parents and children were all young
together, the latter were looked upon as lovely little playthings
invented by Heaven for the amusement, joy, and evening solace of people
in business.

<p/>But as the olive-branches shot up, and the parents grew older, and saw
with their own eyes the fate of large families, misgivings and care
mingled with their love. They belonged to a singularly wise and
provident people: in Holland reckless parents were as rare as
disobedient children. So now when the huge loaf came in on a gigantic
trencher, looking like a fortress in its moat, and, the tour of the
table once made, seemed to have melted away, Elias and Catherine would
look at one another and say, <div class="bookquote">``Who is to find bread for them all when we
are gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>At this observation the younger ones needed all their filial respect to
keep their little Dutch countenances; for in their opinion dinner and
supper came by nature like sunrise and sunset, and, so long as that
luminary should travel round the earth, so long as the brown loaf go
round their family circle, and set in their stomachs only to rise again
in the family oven. But the remark awakened the national thoughtfulness
of the elder boys, and being often repeated, set several of the family
thinking, some of them good thoughts, some ill thoughts, according to
the nature of the thinkers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kate, the children grow so, this table will soon be too small.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We cannot afford it, Eli,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>replied Catherine, answering not his (<font color='blue'><b>luminary</b></font>) words,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>luminary</b></font>) thought, after the manner of women.

<p/>Their anxiety for the future took at times a less dismal but more
mortifying turn. The free burghers had their pride as well as the
nobles; and these two could not bear that any of their blood should go
down in the burgh after their decease.

<p/>So by prudence and self-denial they managed to clothe all the little
bodies, and feed all the great mouths, and yet put by a small hoard
to meet the future; and, as it grew and grew, they felt a pleasure the
miser hoarding for himself knows not.

<p/>One day the eldest boy but one, aged nineteen, came to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, and,
with that outward composure which has so misled some persons as to the
real nature of this people, begged her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to intercede with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father to
send him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to Amsterdam, and place him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with a merchant. <div class="bookquote">``It is the way
of life that likes me: merchants are wealthy; I am good at numbers;
prithee, good mother, take my part in this, and I shall ever be, as I am
now, your debtor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine threw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands with dismay and incredulity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! leave Tergou!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is one street to me more than another? If I can leave the folk of
Tergou, I can surely leave the stones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! quit your poor father now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is no longer young?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, if I can leave you, I can leave''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! leave your poor brothers and sisters, that love you so dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are enough in the house without me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What mean you, Richart? Who is more thought of than you Stay, have I
spoken sharp to you? Have I been unkind to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never that I know of; and if you had, you should never hear of it from
me. Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richart</b></font>)</div>said Richart gravely, but the tear was in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eye, ``it all
lies in a word, and nothing can change my mind. There will be one mouth
less for you to feed.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There now, see what my tongue has done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, and the next
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began to cry. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first young bird on the edge
of the nest trying his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wings to fly into the world. Richart had a calm,
strong will, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never wasted a word.

<p/>It ended as nature has willed all such discourse shall end: young
Richart went to Amsterdam with a face so long and sad as it had never
been seen before, and a heart like granite.

<p/>That afternoon at supper there was one mouth less. Catherine looked at
Richart's chair and wept bitterly. On this Elias shouted roughly and
angrily to the children, <div class="bookquote">``Sit wider, can't ye: sit wider!''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>and turned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>) head away over the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>) seat awhile, and was silent.

<p/>Richart was launched, and never cost them another penny; but to fit him (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>)
out and place him (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>) in the house of Vander Stegen, the merchant, took all
the little hoard but one gold crown. They began again. Two years passed,
Richart found a niche in commerce for his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) brother Jacob, and Jacob left
Tergou directly after dinner, which was at eleven in the forenoon. At
supper that day Elias remembered what had happened the last time; so it
was in a low whisper he (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Sit wider, dears!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Now until that moment,
Catherine would not see the gap at table, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter Catherine had
besought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) not to grieve to-night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``No, sweetheart,
I promise I will not, since it vexes my children.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But when Elias
whispered <div class="bookquote">``Sit wider!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elias</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Ay! the table will soon be too big
for the children, and you thought it would be too small;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and having
delivered this with forced calmness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) apron the next
moment, and wept sore.

<p/>```Tis the best that leave us,'' sobbed she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``that is the cruel part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay! nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elias</b></font>)</div>said Elias, <div class="bookquote">``our children are good children, and all are
dear to us alike. Heed her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) not! What God takes from us still seems
better that what He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spares to us; that is to say, men are by nature
unthankful--and women silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elias</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I say Richart and Jacob were the flower of the flock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>sobbed
Catherine.

<p/>The little coffer was empty again, and to fill it they gathered
like ants. In those days speculation was pretty much confined to the
card-and-dice business. Elias knew no way to wealth but the slow and
sure one. <div class="bookquote">``A penny saved is a penny gained,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>) humble creed. All
that was not required for the business and the necessaries of life went
into the little coffer with steel bands and florid key. They denied
themselves in turn the humblest luxuries, and then, catching one
another's looks, smiled; perhaps with a greater joy than self-indulgence
has to bestow. And so in three years more they had gleaned enough to set
up their fourth son as a master-tailor, and their eldest daughter as a
robemaker, in Tergou. Here were two more provided for: their own trade
would enable them to throw work into the hands of this pair. But the
coffer was drained to the dregs, and this time the shop too bled a
little in goods if not in coin.

<p/>Alas! there remained on hand two that were unable to get their bread,
and two that were unwilling. The unable ones were, 1, Giles, a dwarf,
of the wrong sort, half stupidity, half malice, all head and claws and
voice, run from by dogs and unprejudiced females, and sided with through
thick and thin by his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) mother; 2, Little Catherine, a poor little girl
that could only move on crutches. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lived in pain, but smiled through
it, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) marble face and violet eyes and long silky lashes; and
fretful or repining word never came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips. The unwilling ones
were Sybrandt, the youngest, a ne’er-do-weel, too much in love with play
to work; and Cornelis, the eldest, who had made calculations, and stuck
to the hearth, waiting for dead men's shoes. Almost worn out by their
repeated efforts, and above all dispirited by the moral and physical
infirmities of those that now remained on hand, the anxious couple would
often say, <div class="bookquote">``What will become of all these when we shall be no longer
here to take care of them?''  (<font color='red'><b>the couple</b></font>)</div>But when they had said this a good many
times, suddenly the domestic horizon cleared, and then they used
still to say it, because a habit is a habit, but they uttered it half
mechanically now, and added brightly and cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``But thanks to St.
Bavon and all the saints, there's Gerard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Young Gerard was for many years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) life a son apart and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was going
into the Church, and the Church could always maintain her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) children by
hook or by crook in those days: no great hopes, because his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) family had
no interest with the great to get him (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) a benefice, and the young man's
own habits were frivolous, and, indeed, such as our cloth merchant
would not have put up with in any one but a clerk that was to be. His (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>)
trivialities were reading and penmanship, and he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) was so wrapped up in
them that often he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) could hardly be got away to his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) meals. The day
was never long enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) carried ever a tinder-box and
brimstone matches, and begged ends of candles of the neighbours, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) lighted at unreasonable hours--ay, even at eight of the clock at
night in winter, when the very burgomaster was abed. Endured at home,
his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) practices were encouraged by the monks of a neighbouring convent.
They had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) penmanship, and continued to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) until one day
they discovered, in the middle of a lesson, that he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) was teaching them.
They pointed this out to him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) in a merry way: he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) hung his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) head and
blushed: he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) had suspected as much himself, but mistrusted his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) judgment
in so delicate a matter. <div class="bookquote">``But, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>an monk</b></font>)</div>said an elderly monk, <div class="bookquote">``how is
it that you, to whom God has given an eye so true, a hand so subtle yet
firm, and a heart to love these beautiful crafts, how is it you do not
colour as well as write? A scroll looks but barren unless a border of
fruit, and leaves, and rich arabesques surround the good words, and
charm the sense as those do the soul and understanding; to say nothing
of the pictures of holy men and women departed, with which the several
chapters should be adorned, and not alone the eye soothed with the brave
and sweetly blended colours, but the heart lifted by effigies of the
saints in glory. Answer me, my son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an monk</b></font>)</div><p/>At this Gerard was confused, and muttered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had made several
trials at illuminating, but had not succeeded well; and thus the matter
rested.

<p/>Soon after this a fellow-enthusiast came on the scene in the unwonted
form of an old lady. Margaret, sister and survivor of the brothers Van
Eyck, left Flanders, and came to end her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) days in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) native country. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
bought a small house near Tergou. In course of time she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) heard of Gerard,
and saw some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) handiwork: it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so well that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
female servant, Reicht Heynes, to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). This led to an
acquaintance: it could hardly be otherwise, for little Tergou had never
held so many as two zealots of this sort before. At first the old lady
damped Gerard's courage terribly. At each visit she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fished out of holes
and corners drawings and paintings, some of them by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own hand, that
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) unapproachable; but if the artist overpowered him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), the
woman kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart up. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Reicht soon turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) inside out like
a glove: among other things, they drew from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) what the good monks had
failed to hit upon, the reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did not illuminate, viz., that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could not afford the gold, the blue, and the red, but only the cheap
earths; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was afraid to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mother to buy the choice
colours, and was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should ask her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in vain. Then Margaret Van Eyck
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a little brush--gold, and some vermilion and ultramarine, and
a piece of good vellum to lay them on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) almost adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) left
the house Reicht ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with a candle and two quarters: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
quite kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>). But better even than the gold and lapis-lazuli to the
illuminator was the sympathy to the isolated enthusiast. That sympathy
was always ready, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) returned it, an affection sprung up between
the old painter and the young caligrapher that was doubly characteristic
of the time. For this was a century in which the fine arts and the
higher mechanical arts were not separated by any distinct boundary, nor
were those who practised them; and it was an age in which artists sought
out and loved one another. Should this last statement stagger a painter
or writer of our day, let me remind him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) that even Christians loved one
another at first starting.

<p/>Backed by an acquaintance so venerable, and strengthened by female
sympathy, Gerard advanced in learning and skill. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) spirits, too, rose
visibly: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) still looked behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) when dragged to dinner in the
middle of an initial G; but once seated, showed great social qualities;
likewise a gay humour, that had hitherto but peeped in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), shone out,
and often he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) set the table in a roar, and kept it there, sometimes with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own wit, sometimes with jests which were glossy new to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) family,
being drawn from antiquity.

<p/>As a return for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) owed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friends the monks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) made them
exquisite copies from two of their choicest MSS., viz., the life of
their founder, and their Comedies of Terence, the monastery finding the
vellum.

<p/>The high and puissant Prince, Philip <div class="bookquote">``the Good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip</b></font>)</div>Duke of Burgundy,
Luxemburg, and Brabant, Earl of Holland and Zealand, Lord of Friesland,
Count of Flanders, Artois, and Hainault, Lord of Salins and Macklyn--was
versatile.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could fight as well as any king going; and lie could lie as well as
any, except the King of France. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was a mighty hunter, and could read
and write. His (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) tastes were wide and ardent. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) loved jewels like a
woman, and gorgeous apparel. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) dearly loved maids of honour, and indeed
paintings generally; in proof of which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) ennobled Jan Van Eyck. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had
also a rage for giants, dwarfs, and Turks. These last stood ever planted
about him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), turbaned and blazing with jewels. His (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) agents inveigled them
from Istamboul with fair promises; but the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had got them, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
baptized them by brute force in a large tub; and this done, let them
squat with their faces towards Mecca, and invoke Mahound as much as they
pleased, laughing in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sleeve at their simplicity in fancying they
were still infidels. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had lions in cages, and fleet leopards trained
by Orientals to run down hares and deer. In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) relished all
rarities, except the humdrum virtues. For anything singularly pretty or
diabolically ugly, this was your customer. The best of him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was
openhanded to the poor; and the next best was, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fostered the arts in
earnest: whereof he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) now gave a signal proof. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) offered prizes for the
best specimens of orfevrerie in two kinds, religious and secular: item,
for the best paintings in white of egg, oils, and tempera; these to
be on panel, silk, or metal, as the artists chose: item, for the best
transparent painting on glass: item, for the best illuminating and
border-painting on vellum: item, for the fairest writing on vellum. The
burgomasters of the several towns were commanded to aid all the poorer
competitors by receiving their specimens and sending them with due care
to Rotterdam at the expense of their several burghs. When this was cried
by the bellman through the streets of Tergou, a thousand mouths opened,
and one heart beat--Gerard's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) family timidly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should try
for two of those prizes. They stared in silence, for their breath was
gone at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) audacity; but one horrid laugh exploded on the floor like
a petard. Gerard looked down, and there was the dwarf, slit and fanged
from ear to ear at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) expense, and laughing like a lion. Nature,
relenting at having made Giles so small, had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) as a set-off the
biggest voice on record. His (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) very whisper was a bassoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was like
those stunted wide-mouthed pieces of ordnance we see on fortifications;
more like a flower-pot than a cannon; but ods tympana how they bellow!

<p/>Gerard turned red with anger, the more so as the others began to titter.
White Catherine saw, and a pink tinge came on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cheek. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said
softly, <div class="bookquote">``Why do you laugh? Is it because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is our brother you think
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cannot be capable? Yes, Gerard, try with the rest. Many say you are
skilful; and mother and I will pray the Virgin to guide your hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, little Kate. You shall pray to our Lady, and our mother
shall buy me vellum and the colours to illuminate with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will they cost, my lad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two gold crowns''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-about three shillings and fourpence English money-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>the housewife</b></font>)</div>screamed the housewife, <div class="bookquote">``when the bushel of rye costs but a
groat! What! me spend a month's meal and meat and fire on such vanity as
that: the lightning from Heaven would fall on me, and my children would
all be beggars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the housewife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>sighed little Catherine, imploringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! it is in vain, Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``I shall have to
give it up, or ask the dame Van Eyck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would give it me, but I think
shame to be for ever taking from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, very sharply; <div class="bookquote">``what has she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to
do coming between me and my son?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) left the room with a red
face. Little Catherine smiled. Presently the housewife returned with a
gracious, affectionate air, and two little gold pieces in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, sweetheart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you won't have to trouble dame or
demoiselle for two paltry crowns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But on this Gerard fell a thinking how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) purse.

<p/>``One will do, mother. I will ask the good monks to let me send my copy
of their `Terence:' it is on snowy vellum, and I can write no better:
so then I shall only need six sheets of vellum for my borders and
miniatures, and gold for my ground, and prime colours--one crown will
do.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never tyne the ship for want of a bit of tar, Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
changeable mother. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Well, there, I will put the crown in
my pocket. That won't be like putting it back in the box. Going to the
box to take out instead of putting in, it is like going to my heart with
a knife for so many drops of blood. You will be sure to want it, Gerard.
The house is never built for less than the builder counted on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sure enough, when the time came, Gerard longed to go to Rotterdam and
see the Duke, and above all to see the work of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) competitors, and
so get a lesson from defeat. And the crown came out of the housewife's
pocket with a very good grace. Gerard would soon be a priest. It seemed
hard if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) might not enjoy the world a little before separating himself
from it for life.

<p/>The night before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went, Margaret Van Eyck asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to take a letter
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>), and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came to look at it, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found it was
addressed to the Princess Marie, at the Stadthouse in Rotterdam.

<p/>The day before the prizes were to be distributed, Gerard started for
Rotterdam in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) holiday suit, to wit, a doublet of silver-grey cloth,
with sleeves, and a jerkin of the same over it, but without sleeves.
From his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) waist to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heels he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was clad in a pair of tight-fitting
buckskin hose fastened by laces -LRB-called points-RRB- to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) doublet. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
shoes were pointed, in moderation, and secured by a strap that passed
under the hollow of the foot. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head and the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) neck he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) flowing hair, and pinned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) back between his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shoulders was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hat: it was further secured by a purple silk ribbon little Kate had
passed round him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) from the sides of the hat, and knotted neatly on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) breast; below his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hat, attached to the upper rim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) broad
waist-belt, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) leathern wallet. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) got within a league of
Rotterdam he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was pretty tired, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) soon fell in with a pair that were
more so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found an old man sitting by the roadside quite worn out, and
a comely young woman holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand, with a face brimful of concern.
The country people trudged by, and noticed nothing amiss; but Gerard, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) passed, drew conclusions. Even dress tells a tale to those who study
it so closely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did, being an illuminator. The old man wore a gown,
and a fur tippet, and a velvet cap, sure signs of dignity; but the
triangular purse at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) girdle was lean, the gown rusty, the fur worn,
sure signs of poverty. The young woman was dressed in plain russet
cloth: yet snow-white lawn covered that part of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck the gown left
visible, and ended half way up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) white throat in a little band of gold
embroidery; and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head-dress was new to Gerard: instead of hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
hair in a pile of linen or lawn, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore an open network of silver cord
with silver spangles at the interstices: in this her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glossy auburn hair
was rolled in front into two solid waves, and supported behind in a
luxurious and shapely mass. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) quick eye took in all this, and the old
man's pallor, and the tears in the young woman's eyes. So when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had
passed them a few yards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reflected, and turned back, and came towards
them bashfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, I fear you are tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, my son, I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the old man, <div class="bookquote">``and faint for lack of
food.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard's address did not appear so agreeable to the girl as to the old
man. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed ashamed, and with much reserve in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) manner, said,
that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fault--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had underrated the distance, and imprudently
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father to start too late in the day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man distance</b></font>)</div>said the old man; <div class="bookquote">``it is not the distance, it is the want of
nourishment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man distance</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck with tender concern, but took that
opportunity of whispering, <div class="bookquote">``Father, a stranger--a young man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was too late. Gerard, with simplicity, and quite as a matter of
course, fell to gathering sticks with great expedition. This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
took down his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wallet, out with the manchet of bread and the iron flask
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) careful mother had put up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) everlasting tinder-box; lighted a
match, then a candle-end, then the sticks; and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) iron flask on it.
Then down he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stomach, and took a good blow: then looking up,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw the girl's face had thawed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was looking down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) energy with a demure smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) laughed back to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mind the pot,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and don't let it spill, for Heaven's sake: there's a cleft
stick to hold it safe with;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and with this he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) set off running towards a
corn-field at some distance.

<p/>Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was gone, there came by, on a mule with rich purple housings,
an old man redolent of wealth. The purse at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) girdle was plethoric,
the fur on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tippet was ermine, broad and new.

<p/>It was Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, the burgomaster of Tergou.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) was old, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) face furrowed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) was a notorious miser, and looked
one generally. But the idea of supping with the Duke raised him (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) just now
into manifest complacency. Yet at the sight of the faded old man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
bright daughter sitting by a fire of sticks, the smile died out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a strange look of pain and uneasiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reined in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Peter,--Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), almost fiercely, <div class="bookquote">``what mummery is
this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Peter was going to answer, but Margaret interposed hastily, and
said: <div class="bookquote">``My father was exhausted, so I am warming something to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
strength before we go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! reduced to feed by the roadside like the Bohemians,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>said
Ghysbrecht, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) hand went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) purse; but it did not seem at
home there; it fumbled uncertainly, afraid too large a coin might stick
to a finger and come out.

<p/>At this moment who should come bounding up but Gerard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had two straws
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) threw himself down by the fire and relieved Margaret
of the cooking part: then suddenly recognizing the burgomaster, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
coloured all over. Ghysbrecht Van Swieten started and glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>),
and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) hand out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) purse. <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``I am
not wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and went slowly on, casting a long look of suspicion on
Margaret, and hostility on Gerard, that was not very intelligible.
However, there was something about it that Margaret could read enough
to blush at, and almost toss her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head. Gerard only stared with surprise.
<div class="bookquote">``By St. Bavon, I think the old miser grudges us three our quart
of soup,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). When the young man put that interpretation on
Ghysbrecht's strange and meaning look, Margaret was greatly relieved,
and smiled gaily on the speaker.

<p/>Meanwhile Ghysbrecht plodded on, more wretched in his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) wealth than these
in their poverty. And the curious thing is, that the mule, the purple
housings, and one-half the coin in that plethoric purse, belonged not to
Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, but to that faded old man and that comely girl,
who sat by a roadside fire to be fed by a stranger. They did not know
this; but Ghysbrecht knew it, and carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) heart a scorpion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) own begetting; that scorpion is remorse--the remorse that, not
being penitence, is incurable, and ready for fresh misdeeds upon a fresh
temptation.

<p/>Twenty years ago, when Ghysbrecht Van Swieten was a hard and honest man,
the touchstone opportunity came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) did an act of heartless
roguery. It seemed a safe one. It had hitherto proved a safe one, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) had never felt safe. To-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) had seen youth, enterprise, and, above
all, knowledge, seated by fair Margaret and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father on terms that
look familiar and loving.

<p/>And the fiends are at big ear again.



<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The soup is hot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how are we to get it to our mouths?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired the senior,
despondingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, the young man has brought us straws.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>And Margaret smiled
slily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man; <div class="bookquote">``but my poor bones are stiff, and indeed the
fire is too hot for a body to kneel over with these short straws. St.
John the Baptist, but the young man is adroit!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>For, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) difficulty, Gerard removed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) untied in a
moment the knot on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) breast, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hat off, put a stone into each
corner of it, then, wrapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand in the tail of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) jerkin, whipped
the flask off the fire, wedged it in between the stones, and put the
hat under the old man's nose with a merry smile. The other tremulously
inserted the pipe of rye-straw and sucked. Lo and behold, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wan, drawn
face was seen to light up more and more, till it quite glowed; and as
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had drawn a long breath:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hippocrates and Galen!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, ```tis a soupe au vin--the restorative
of restoratives. Blessed be the nation that invented it, and the woman
that made it, and the young man who brings it to fainting folk. Have a
suck, my girl, while I relate to our young host the history and virtues
of this his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sovereign compound. This corroborative, young sir, was
unknown to the ancients: we find it neither in their treatises of
medicine, nor in those popular narratives, which reveal many of their
remedies, both in chirurgery and medicine proper. Hector, in the Ilias,
if my memory does not play me false--

<p/>-LRB-Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Alas! he (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>)'s off.'' (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/>--was invited by one of the ladies of the poem to drink a draught of
wine; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) declined, on the plea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) was just going into battle,
and must not take aught to weaken his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) powers. Now, if the soupe au vin
had been known in Troy, it is clear that in declining vinum merum upon
that score, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) would have added in the hexameter, `But a soupe au vin,
madam, I will degust, and gratefully.' Not only would this have been but
common civility--a virtue no perfect commander is wanting in--but not
to have done it would have proved him (<font color='blue'><b>commander</b></font>) a shallow and improvident person,
unfit to be trusted with the conduct of a war; for men going into a
battle need sustenance and all possible support, as is proved by this,
that foolish generals, bringing hungry soldiers to blows with full ones,
have been defeated, in all ages, by inferior numbers. The Romans lost
a great battle in the north of Italy to Hannibal, the Carthaginian, by
this neglect alone. Now, this divine elixir gives in one moment force to
the limbs and ardour to the spirits; and taken into Hector's body at
the nick of time, would, by the aid of Phoebus, Venus, and the blessed
saints, have most likely procured the Greeks a defeat. For note how
faint and weary and heart-sick I was a minute ago; well, I suck this
celestial cordial, and now behold me brave as Achilles and strong as an
eagle.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father, now? an eagle, alack!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Girl, I defy thee and all the world. Ready, I say, like a foaming
charger, to devour the space between this and Rotterdam, and strong
to combat the ills of life, even poverty and old age, which last
philosophers have called the summum malum. Negatur; unless the man's
life has been ill-spent--which, by the bye, it generally has. Now for
the moderns!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father! dear father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fear me not, girl; I will be brief, unreasonably and unseasonably
brief. The soupe au vin occurs not in modern science; but this is only
one proof more, if proof were needed, that for the last few hundred
years physicians have been idiots, with their chicken-broth and their
decoction of gold, whereby they attribute the highest qualities to that
meat which has the least juice of any meat, and to that metal which
has less chemical qualities than all the metals; mountebanks! dunces!
homicides! Since, then, from these no light is to be gathered, go we
to the chroniclers; and first we find that Duguesclin, a French knight,
being about to join battle with the English--masters, at that time, of
half France, and sturdy strikers by sea and land--drank, not one, but
three soupes au vin in honour of the Blessed Trinity. This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)
charged the islanders; and, as might have been foretold, killed a
multitude, and drove the rest into the sea. But he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was only the first
of a long list of holy and hard-hitting ones who have, by this divine
restorative, been sustentated, fortified, corroborated, and consoled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear father, prithee add thyself to that venerable company ere the
soup cools.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>And Margaret held the hat imploringly in both hands till he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>)
inserted the straw once more.

<p/>This spared them the <div class="bookquote">``modern instances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>and gave Gerard an opportunity
of telling Margaret how proud his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mother would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) soup had profited
a man of learning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! but,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``it would like her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ill to see her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) son give all
and take none himself. Why brought you but two straws?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fair mistress, I hoped you would let me put my lips to your straw,
there being but two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret smiled and blushed. <div class="bookquote">``Never beg that you may command,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``The straw is not mine, `tis yours: you cut it in yonder field.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cut it, and that made it mine; but after that, your lip touched it,
and that made it yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did it Then I will lend it you. There--now it is yours again; your lip
has touched it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it belongs to us both now. Let us divide it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means; you have a knife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, I will not cut it--that would be unlucky. I'll bite it. There I
shall keep my half: you will burn yours, once you get home, I doubt.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know me not. I waste nothing. It is odds but I make a hairpin of
it, or something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the novice Gerard</b></font>)</div><p/>This answer dashed the novice Gerard, instead of provoking him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), to fresh
efforts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was silent. And now, the bread and soup being disposed
of, the old scholar prepared to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) journey. Then came a
little difficulty: Gerard the adroit could not tie his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ribbon again as
Catherine had tied it. Margaret, after slily eyeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) efforts for
some time, offered to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); for at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) age girls love to be coy and
tender, saucy and gentle, by turns, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had put him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) out of
countenance but now. Then a fair head, with its stately crown of auburn
hair, glossy and glowing through silver, bowed sweetly towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); and,
while it ravished his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eye, two white supple hands played delicately upon
the stubborn ribbon, and moulded it with soft and airy touches. Then a
heavenly thrill ran through the innocent young man, and vague glimpses
of a new world of feeling and sentiment opened on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And these new and
exquisite sensations Margaret unwittingly prolonged: it is not natural
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sex to hurry aught that pertains to the sacred toilet. Nay, when
the taper fingers had at last subjugated the ends of the knot, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind
was not quite easy, till, by a manoeuvre peculiar to the female hand,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) palm convex, and so applied it with a gentle pressure
to the centre of the knot--a sweet little coaxing hand-kiss, as much as
to say, <div class="bookquote">``Now be a good knot, and stay so.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The palm-kiss was bestowed on
the ribbon, but the wearer's heart leaped to meet it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, that is how it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, and drew back to take one
last keen survey of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) work; then, looking up for simple approval
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) skill, received full in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes a longing gaze of such ardent
adoration, as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lower them quickly and colour all over. An
indescribable tremor seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) retreated with downcast lashes
and tell-tale cheeks, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father's arm on the opposite side.
Gerard, blushing at having scared her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes, took the
other arm; and so the two young things went downcast and conscious, and
propped the eagle along in silence.

<p/>They entered Rotterdam by the Schiedamze Poort; and, as Gerard was
unacquainted with the town, Peter directed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) the way to the Hooch
Straet, in which the Stadthouse was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) himself was going with Margaret
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cousin, in the Ooster-Waagen Straet, so, almost on entering the
gate, their roads lay apart. They bade each other a friendly adieu, and
Gerard dived into the great town. A profound sense of solitude fell upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), yet the streets were crowded. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lamented too late that, out
of delicacy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had not asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) late companions who they were and
where they lived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beshrew my shamefacedness!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But their words and their
breeding were above their means, and something did whisper me they would
not be known. I shall never see her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) more. Oh weary world, I hate you and
your ways. To think I must meet beauty and goodness and learning--three
pearls of price--and never see them more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Falling into this sad reverie, and letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) body go where it would,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) way; but presently meeting a crowd of persons all moving in
one direction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mingled with them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) argued they must be making
for the Stadthouse. Soon the noisy troop that contained the moody Gerard
emerged, not upon the Stadthouse, but upon a large meadow by the side of
the Maas; and then the attraction was revealed. Games of all sorts
were going on: wrestling, the game of palm, the quintain, legerdemain,
archery, tumbling, in which art, I blush to say, women as well as men
performed, to the great delectation of the company. There was also a
trained bear, who stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Maas</b></font>) head, and marched upright, and bowed with
prodigious gravity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Maas</b></font>) master; and a hare that beat a drum, and a
cock that strutted on little stilts disdainfully. These things made
Gerard laugh now and then; but the gay scene could not really enliven
it, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart was not in tune with it. So hearing a young man say
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fellow that the Duke had been in the meadow, but was gone to
the Stadthouse to entertain the burgomasters and aldermen and the
competitors for the prizes, and their friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) suddenly remembered
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was hungry, and should like to sup with a prince. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) left the
river-side, and this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found the Hooch Straet, and it speedily led
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to the Stadthouse. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) got there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was refused, first
at one door, then at another, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came to the great gate of the
courtyard. It was kept by soldiers, and superintended by a pompous
major-domo, glittering in an embroidered collar and a gold chain of
office, and holding a white staff with a gold knob. There was a crowd of
persons at the gate endeavouring to soften this official rock. They came
up in turn like ripples, and retired as such in turn. It cost Gerard a
struggle to get near him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was within four heads of the
gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw something that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart beat; there was Peter, with
Margaret on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) arm, soliciting humbly for entrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My cousin the alderman is not at home; they say he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) is here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that to me, old man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``If you will not let us pass in to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), at least take this leaf from my
tablet to my cousin. See, I have written his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) name; he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) will come out to
us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For what do you take me? I carry no messages, I keep the gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) then bawled, in a stentorian voice, inexorably:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No strangers enter here, but the competitors and their companies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried a voice in the crowd, <div class="bookquote">``you have gotten your
answer; make way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret turned half round imploringly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good people, we are come from far, and my father is old; and my cousin
has a new servant that knows us not, and would not let us sit in our
cousin's house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>At this the crowd laughed hoarsely. Margaret shrank as if they had
struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). At that moment a hand grasped hers--a magic grasp; it felt
like heart meeting heart, or magnet steel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned quickly round at
it, and it was Gerard. Such a little cry of joy and appeal came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
bosom, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) began to whimper prettily.

<p/>They had hustled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), for one thing; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cousin's
thoughtlessness, in not even telling his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) servant they were coming,
was cruel; and the servant's caution, however wise and faithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
master, was bitterly mortifying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). And to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) so
mortified, and anxious and jostled, came suddenly this kind hand and
face. <div class="bookquote">``Hinc illae lacrimae.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All is well now,''  (<font color='red'><b>a humourist</b></font>)</div>remarked a coarse humourist; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hath gotten her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
sweetheart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a humourist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haw! haw! haw!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>went the crowd.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dropped Gerard's hand directly, and turned round, with eyes flashing
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tears:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no sweetheart, you rude men. But I am friendless in your boorish
town, and this is a friend; and one who knows, what you know not, how to
treat the aged and the weak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>The crowd was dead silent. They had only been thoughtless, and now felt
the rebuke, though severe, was just. The silence enabled Gerard to treat
with the porter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a competitor, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your name?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and the man eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suspiciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard, the son of Elias.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The janitor</b></font>)</div><p/>The janitor inspected a slip of parchment he (<font color='blue'><b>janitor</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>janitor</b></font>) hand:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard Eliassoen can enter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With my company, these two?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay; those are not your company they came before you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What matter? They are my friends, and without them I go not in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay without, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will I not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we shall see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will, and speedily.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>And with this, Gerard raised a voice of
astounding volume and power, and routed so that the whole street rang:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho! PHILIP, EARL OF HOLLAND!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you mad?''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>cried the porter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``HERE IS ONE OF YOUR VARLETS DEFIES YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``AND WILL NOT LET YOUR GUESTS PASS IN.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! murder! The Dukes there. I'm dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>the janitor</b></font>)</div>cried the janitor, quaking.

<p/>Then suddenly trying to overpower Gerard's thunder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shouted, with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lungs:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``OPEN THE GATE, YE KNAVES! WAY THERE FOR GERARD ELIASSOEN AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>ELIASSOEN</b></font>)
COMPANY! -LRB-The fiends go with him (<font color='blue'><b>ELIASSOEN</b></font>)!-RRB-''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The gate swung open as by magic. Eight soldiers lowered their pikes
halfway, and made an arch, under which the victorious three marched
in triumphant. The moment they had passed, the pikes clashed together
horizontally to bar the gateway, and all but pinned an abdominal citizen
that sought to wedge in along with them.

<p/>Once past the guarded portal, a few steps brought the trio upon a scene
of Oriental luxury. The courtyard was laid out in tables loaded with
rich meats and piled with gorgeous plate. Guests in rich and various
costumes sat beneath a leafy canopy of fresh-cut branches fastened
tastefully to golden, silver, and blue silken cords that traversed the
area; and fruits of many hues, including some artificial ones of gold,
silver, and wax, hung pendant, or peeped like fair eyes among the green
leaves of plane-trees and lime-trees. The Duke's minstrels swept their
lutes at intervals, and a fountain played red Burgundy in six jets that
met and battled in the air. The evening sun darted its fires through
those bright and purple wine spouts, making them jets and cascades of
molten rubies, then passing on, tinged with the blood of the grape,
shed crimson glories here and there on fair faces, snowy beards, velvet,
satin, jewelled hilts, glowing gold, gleaming silver, and sparkling
glass. Gerard and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friends stood dazzled, spell-bound. Presently
a whisper buzzed round them, <div class="bookquote">``Salute the Duke! Salute the Duke!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They
looked up, and there on high, under the dais, was their sovereign,
bidding them welcome with a kindly wave of the hand. The men bowed low,
and Margaret curtsied with a deep and graceful obeisance. The Duke's
hand being up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gave it another turn, and pointed the new-comers out
to a knot of valets. Instantly seven of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) people, with an obedient
start, went headlong at our friends, seated them at a table, and put
fifteen many-coloured soups before them, in little silver bowls, and as
many wines in crystal vases.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, father, let us not eat until we have thanked our good friend,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, now first recovering from all this bustle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Girl, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is our guardian angel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me when you have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I will reappear and have
my supper, for I am hungry. I know which of us three is the happiest at
meeting again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>inquired Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No: guess again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I have no guess which it can be;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gave a little crow of
happiness and gaiety. The soup was tasted, and vanished in a twirl
of fourteen hands, and fish came on the table in a dozen forms, with
patties of lobster and almonds mixed, and of almonds and cream, and an
immense variety of brouets known to us as rissoles. The next trifle was
a wild boar, which smelt divine. Why, then, did Margaret start away from
it with two shrieks of dismay, and pinch so good a friend as Gerard?
Because the Duke's cuisinier had been too clever; had made this
excellent dish too captivating to the sight as well as taste. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had
restored to the animal, by elaborate mimicry with burnt sugar and other
edible colours, the hair and bristles he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) of by fire and
water. To make him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) still more enticing, the huge tusks were carefully
preserved in the brute's jaw, and gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mouth the winning smile that
comes of tusk in man or beast; and two eyes of coloured sugar glowed
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head. St. Argus! what eyes! so bright, so bloodshot, so
threatening--they followed a man and every movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knife and
spoon. But, indeed, I need the pencil of Granville or Tenniel to make
you see the two gilt valets on the opposite side of the table putting
the monster down before our friends, with a smiling, self-satisfied,
benevolent obsequiousness for this ghastly monster was the flower of all
comestibles--old Peter clasping both hands in pious admiration of
it; Margaret wheeling round with horror-stricken eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand on
Gerard's shoulder, squeaking and pinching; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face of unwise delight at
being pinched, the grizzly brute glaring sulkily on all, and the guests
grinning from ear to ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div>shouted the Duke, hearing the signals of female
distress. Seven of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) people with a zealous start went headlong and
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) laughed and said, <div class="bookquote">``Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Girl</b></font>) of the beef-stuffing, then, and
bring me Sir Boar.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Benevolent monarch! The beef-stuffing was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own
private dish. On these grand occasions an ox was roasted whole, and
reserved for the poor. But this wise as well as charitable prince had
discovered, that whatever venison, bares, lamb, poultry, etc., you
skewered into that beef cavern, got cooked to perfection, retaining
their own juices and receiving those of the reeking ox. These he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) called
his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) beef-stuffing, and took delight therein, as did now our trio;
for, at his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) word, seven of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) people went headlong, and drove silver
tridents into the steaming cave at random, and speared a kid, a cygnet,
and a flock of wildfowl. These presently smoked before Gerard and
company; and Peter's face, sad and slightly morose at the loss of the
savage hog, expanded and shone. After this, twenty different tarts of
fruits and herbs, and last of all, confectionery on a Titanic scale;
cathedrals of sugar, all gilt painted in the interstices of the
bas-reliefs; castles with moats, and ditches imitated to the life;
elephants, camels, toads; knights on horseback jousting; kings and
princesses looking on trumpeters blowing; and all these personages
eating, and their veins filled with sweet-scented juices: works of art
made to be destroyed. The guests breached a bastion, crunched a crusader
and his (<font color='blue'><b>crusader</b></font>) horse and lance, or cracked a bishop, cope, chasuble, crosier
and all, as remorselessly as we do a caraway comfit; sipping meanwhile
hippocras and other spiced drinks, and Greek and Corsican wines, while
every now and then little Turkish boys, turbaned, spangled, jewelled,
and gilt, came offering on bended knee golden troughs of rose-water and
orange-water to keep the guests' hands cool and perfumed.

<p/>But long before our party arrived at this final stage appetite had
succumbed, and Gerard had suddenly remembered he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was the bearer of a
letter to the Princess Marie, and, in an under-tone, had asked one of
the servants if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would undertake to deliver it. The man took it with
a deep obeisance: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) could not deliver it himself, but would instantly
give it one of the Princess's suite, several of whom were about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>It may be remembered that Peter and Margaret came here not to dine, but
to find their cousin. Well, the old gentleman ate heartily, and--being
much fatigued, dropped asleep, and forgot all about his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cousin. Margaret
did not remind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); we shall hear why.

<p/>Meanwhile, that Cousin was seated within a few feet of them, at their
backs, and discovered them when Margaret turned round and screamed
at the boar. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) forbore to speak to them, for municipal reasons.
Margaret was very plainly dressed, and Peter inclined to threadbare. So
the alderman said to himself:

<p/>```Twill be time to make up to them when the sun sets and the company
disperses then I will take my poor relations to my house, and none will
be the wiser.''

<p/>Half the courses were lost on Gerard and Margaret. They were no great
eaters, and just now were feeding on sweet thoughts that have ever been
unfavourable to appetite. But there is a delicate kind of sensuality,
to whose influence these two were perhaps more sensitive than any other
pair in that assembly--the delights of colour, music, and perfume, all
of which blended so fascinatingly here.

<p/>Margaret leaned back and half closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes, and murmured to Gerard:
<div class="bookquote">``What a lovely scene! the warm sun, the green shade, the rich dresses,
the bright music of the lutes and the cool music of the fountain, and
all faces so happy and gay! and then, it is to you we owe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard was silent all but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes; observing which--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, speak not to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Margaret languidly; <div class="bookquote">``let me listen to the
fountain: what are you a competitor for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well! You will gain one prize, at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which? which? have you seen any of my work?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I? no. But you will gain a prize.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so; but what makes you think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you were so good to my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard smiled at the feminine logic, and hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head at the sweet
praise, and was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>murmured Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``They say this is a world of sin and
misery. Can that be? What is your opinion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! that is all a silly old song,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>explained Gerard. ```Tis a byword our
elders keep repeating, out of custom: it is not true.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you know? You are but a child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, with pensive
dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, only look round! And then thought I had lost you for ever; and you
are by my side; and now the minstrels are going to play again. Sin and
misery? Stuff and nonsense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The lutes burst out. The courtyard rang again with their delicate
harmony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you admire most of all these beautiful things, Gerard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know my name? How is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``White magic. I am a--witch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angels are never witches. But I can't think how you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Foolish boy! was it not cried at the gate loud enough to deave one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it was. Where is my head? What do I admire most? If you will sit a
little more that way, I'll tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; so that the light may fall on you. There! I see many fair things
here, fairer than I could have conceived; but the fairest of all, to
my eye, is your lovely hair in its silver frame, and the setting sun
kissing it. It minds me of what the Vulgate praises for beauty, `an
apple of gold in a network of silver,' and oh, what a pity I did not
know you before I sent in my poor endeavours at illuminating! I could
illuminate so much better now. I could do everything better. There, now
the sun is full on it, it is like an aureole. So our Lady looked, and
none since her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) until to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, fie! it is wicked to talk so. Compare a poor, coarse-favoured girl
like me with the Queen of Heaven? Oh, Gerard! I thought you were a good
young man.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>And Margaret was shocked apparently.

<p/>Gerard tried to explain. <div class="bookquote">``I am no worse than the rest; but how can I
help having eyes, and a heart Margaret!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be not angry now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, is it likely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for shame! you must not say that to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>and Margaret coloured
furiously at this sudden assault.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it. I love you. I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush! for pity's sake! I must not listen to such words from a
stranger. I am ungrateful to call you a stranger. Oh! how one may be
mistaken! If I had known you were so bold--''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>And Margaret's bosom began
to heave, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cheeks were covered with blushes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) looked
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sleeping father, very much like a timid thing that meditates
actual flight.

<p/>Then Gerard was frightened at the alarm he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) caused. <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
imploringly. <div class="bookquote">``How could any one help loving you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, I will try and forgive you--you are so good in other
respects; but then you must promise me never to say you--to say that
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me your hand then, or you don't forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hesitated; but eventually put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand a very little way, very
slowly, and with seeming reluctance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took it, and held it prisoner.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thought it had been there long enough, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tried gently to draw
it away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) held it tight: it submitted quite patiently to force.
What is the use resisting force. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) long
eyelashes drooped sweetly. Gerard lost nothing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) promise. Words
were not needed here; and silence was more eloquent. Nature was in that
day what she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is in ours; but manners were somewhat freer. Then as now,
virgins drew back alarmed at the first words of love; but of prudery
and artificial coquetry there was little, and the young soon read one
another's hearts. Everything was on Gerard's side, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) good looks, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
belief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) goodness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gratitude; and opportunity for at the Duke's
banquet this mellow summer eve, all things disposed the female nature
to tenderness: the avenues to the heart lay open; the senses were so
soothed and subdued with lovely colours, gentle sounds, and delicate
odours; the sun gently sinking, the warm air, the green canopy, the cool
music of the now violet fountain.

<p/>Gerard and Margaret sat hand in hand in silence; and Gerard's eyes
sought hers lovingly; and hers now and then turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) timidly and
imploringly and presently two sweet unreasonable tears rolled down her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
cheeks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) smiled while they were drying: yet they did not take
long.

<p/>And the sun declined; and the air cooled; and the fountain plashed more
gently; and the pair throbbed in unison and silence, and this weary
world looked heaven to them.

<p/>Oh, the merry days, the merry days when we were young.
Oh, the merry days, the merry days when we were young.



<p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>A grave white-haired seneschal came to their table, and inquired
courteously whether Gerard Eliassoen was of their company. Upon Gerard's
answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Princess Marie would confer with you, young sir; I am to conduct
you to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) presence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Instantly all faces within hearing turned sharp round, and were bent
with curiosity and envy on the man that was to go to a princess.

<p/>Gerard rose to obey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wager we shall not see you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret calmly, but
colouring a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was the reply: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) whispered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ear: <div class="bookquote">``This is
my good princess; but you are my queen.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added aloud: <div class="bookquote">``Wait for me, I
pray you, I will presently return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Buyskens</b></font>)</div>said Peter, awaking and speaking at one and the same moment.

<p/>Gerard gone, the pair whose dress was so homely, yet they were with the
man whom the Princess sent for, became <div class="bookquote">``the cynosure of neighbouring
eyes;''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>observing which, William Johnson came forward, acted surprise,
and claimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) relations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to think that there was I at your backs, and you saw me not''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, cousin Johnson, I saw you long syne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You saw me, and spoke not to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cousin, it was for you to welcome us to Rotterdam, as it is for us
to welcome you at Sevenbergen. Your servant denied us a seat in your
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The idiot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I had a mind to see whether it was `like maid like master:' for
there is sooth in bywords.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Johnson/William Johnson</b></font>)</div><p/>William Johnson blushed purple. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) saw Margaret was keen, and suspected
him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) did the wisest thing under the circumstances, trusted to deeds
not words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) insisted on their coming home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) at once, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)
would show them whether they were welcome to Rotterdam or not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who doubts it, cousin? Who doubts it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the scholar</b></font>)</div>said the scholar.

<p/>Margaret thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) graciously, but demurred to go just now: said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wanted to hear the minstrels again. In about a quarter of an hour
Johnson renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) proposal, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) observe that many of the
guests had left. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) real reason came out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It were ill manners to our friend; and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will lose us. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knows not
where we lodge in Rotterdam, and the city is large, and we have parted
company once already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Johnson/William Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Johnson, <div class="bookquote">``we will provide for that. My young man, ahem!
I mean my secretary, shall sit here and wait, and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) on to my
house: he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) shall lodge with me and with no other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Johnson/William Johnson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cousin, we shall be too burdensome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay; you shall see whether you are welcome or not, you and your
friends, and your friends' friends, if need be; and I shall hear what
the Princess would with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret felt a thrill of joy that Gerard should be lodged under the
same roof with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had a slight misgiving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if your young man should be thoughtless, and go play, and Gerard
miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) go play? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) leave that spot where I put him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stay? Ho!
stand forth, Hans Cloterman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A figure clad in black serge and dark violet hose arose, and took two
steps and stood before them without moving a muscle: a solemn, precise
young man, the very statue of gravity and starched propriety. At his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
aspect Margaret, being very happy, could hardly keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) countenance.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) whispered Johnson, <div class="bookquote">``I would put my hand in the fire for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cloterman</b></font>). We
are at your command, cousin, as soon as you have given him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) orders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Johnson/William Johnson</b></font>)</div><p/>Hans was then instructed to sit at the table and wait for Gerard, and
conduct him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to Ooster-Waagen Straet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) replied, not in words, but
by calmly taking the seat indicated, and Margaret, Peter, and William
Johnson went away together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, indeed, it is time you were abed, father, after all your travel,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. This had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind all along.

<p/>Hans Cloterman sat waiting for Gerard, solemn and businesslike. The
minutes flew by, but excited no impatience in that perfect young man.
Johnson did him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) no more than justice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) laughed to scorn the idea
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) secretary leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) post or neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) duty in pursuit of
sport or out of youthful hilarity and frivolity.

<p/>As Gerard was long in coming, the patient Hans--his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) employer's eye being
no longer on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) improved the time by quaffing solemnly, silently, and
at short but accurately measured intervals, goblets of Corsican wine.
The wine was strong, so was Cloterman's head; and Gerard had been gone
a good hour ere the model secretary imbibed the notion that Creation
expected Cloterman to drink the health of all good fellows, and
nommement of the Duke of Burgundy there present. With this view he (<font color='blue'><b>Cloterman</b></font>)
filled bumper nine, and rose gingerly but solemnly and slowly. Having
reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Cloterman</b></font>) full height, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cloterman</b></font>) instantly rolled upon the grass, goblet
in hand, spilling the cold liquor on more than one ankle--whose owners
frisked--but not disturbing a muscle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cloterman</b></font>) own long face, which, in
the total eclipse of reason, retained its gravity, primness, and
infallibility.

<p/>The seneschal led Gerard through several passages to the door of the
pavilion, where some young noblemen, embroidered and feathered, sat
sentinel, guarding the heir-apparent, and playing cards by the red light
of torches their servants held. A whisper from the seneschal, and one
of them rose reluctantly, stared at Gerard with haughty surprise, and
entered the pavilion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) presently returned, and, beckoning the pair,
led then, through a passage or two and landed them in an ante-chamber,
where sat three more young gentlemen, feathered, furred, and embroidered
like pieces of fancy work, and deep in that instructive and edifying
branch of learning, dice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't see the Princess--it is too late,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one.

<p/>Another followed suit:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) passed this way but now with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) nurse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) is gone to bed, doll
and all. Deuce--ace again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard prepared to retire. The seneschal, with an incredulous smile,
replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The young man is here by the Countess's orders; be so good as conduct
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The seneschal</b></font>)</div><p/>On this a superb Adonis rose, with an injured look, and led Gerard into
a room where sat or lolloped eleven ladies, chattering like magpies.
Two, more industrious than the rest, were playing cat's-cradle with
fingers as nimble as their tongues. At the sight of a stranger all the
tongues stopped like one piece of complicated machinery, and all the
eyes turned on Gerard, as if the same string that checked the tongues
had turned the eyes on. Gerard was ill at ease before, but this battery
of eyes discountenanced him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and down went his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes on the ground. Then
the cowards finding, like the hare who ran by the pond and the frogs
scuttled into the water, that there was a creature they could frighten,
giggled and enjoyed their prowess. Then a duenna said severely,
<div class="bookquote">``Mesdames!''  (<font color='red'><b>a duenna</b></font>)</div>and they were all abashed at once as though a modesty string
had been pulled. This same duenna took Gerard, and marched before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
in solemn silence. The young man's heart sank, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had half a mind to
turn and run out of the place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What must princes be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``when their courtiers are so
freezing? Doubtless they take their breeding from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) they serve.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>These
reflections were interrupted by the duenna suddenly introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) into
a room where three ladies sat working, and a pretty little girl tuning
a lute. The ladies were richly but not showily dressed, and the duenna
went up to the one who was hemming a kerchief, and said a few words in
a low tone. This lady then turned towards Gerard with a smile, and
beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to come near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not rise, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) laid aside her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
work, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) manner of turning towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), slight as the movement was,
was full of grace and ease and courtesy. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) began a conversation at
once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret Van Eyck is an old friend of mine, sir, and I am right glad to
have a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) hand, and thankful to you, sir, for bringing it
to me safely. Marie, my love, this is the gentleman who brought you that
pretty miniature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I thank you a thousand times,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady.

<p/>``I am glad you feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) debtor, sweetheart, for our friend would have us
to do him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a little service in return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do anything on earth for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady with
ardour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything on earth is nothing in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>said the Countess of
Charolois quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I will--What would you have me to do, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard had just found out what high society he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was in. <div class="bookquote">``My sovereign
demoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), gently and a little tremulously, <div class="bookquote">``where there have
been no pains, there needs no reward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But we must obey mamma. All the world must obey

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true. Then, our demoiselle, reward me, if you will by letting
me hear the stave you were going to sing and I did interrupt it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! you love music, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I adore it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The princess</b></font>)</div><p/>The little princess looked inquiringly at her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) mother, and received a
smile of assent. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) then took her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) lute and sang a romaunt of the day.
Although but twelve years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was a well-taught and painstaking
musician. Her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) little claw swept the chords with Courage and precision,
and struck out the notes of the arpeggio clear, and distinct, and
bright, like twinkling stars; but the main charm was her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) voice. It was
not mighty, but it was round, clear, full, and ringing like a bell. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
sang with a certain modest eloquence, though she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) knew none of the tricks
of feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was too young to be theatrical, or even sentimental,
so nothing was forced--all gushed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) little mouth seemed the mouth of
Nature. The ditty, too, was as pure as its utterance. As there were none
of those false divisions--those whining slurs, which are now sold so
dear by Italian songsters, though every jackal in India delivers them
gratis to his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) customers all night, and sometimes gets shot for them, and
always deserves it--so there were no cadences and fiorituri, the trite,
turgid, and feeble expletives of song, the skim-milk with which mindless
musicians and mindless writers quench fire, wash out colour, and drown
melody and meaning dead.

<p/>While the pure and tender strain was flowing from the pure young throat,
Gerard's eyes filled. The Countess watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with interest, for it
was usual to applaud the Princess loudly, but not with cheek and eye.
So when the voice ceased, and the glasses left off ringing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) asked
demurely, <div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) content?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard gave a little start; the spoken voice broke a charm and brought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) back to earth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, madam!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``surely it is thus that cherubs and seraphs sing,
and charm the saints in heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am somewhat of your opinion, my young friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess look</b></font>)</div>said the Countess,
with emotion; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) bent a look of love and gentle pride upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
girl: a heavenly look, such as, they say, is given to the eye of the
short-lived resting on the short-lived.

<p/>The Countess resumed: <div class="bookquote">``My old friend request me to be serviceable to
you. It is the first favour she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) has done us the honour of asking us, and
the request is sacred. You are in holy orders, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard bowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear you are not a priest, you look too young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, madam; I am not even a sub-deacon. I am only a lector; but next
month I shall be an exorcist, and before long an acolyth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Monsieur Gerard, with your accomplishments you can soon pass
through the inferior orders. And let me beg you to do so. For the
day after you have said your first mass I shall have the pleasure of
appointing you to a benefice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, madam!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, Marie, remember I make this promise in your name as well as my
own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Fear not, mamma: I will not forget. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will take my advice,
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will be is Bishop of Liege. The Bishop of Liege is a beautiful
bishop. What! do you not remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>), mamma, that day we were at Liege?
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) was braver than grandpapa himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) had on a crown, a high one, and
it was cut in the middle, and it was full of oh! such beautiful jewels;
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) gown stiff with gold; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) mantle, too; and it had a broad
border, all pictures; but, above all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) gloves; you have no such
gloves, mamma. They were embroidered and covered with jewels, and
scented with such lovely scent; I smelt them all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) was giving
me his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) blessing on my head with them. Dear old man! I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) will
die soon most old people do and then, sir, you Can be bishop you know,
and wear--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gently, Marie, gently: bishoprics are for old gentlemen; and this is a
young gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Mamma! he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is not so very young.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not compared with you, Marie, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a good birth dear mamma; and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is good enough for a
bishop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! mademoiselle, you are mistaken''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know not that, Monsieur Gerard; but I am a little puzzled to know on
what grounds mademoiselle there pronounces your character so boldly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess, <div class="bookquote">``you have not looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face,
then;''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) eyebrows at her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) mother's simplicity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>said the Countess, <div class="bookquote">``I have. Well, sir, if I cannot
go quite so fast as my daughter, attribute it to my age, not to a want
of interest in your welfare. A benefice will do to begin your Career
with; and I must take care it is not too far from--what call you the
place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>``Tergou, madam

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A priest gives up much,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>continued the Countess; <div class="bookquote">``often, I fear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
learns too late how much;''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) woman's eye rested a moment on Gerard
with mild pity and half surprise at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) resigning her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) sex and all the
heaven they can bestow, and the great parental joys: <div class="bookquote">``at least you shall
be near your friends. Have you a mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, madam, thanks be to God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! You shall have a church near Tergou. She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) will thank me. And now,
sir, we must not detain you too long from those who have a better claim
on your society than we have. Duchess, oblige me by bidding one of the
pages conduct him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to the hall of banquet; the way is hard to find.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard bowed low to the Countess and the Princess, and backed towards
the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it will be a nice benefice,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), with a
pretty smile, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was going out; then, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) head with an air of
solemn misgiving, <div class="bookquote">``but you had better have been Bishop of Liege.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) new conductor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart warm with gratitude; but
ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reached the banquet-hall a chill came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). The mind of one
who has led a quiet, uneventful life is not apt to take in contradictory
feelings at the same moment and balance them, but rather to be
overpowered by each in turn. While Gerard was with the Countess, the
excitement of so new a situation, the unlooked-for promise the joy
and pride it would cause at home, possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wholly; but now it was
passion's turn to be heard again. What! give up Margaret, whose soft
hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) still felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) deep eyes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart? resign her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
and all the world of love and joy she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had opened on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to-day? The
revulsion, when it did come, was so strong that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hastily resolved
to say nothing at home about the offered benefice. <div class="bookquote">``The Countess is
so good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) has a hundred ways of aiding a young man's
fortune: she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) will not compel me to be a priest when she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) shall learn I
love one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) sex: one would almost think she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) does know it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
cast a strange look on me, and said, `A priest gives up much, too much.'
I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) will give me a place about the palace.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And with this
hopeful reflection his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mind was eased, and, being now at the entrance
of the banqueting hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thanked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) conductor, and ran hastily with
joyful eyes to Margaret. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came in sight of the table--she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was gone.
Peter was gone too. Nobody was at the table at all; only a citizen in
sober garments had just tumbled under it dead drunk, and several persons
were raising him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) away. Gerard never guessed how important
this solemn drunkard was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was looking for <div class="bookquote">``Beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
let the <div class="bookquote">``Beast''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>lie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ran wildly round the hall, which was now
comparatively empty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was not there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) left the palace: outside he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
found a crowd gaping at two great fan-lights just lighted over the gate.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) asked them earnestly if they had seen an old man in a gown, and a
lovely girl pass out. They laughed at the question. <div class="bookquote">``They were staring
at these new lights that turn night into day. They didn't trouble their
heads about old men and young wenches, every-day sights.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>From another
group he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) learned there was a Mystery being played under canvas hard by,
and all the world gone to see it. This revived his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hopes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went
and saw the Mystery.

<p/>In this representation divine personages, too sacred for me to name
here, came clumsily down from heaven to talk sophistry with the cardinal
Virtues, the nine Muses, and the seven deadly sins, all present in
human shape, and not unlike one another. To enliven which weary stuff
in rattled the Prince of the power of the air, and an imp that kept
molesting him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) and buffeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) with a bladder, at each thwack of which
the crowd were in ecstasies. When the Vices had uttered good store of
obscenity and the Virtues twaddle, the celestials, including the nine
Muses went gingerly back to heaven one by one; for there was but one
cloud; and two artisans worked it up with its supernatural freight,
and worked it down with a winch, in full sight of the audience. These
disposed of, the bottomless pit opened and flamed in the centre of the
stage; the carpenters and Virtues shoved the Vices in, and the Virtues
and Beelzebub and his (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) tormentor danced merrily round the place of
eternal torture to the fife and tabor.

<p/>This entertainment was writ by the Bishop of Ghent for the diffusion
of religious sentiment by the aid of the senses, and was an average
specimen of theatrical exhibitions so long as they were in the hands of
the clergy. But, in course of time, the laity conducted plays, and so
the theatre, I learn from the pulpit, has become profane.

<p/>Margaret was nowhere in the crowd, and Gerard could not enjoy the
performance; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) actually went away in Act 2, in the midst of a
much-admired piece of dialogue, in which Justice out-quibbled Satan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>)
walked through many streets, but could not find her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) sought. At last,
fairly worn out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) went to a hostelry and slept till daybreak. All that
day, heavy and heartsick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), but could never fall in with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father, nor ever obtain the slightest clue. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
was false or had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was irritated now, as well as sad.
More good fortune fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) almost hated it. At last, on the third
day, after he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had once more been through every street, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) is
not in the town, and I shall never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) again. I will go home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) started for Tergou with royal favour promised, with fifteen golden
angels in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) purse, a golden medal on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bosom, and a heart like a
lump of lead.



<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>It was near four o’clock in the afternoon. Eli was in the shop. His (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>)
eldest and youngest sons were abroad. Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) little crippled
daughter had long been anxious about Gerard, and now they were gone a
little way down the road, to see if by good luck he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) might be visible
in the distance; and Giles was alone in the sitting-room, which I will
sketch, furniture and dwarf included.

<p/>The Hollanders were always an original and leading people. They claim
to have invented printing -LRB-wooden type-RRB-, oil-painting, liberty,
banking, gardening, etc.. Above all, years before my tale, they invented
cleanliness. So, while the English gentry, in velvet jerkins and
chicken-toed shoes, trode floors of stale rushes, foul receptacle of
bones, decomposing morsels, spittle, dogs, eggs, and all abominations,
this hosier's sitting-room at Tergou was floored with Dutch tiles, so
highly glazed and constantly washed, that you could eat off them. There
was one large window; the cross stone-work in the centre of it was
very massive, and stood in relief, looking like an actual cross to the
inmates, and was eyed as such in their devotions. The panes were very
small and lozenge-shaped, and soldered to one another with strips of
lead: the like you may see to this day in our rural cottages. The chairs
were rude and primitive, all but the arm-chair, whose back, at right
angles with its seat, was so high that the sitter's head stopped two
feet short of the top. This chair was of oak, and carved at the summit.
There was a copper pail, that went in at the waist, holding holy water,
and a little hand-besom to sprinkle it far and wide; and a long, narrow,
but massive oak table, and a dwarf sticking to its rim by his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) teeth, his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>)
eyes glaring, and his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) claws in the air like a pouncing vampire. Nature,
it would seem, did not make Giles a dwarf out of malice prepense; she (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>)
constructed a head and torso with her (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) usual care; but just then her (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>)
attention was distracted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) left the rest to chance; the result
was a human wedge, an inverted cone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) might justly have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) to
task in the terms of Horace,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amphora coepit
Institui; currente rota cur urceus exit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Horace</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) centre was anything but his (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) centre of gravity. Bisected, upper Giles
would have outweighed three lower Giles. But this very disproportion
enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) to do feats that would have baffled Milo. His (<font color='blue'><b>Milo</b></font>) brawny arms
had no weight to draw after them; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Milo</b></font>) could go up a vertical pole like
a squirrel, and hang for hours from a bough by one hand like a cherry by
its stalk. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Milo</b></font>) could have made a vacuum with his (<font color='blue'><b>Milo</b></font>) hands, as the lizard
is said to do with its feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Milo</b></font>) would have gone along a ceiling. Now,
this pocket-athlete was insanely fond of gripping the dinner-table with
both hands, and so swinging; and then--climax of delight! he (<font color='blue'><b>Milo</b></font>) would seize
it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Milo</b></font>) teeth, and, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Milo</b></font>) hands, hold on like grim death by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Milo</b></font>) huge ivories.

<p/>But all our joys, however elevating, suffer interruption. Little Kate
caught Sampsonet in this posture, and stood aghast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mother's
daughter, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) heart was with the furniture, not with the 12mo
gymnast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Giles! how can you? Mother is at hand. It dents the table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), little tale-bearer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>snarled Giles. <div class="bookquote">``You are the one
for making mischief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>inquired Kate calmly; <div class="bookquote">``that is news to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The biggest in Tergou,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>growled Giles, fastening on again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate drily.

<p/>This piece of unwonted satire launched, and Giles not visibly blasted,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sat down quietly and cried.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mother came in almost at that moment, and Giles hurled himself under
the table, and there glared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to do now?''  (<font color='red'><b>the dame</b></font>)</div>said the dame sharply. Then turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) experienced
eyes from Kate to Giles, and observing the position he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had taken up, and
a sheepish expression, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hinted at cuffing of ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl; <div class="bookquote">``it was but a foolish word Giles spoke.
I had not noticed it at another time; but I was tired and in care for
Gerard, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let no one be in care for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said a faint voice at the door, and in
tottered Gerard, pale, dusty, and worn out; and amidst uplifted hands
and cries of delight, curiosity, and anxiety mingled, dropped exhausted
into the nearest chair.

<p/>Beating Rotterdam, like a covert, for Margaret, and the long journey
afterwards, had fairly knocked Gerard up. But elastic youth soon
revived, and behold him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) the centre of an eager circle. First of all they
must hear about the prizes. Then Gerard told them he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been admitted
to see the competitors' works, all laid out in an enormous hall before
the judges pronounced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother! oh, Kate! when I saw the goldsmiths' work, I had liked to
have fallen on the floor. I thought not all the goldsmiths on earth had
so much gold, silver, jewels, and craft of design and facture. But, in
sooth, all the arts are divine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the females</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, to please the females, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) described to them the reliquaries,
feretories, calices, crosiers, crosses, pyxes, monstrances, and other
wonders ecclesiastical, and the goblets, hanaps, watches, Clocks,
chains, brooches, &c., so that their mouths watered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Kate, when I came to the illuminated work from Ghent and Bruges,
my heart sank. Mine was dirt by the side of it. For the first minute I
could almost have cried; but I prayed for a better spirit, and presently
I was able to enjoy them, and thank God for those lovely works, and
for those skilful, patient craftsmen, whom I own my masters. Well, the
coloured work was so beautiful I forgot all about the black and white.
But next day, when all the other prizes had been given, they came to the
writing, and whose name think you was called first?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate.

<p/>The others laughed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) to scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well laugh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``but for all that, Gerard Eliassoen
of Tergou was the name the herald shouted. I stood stupid; they thrust
me forward. Everything swam before my eyes. I found myself kneeling on
a cushion at the feet of the Duke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) said something to me, but I was so
fluttered I could not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>). So then he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) side,
and did not draw a glaive and cut off my dull head, but gave me a gold
medal, and there it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>There was a yell and almost a scramble. <div class="bookquote">``And
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) gave me fifteen great bright golden angels. I had seen one
before, but I never handled one. Here they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gerard! oh, Gerard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is one for you, our eldest; and one for you, Sybrandt, and for
you, Little Mischief; and two for thee, Little Lily, because God hath
afflicted thee; and one for myself, to buy colours and vellum; and nine
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) that nursed us all, and risked the two crowns upon poor Gerard's
hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div><p/>The gold drew out their characters. Cornelis and Sybrandt clutched each
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) coin with one glare of greediness and another glare of envy at Kate,
who had got two pieces. Giles seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) and rolled it along the floor
and gambolled after it. Kate put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) crutches and sat down, and
held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) little arms to Gerard with a heavenly gesture of love and
tenderness; and the mother, fairly benumbed at first by the shower of
gold that fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) apron, now cried out, <div class="bookquote">``Leave kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), Kate;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is my son, not yours. Ah. Gerard! my boy! I have not loved you as you
deserved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Gerard threw himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees beside her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and wept for joy and pride upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good lad! good lad!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the hosier, with some emotion. <div class="bookquote">``I must go
and tell the neighbours. Lend me the medal, Gerard; I'll show it my good
friend Peter Buyskens; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is ever regaling me with how his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) son Jorian
won the tin mug a shooting at the butts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, do, my man; and show Peter Buyskens one of the angels. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Buyskens</b></font>)
there are fourteen more where that came from. Mind you bring it me
back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay a minute, father; there is better news behind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard,
flushing with joy at the joy he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) caused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better! better than this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Gerard told his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) interview with the Countess, and the house rang
with joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, God bless the good lady, and bless the dame Van Eyck! A benefice?
our son! My cares are at an end. Eli, my good friend and master, now we
two can die happy whenever our time comes. This dear boy will take our
place, and none of these loved ones will want a home or a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>From that hour Gerard was looked upon as the stay of the family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
was a son apart, but in another sense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was always in the right, and
nothing too good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Cornelis and Sybrandt became more and more
jealous of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and longed for the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) benefice;
they would get rid of the favourite, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reverence's purse would be
open to them. With these views he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) co-operated. The wound love had
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) throbbed duller and duller. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) success and the affection and
admiration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) parents made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) think more highly of himself, and
resent with more spirit Margaret's ingratitude and discourtesy. For all
that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had power to cool him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) towards the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sex, and now for
every reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wished to be ordained priest as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could pass
the intermediate orders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knew the Vulgate already better than most of
the clergy, and studied the rubric and the dogmas of the Church with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friends the monks; and, the first time the bishop came that way, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
applied to be admitted <div class="bookquote">``exorcist,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the third step in holy orders. The
bishop questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), and ordained him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had to kneel, and,
after a short prayer, the bishop delivered to him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) a little MS. full of
exorcisms, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Take this, Gerard, and have power to lay hands
on the possessed, whether baptized or catechumens!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) took it
reverently, and went home invested by the Church with power to cast out
demons.

<p/>Returning home from the church, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was met by little Kate on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
crutches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gerard! who, think you, hath sent to our house seeking you?--the
burgomaster himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ghysbrecht Van Swieten! What would he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Gerard, I know not. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) seems urgent to see you. You are to go
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) house on the instant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is the burgomaster: I will go; but it likes me not. Kate, I
have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cast such a look on me as no friend casts. No matter; such
looks forewarn the wise. To be sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Knows what, Gerard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kate, I'll go.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>Ghysbrecht Van Swieten was an artful man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) opened on the novice with
something quite wide of the mark he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) was really aiming at. <div class="bookquote">``The town
records,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are crabbedly written, and the ink rusty with age.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) offered Gerard the honour of transcribing them fair.

<p/>Gerard inquired what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was to be paid.

<p/>Ghysbrecht offered a sum that would have just purchased the pens, ink,
and parchment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, burgomaster, my labour? Here is a year's work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your labour? Call you marking parchment labour? Little sweat goes to
that, I trow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis labour, and skilled labour to boot; and that is better paid in all
crafts than rude labour, sweat or no sweat. Besides, there's my time.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your time? Why, what is time to you, at two-and-twenty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>Then fixing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) eyes keenly on Gerard, to mark the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said:
<div class="bookquote">``Say, rather, you are idle grown. You are in love. Your body is with
these chanting monks, but your heart is with Peter Brandt and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>)
red-haired girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know no Peter Brandt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>This denial confirmed Ghysbrecht's suspicion that the caster-out of
demons was playing a deep game.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye lie!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Did I not find you at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) elbow on the road to
Rotterdam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! And you were seen at Sevenbergen but t'other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Was I?'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah and at Peter's house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Sevenbergen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, at Sevenbergen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, this was what in modern days is called a draw. It was a guess, put
boldly forth as fact, to elicit by the young man's answer whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
been there lately or not.

<p/>The result of the artifice surprised the crafty one. Gerard started up
in a strange state of nervous excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Burgomaster,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), with trembling voice, <div class="bookquote">``I have not been at
Sevenbergen these three years, and I know not the name of those you saw
me with, nor where they dwelt; but, as my time is precious, though
you value it not, give you good day.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) darted out, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes
sparkling.

<p/>Ghysbrecht started up in huge ire; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) sank into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) chair again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) fears me not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knows something, if not all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) called hastily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) trusty servant, and almost dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) to
a window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See you yon man?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Haste! follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! But let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not see
you. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is young, but old in craft. Keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in sight all day. Let me
know whither he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><p/>It was night when the servant returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well? well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>cried Van Swieten eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master, the young man went from you to Sevenbergen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>Ghysbrecht groaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the house of Peter the Magician.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look into your own heart and write!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Herr Cant; and earth's
cuckoos echoed the cry. Look into the Rhine where it is deepest, and the
Thames where it is thickest, and paint the bottom. Lower a bucket into
a well of self-deception, and what comes up must be immortal truth,
mustn't it? Now, in the first place, no son of Adam ever reads his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own
heart at all, except by the habit acquired, and the light gained, from
some years perusal of other hearts; and even then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) acquired
sagacity and reflected light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) can but spell and decipher his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) own
heart, not read it fluently. Half way to Sevenbergen Gerard looked into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own heart, and asked it why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was going to Sevenbergen. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart
replied without a moment's hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``We are going out of curiosity
to know why she (<font color='blue'><b>Magician</b></font>) jilted us, and to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Magician</b></font>) it has not broken our hearts,
and that we are quite content with our honours and our benefice in
prospectu, and don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Magician</b></font>) nor ally of her (<font color='blue'><b>Magician</b></font>) fickle sex.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) soon found out Peter Brandt's cottage; and there sat a girl in the
doorway, plying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) needle, and a stalwart figure leaned on a long bow
and talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Gerard felt an unaccountable pang at the sight of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). However, the man turned out to be past fifty years of age, an old
soldier, whom Gerard remembered to have seen shoot at the butts with
admirable force and skill. Another minute and the youth stood before
them. Margaret looked up and dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) work, and uttered a faint cry,
and was white and red by turns. But these signs of emotion were swiftly
dismissed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned far more chill and indifferent than she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had not betrayed this agitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! is it you, Master Gerard? What on earth brings you here, I
wonder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was passing by and saw you; so I thought I would give you good day,
and ask after your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father is well. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be here anon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I may as well stay till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you will. Good Martin, step into the village and tell my father here
is a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And not of yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father's friends are mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is doubtful. It was not like a friend to promise to wait for me,
and then make off the moment my back was turned. Cruel Margaret you
little know how I searched the town for you; how for want of you nothing
was pleasant to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are idle words; if you had desired my father's company, or mine,
you would have come back. There I had a bed laid for you, sir, at my
cousin's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would have made much of you, and, who knows, I might
have made much of you too. I was in the humour that day. You will
not catch me in the same mind again, neither you nor any young man, I
warrant me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret, I came back the moment the Countess let me go; but you were
not there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, you did not, or you had seen Hans Cloterman at our table; we left
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cloterman</b></font>) to bring you on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw no one there, but only a drunken man, that had just tumbled
down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At our table? How was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I took little heed: in sad-coloured garb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>At this Margaret's face gradually warmed; but presently, assuming
incredulity and severity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) put many shrewd questions, all of which
Gerard answered most loyally. Finally, the clouds cleared, and they
guessed how the misunderstanding had come about. Then came a revulsion
of tenderness, all the more powerful that they had done each other
wrong; and then, more dangerous still, came mutual confessions. Neither
had been happy since; neither ever would have been happy but for this
fortunate meeting.

<p/>And Gerard found a MS. Vulgate lying open on the table, and pounced upon
it like a hawk. MSS. were his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) delight; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could get to it two
white hands quickly came flat upon the page, and a red face over them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, take away your hands, Margaret, that I may see where you are
reading, and I will read there too at home; so shall my soul meet yours
in the sacred page. You will not? Nay, then I must kiss them away.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) kissed them so often, that for very shame they were fain to withdraw,
and, lo! the sacred book lay open at,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An apple of gold in a network of silver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I had been hunting for it ever so long,
and found it but even now--and to be caught!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and with a touch of
inconsistency she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pointed it out to Gerard with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) white finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but to-day it is all hidden in that great cap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a comely cap, I'm told by some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe; but what it hides is beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not: it is hideous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it was beautiful at Rotterdam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, everything was beautiful that day''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a little sigh-RRB-.

<p/>And now Peter came in, and welcomed Gerard cordially, and would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
to stay supper. And Margaret disappeared; and Gerard had a nice learned
chat with Peter; and Margaret reappeared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hair in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) silver
net, and shot a glance half arch, half coy, and glided about them, and
spread supper, and beamed bright with gaiety and happiness. And in
the cool evening Gerard coaxed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) objected and came; and
coaxed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) on to the road to Tergou, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) declined, and came; and
there they strolled up and down, hand in hand; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) must go, they
pledged each other never to quarrel or misunderstand one another again;
and they sealed the promise with a long loving kiss, and Gerard went
home on wings.

<p/>From that day Gerard spent most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) evenings with Margaret, and the
attachment deepened and deepened on both sides, till the hours they
spent together were the hours they lived; the rest they counted and
underwent. And at the outset of this deep attachment all went smoothly.
Obstacles there were, but they seemed distant and small to the eyes of
hope, youth, and love. The feelings and passions of so many persons,
that this attachment would thwart, gave no warning smoke to show
their volcanic nature and power. The course of true love ran smoothly,
placidly, until it had drawn these two young hearts into its current for
ever.

<p/>And then--



<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>One bright morning unwonted velvet shone, unwonted feathers waved, and
horses' hoofs glinted and ran through the streets of Tergou, and the
windows and balconies were studded with wondering faces. The French
ambassador was riding through to sport in the neighbouring forest.

<p/>Besides his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) own suite, he (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) was attended by several servants of the Duke
of Burgundy, lent to do him (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) honour and minister to his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) pleasure. The
Duke's tumbler rode before him (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) with a grave, sedate majesty, that made
his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) more noble companions seem light, frivolous persons. But ever and
anon, when respect and awe neared the oppressive, he (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) rolled off his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>)
horse so ignobly and funnily, that even the ambassador was fain' to
burst out laughing. He (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) also climbed up again by the tail in a way
provocative of mirth, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) played his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) part. Towards the rear of the
pageant rode one that excited more attention still--the Duke's leopard.
A huntsman, mounted on a Flemish horse of giant prodigious size and
power, carried a long box fastened to the rider's loins by straps
curiously contrived, and on this box sat a bright leopard crouching.
She (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) was chained to the huntsman. The people admired her (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) glossy hide
and spots, and pressed near, and one or two were for feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>),
and pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) tail; then the huntsman shouted in a terrible voice,
<div class="bookquote">``Beware! At Antwerp one did but throw a handful of dust at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and the
Duke made dust of him (<font color='blue'><b>Duke</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the huntsman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gramercy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak sooth. The good Duke shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Duke</b></font>) up in prison, in a cell under
ground, and the rats cleaned the flesh off his (<font color='blue'><b>Duke</b></font>) bones in a night. Served
him (<font color='blue'><b>Duke</b></font>) right for molesting the poor thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a murmur of fear, and the Tergovians shrank from tickling the
leopard of their sovereign.

<p/>But an incident followed that raised their spirits again. The Duke's
giant, a Hungarian seven feet four inches high, brought up the rear.
This enormous creature had, like some other giants, a treble, fluty
voice of little power. He (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) was a vain fellow, and not conscious of this
nor any defect. Now it happened he (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) caught sight of Giles sitting on the
top of the balcony; so he (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) stopped and began to make fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo! brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>squeaked he (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I had nearly passed without seeing
thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are plain enough to see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>bellowed Giles in his (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) bass tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on my shoulder, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>squeaked Titan, and held out a shoulder
of mutton fist to help him (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I do I'll cuff your ears,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div>roared the dwarf.

<p/>The giant saw the homuncule was irascible, and played upon him (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>), being
encouraged thereto by the shouts of laughter. For he (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) did not see
that the people were laughing not at his (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) wit, but at the ridiculous
incongruity of the two voices--the gigantic feeble fife, and the petty
deep, loud drum, the mountain delivered of a squeak, and the mole-hill
belching thunder.

<p/>The singular duet came to as singular an end. Giles lost all patience
and self-command, and being a creature devoid of fear, and in a rage to
boot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) actually dropped upon the giant's neck, seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) hair with
one hand, and punched his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) head with the other. The giant's first impulse
was to laugh, but the weight and rapidity of the blows soon corrected
that inclination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)! Ah! ha! hallo! oh! oh! Holy saints! here! help! or I must
throttle the imp. I can't! I'll split your skull against the--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
made a wild run backwards at the balcony. Giles saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) danger, seized
the balcony in time with both hands, and whipped over it just as the
giant's head came against it with a stunning crack. The people roared
with laughter and exultation at the address of their little champion.
The indignant giant seized two of the laughers, knocked them together
like dumb-bells, shook them and strewed them flat--Catherine shrieked
and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) apron over Giles--then strode wrathfully away after the
party. This incident had consequences no one then present foresaw. Its
immediate results were agreeable. The Tergovians turned proud of Giles,
and listened with more affability to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) prayers for parchment. For
he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) drove a regular trade with his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) brother Gerard in this article. Went
about and begged it gratis, and Gerard gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) coppers for it.

<p/>On the afternoon of the same day, Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter were
chatting together about their favourite theme, Gerard, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) goodness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
benefice, and the brightened prospects of the whole family.

<p/>Their good luck had come to them in the very shape they would have
chosen; besides the advantages of a benefice such as the Countess
Charolois would not disdain to give, there was the feminine delight
at having a priest, a holy man, in their own family. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will marry
Cornelis and Sybrandt: for they can wed -LRB-good housewives-RRB-, now, if they
will. Gerard will take care of you and Giles, when we are gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother, and we can confess to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) instead of to a stranger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said
Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, girl! and he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) can give the sacred oil to your father and me, and
close our eyes when our time comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother! not for many, many years, I do pray Heaven. Pray speak not
of that, it always makes me sad. I hope to go before you, mother dear.
No; let us be gay to-day. I am out of pain, mother, quite out of
all pain; it does seem so strange; and I feel so bright and happy,
that--mother, Can you keep a secret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody better, child. Why, you know I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will show you something so beautiful. You never saw the like, I
trow. Only Gerard must never know; for sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) means to surprise us with
it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) covers it up so, and sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) carries it away altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate took her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) crutches, and moved slowly away, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mother in an
exalted state of curiosity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) soon returned with something in a cloth,
uncovered it, and there was a lovely picture of the Virgin, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
insignia, and wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) tiara over a wealth of beautiful hair, which
flowed loose over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) shoulders. Catherine, at first, was struck with
awe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``it is the Queen of Heaven. I never saw one
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) to my mind before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) eyes, mother: lifted to the sky, as if they belonged there, and
not to a mortal creature. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) beautiful hair of burning gold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to think I have a son that can make the saints live again upon a
piece of wood!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The reason is, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is a young saint himself, mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is too good for
this world; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is here to portray the blessed, and then to go away and
be with them for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Ere they had half done admiring it, a strange voice was heard at the
door. By one of the furtive instincts of their sex they hastily hid the
picture in the cloth, though there was no need, And the next moment in
came, casting his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes furtively around, a man that had not entered the
house this ten years Ghysbrecht Van Swieten.

<p/>The two women were so taken by surprise, that they merely stared at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) and at one another, and said, <div class="bookquote">``The burgomaster!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>in a tone so
expressive, that Ghysbrecht felt compelled to answer it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! I own the last time I came here was not on a friendly errand. Men
love their own interest--Eli's and mine were contrary. Well, let this
visit atone the last. To-day I come on your business and none of mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter exchanged a swift glance of contemptuous
incredulity. They knew the man better than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is about your son Gerard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! ay! you want him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to work for the town all for nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) told us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I come on no such errand. It is to let you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) has fallen into bad
hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now Heaven and the saints forbid! Man, torture not a mother! Speak out,
and quickly: speak ere you have time to coin falsehood: we know thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>Ghysbrecht turned pale at this affront, and spite mingled with the other
motives that brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here. <div class="bookquote">``Thus it is, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
teeth and speaking very fast. <div class="bookquote">``Your son Gerard is more like to be father
of a family than a priest: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is for ever with Margaret, Peter Brandt's
red-haired girl, and loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) like a cow her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) calf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mother and daughter both burst out laughing. Ghysbrecht stared at them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! you knew it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carry this tale to those who know not my son, Gerard. Women are nought
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Other women, mayhap. But this one is the apple of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eye to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), or
will be, if you part them not, and soon. Come, dame, make me not waste
time and friendly counsel: my servant has seen them together a score
times, handed, and reading babies in one another's eyes like--you know,
dame--you have been young, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Girl, I am ill at ease. Yea, I have been young, and know how blind
and foolish the young are. My heart! he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) has turned me sick in a moment.
Kate, if it should be true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>cried Kate eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Gerard might love a young woman: all
young men do: I can't find what they see in them to love so; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would let us know; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would not deceive us. You wicked man!
No, dear mother, look not so! Gerard is too good to love a creature of
earth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) love is for our Lady and the saints. Ah! I will show you the
picture there: if his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart was earthly, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) paint the Queen
of Heaven like that--look! look!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) held the picture out
triumphantly, and, more radiant and beautiful in this moment of
enthusiasm than ever dead picture was or will be, over-powered the
burgomaster with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) eloquence and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) feminine proof of Gerard's
purity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes and mouth opened, and remained open: in which state
they kept turning, face and all as if on a pivot, from the picture to
the women, and from the women to the picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it is herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>cried Kate, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hostility was softened. <div class="bookquote">``You admire it?
I forgive you for frightening us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I in a mad-house?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>said Ghysbrecht Van Swieten thoroughly puzzled.
<div class="bookquote">``You show me a picture of the girl; and you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) painted it; and that
is a proof he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cannot love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Why, they all paint their sweethearts,
painters do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A picture of the girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Kate, shocked. <div class="bookquote">``Fie! this is no girl;
this is our blessed Lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; it is Margaret Brandt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh blind! It is the Queen of Heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; only of Sevenbergen village.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Profane man! behold her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) crown!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silly child! look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) red hair! Would the Virgin be seen in red
hair? She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) who had the pick of all the colours ten thousand years before
the world began.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment an anxious face was insinuated round the edge of the open
door: it was their neighbour Peter Buyskens.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Buyskens</b></font>) in a cautious whisper. <div class="bookquote">``We can hear you all
across the street. What on earth is to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, neighbour! What is to do? Why, here is the burgomaster blackening
our Gerard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>cried Van Swieten. <div class="bookquote">``Peter Buyskens is come in the nick of time.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Buyskens</b></font>) knows father and daughter both. They cast their glamour on him (<font color='blue'><b>Buyskens</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! is she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a witch too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Else the egg takes not after the bird. Why is her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father called the

unholy spells on him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), and cured him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) of the colic: now, Peter, look and
tell me who is that? and you be silent, women, for a moment, if you can;
who is it, Peter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Buyskens</b></font>)</div>said Peter, in reply; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) eye seemed fascinated
by the picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated Ghysbrecht impetuously.

<p/>Peter Buyskens smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Why, you know as well as I do; but what have
they put a crown on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) for? I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in a crown, for my part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Man alive! Can't you open your great jaws, and just speak a wench's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd do a great deal more to oblige one of you than that, burgomaster.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Curse the man! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't--curse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what have I done now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said little Kate, <div class="bookquote">``for pity's sake tell us; are these the
features of a living woman, of--of--Margaret Brandt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A mirror is not truer, my little maid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is it she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), sir, for very certain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, who else should it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, why couldn't you say so at once?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>snarled Ghysbrecht.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did say so, as plain as I could speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Buyskens</b></font>)</div>snapped Peter; and they
growled over this small bone of contention so zealously, that they did
not see Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter had thrown their aprons over their
heads, and were rocking to and fro in deep distress. The next moment
Elias came in from the shop, and stood aghast. Catherine, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
face was covered, knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>) footstep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my poor man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sobbed. <div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), good Peter Buyskens, for I
have not the courage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elias</b></font>)</div><p/>Elias turned pale. The presence of the burgomaster in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>) house, after
so many years of coolness, coupled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>) wife's and daughter's
distress, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>) fear some heavy misfortune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Richart! Jacob!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Elias</b></font>) gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the burgomaster</b></font>)</div>said the burgomaster; <div class="bookquote">``it is nearer home, and nobody is dead
or dying, old friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the burgomaster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, burgomaster! Ah! something has gone off my breast that
was like to choke me. Now, what is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>Ghysbrecht then told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) told the women, and showed the
picture in evidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli, profoundly relieved. <div class="bookquote">``What are ye roaring and
bellowing for? It is vexing--it is angering, but it is not like death,
not even sickness. Boys will be boys. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will outgrow that disease: `tis
but skin-deep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>But when Ghysbrecht told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) that Margaret was a girl of good character;
that it was not to be supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would be so intimate if marriage had
not been spoken of between them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) brow darkened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marriage! that shall never be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) sternly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll stay that; ay,
by force, if need be--as I would his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand lifted to cut his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) throat. I'd
do what old John Koestein did t'other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is that, in Heaven's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>asked the mother, suddenly
removing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) apron.

<p/>It was the burgomaster who replied:

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) made me shut young Albert Koestein up in the prison of the
Stadthouse till he (<font color='blue'><b>Koestein</b></font>) knocked under. It was not long: forty-eight hours,
all alone, on bread and water, cooled his (<font color='blue'><b>Koestein</b></font>) hot stomach. `Tell my father I
am his (<font color='blue'><b>Koestein</b></font>) humble servant,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Koestein</b></font>), `and let me into the sun once more--the
sun is worth all the wenches in the world.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the cruelty of men!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>sighed Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that, the burgomaster has no choice: it is the law. And if a
father says, `Burgomaster, lock up my son,' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must do it. A fine thing
it would be if a father might not lock up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well! it won't come to that with me and my son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) never
disobeyed me in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) life: he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) never shall, Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)? It is past
supper-time. Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), Kate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! I know not, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>said Ghysbrecht; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is at Sevenbergen.

the road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>Supper passed in gloomy silence. Evening descended--no Gerard! Eight
o’clock came--no Gerard! Then the father sent all to bed, except
Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and I will walk abroad, wife, and talk over this new care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Abroad, my man, at this time? Whither?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, on the road to Sevenbergen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; no hasty words, father. Poor Gerard! he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) never vexed you before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fear me not. But it must end; and I am not one that trusts to-morrow
with to-day's work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The old pair walked hand in hand; for, strange is it may appear to
some of my readers, the use of the elbow to couples walking was not
discovered in Europe till centuries after this. They sauntered on a long
time in silence. The night was clear and balmy. Such nights, calm and
silent, recall the past from the dead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a many years since we walked so late, my man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine
softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sweetheart, more than we shall see again -LRB-is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never coming, I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not since our courting days, Eli.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been happy with me, my poor Eli?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you know I have. Friends I have known, but none like thee. Buss

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine trembled, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) husband's hand tight.

<p/>The moon was bright, but they were in the shadow of some trees, and
their son did not see them. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) came singing in the moonlight, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
face shining.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/>While the burgomaster was exposing Gerard at Tergou, Margaret had a
trouble of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own at Sevenbergen. It was a housewife's distress, but
deeper than we can well conceive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came to Martin Wittenhaagen, the
old soldier, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Martin, there's nothing in the house, and Gerard is coming, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is
so thoughtless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) forgets to sup at home. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gives over work, then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) runs to me straight, poor soul; and often he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) comes quite faint. And
to think I have nothing to set before my servant that loves me so dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``What can I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Thursday; it is your day to shoot; sooth to Say, I counted on you
to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>said the soldier, <div class="bookquote">``I may not shoot when the Duke or his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) friends
are at the chase; read else. I am no scholar.''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) took out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
pouch a parchment with a grand seal. It purported to be a stipend and a
licence given by Philip, Duke of Burgundy, to Martin Wittenhaagen, one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) archers, in return for services in the wars, and for a wound
received at the Dukes side. The stipend was four merks yearly, to be
paid by the Duke's almoner, and the licence was to shoot three arrows
once a week, viz., on Thursday, and no other day, in any of the Duke's
forests in Holland, at any game but a seven-year-old buck or a doe
carrying fawn; proviso, that the Duke should not be hunting on that day,
or any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) friends. In this case Martin was not to go and disturb the
woods on peril of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) salary and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) head, and a fine of a penny.

<p/>Margaret sighed and was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, cheer up, mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``for your sake I'll peril my
carcass; I have done that for many a one that was not worth your
forefinger. It is no such mighty risk either. I'll but step into the
skirts of the forest here. It is odds but they drive a hare or a fawn
within reach of my arrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if I let you go, you must promise me not to go far, and not to
be seen; far better Gerard went supperless than ill should come to you,
faithful Martin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>The required promise given, Martin took his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow and three arrows, and
stole cautiously into the wood: it was scarce a furlong distant. The
horns were heard faintly in the distance, and all the game was afoot.
<div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>thought Martin, <div class="bookquote">``I shall soon fill the pot, and no one be the
wiser.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) stand behind a thick oak that commanded a view of
an open glade, and strung his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow, a truly formidable weapon. It was
of English yew, six feet two inches high, and thick in proportion; and
Martin, broad-chested, with arms all iron and cord, and used to the bow
from infancy, could draw a three-foot arrow to the head, and, when
it flew, the eye could scarce follow it, and the bowstring twanged as
musical as a harp. This bow had laid many a stout soldier low in the
wars of the Hoecks and Cabbel-jaws. In those days a battlefield was not
a cloud of smoke; the combatants were few, but the deaths many--for they
saw what they were about; and fewer bloodless arrows flew than bloodless
bullets now. A hare came cantering, then sat sprightly, and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ears
made a capital V. Martin levelled his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) tremendous weapon at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). The
arrow flew, the string twanged; but Martin had been in a hurry to pot
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and lost her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) by an inch: the arrow seemed to hit her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), but it struck
the ground close to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and passed under her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) belly like a flash, and
hissed along the short grass and disappeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) jumped three feet
perpendicular and away at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) speed. <div class="bookquote">``Bungler!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin.
A sure proof he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was not an habitual bungler, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would have blamed
the hare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had scarcely fitted another arrow to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) string when a
wood-pigeon settled on the very tree he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) stood under. <div class="bookquote">``Aha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``you are small, but dainty.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) took more pains; drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) arrow
carefully, loosed it smoothly, and saw it, to all appearance, go clean
through the bird, carrying feathers skyward like dust. Instead of
falling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) feet, the bird, whose breast was torn, not fairly
pierced, fluttered feebly away, and, by a great effort, rose above the
trees, flew some fifty yards and dead at last; but where, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could not
see for the thick foliage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Luck is against me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) despondingly. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fitted another arrow,
and eyed the glade keenly. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) heard a bustle behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), and
turned round just in time to see a noble buck cross the open, but too
late to shoot at him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) dashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow down with an imprecation. At
that moment a long spotted animal glided swiftly across after the deer;
its belly seemed to touch the ground as it went. Martin took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow
hastily: he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) recognized the Duke's leopard. <div class="bookquote">``The hunters will not be far
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I must not be seen. Gerard must go supperless
this night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) plunged into the wood, following the buck and leopard, for that was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) way home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had not gone far when he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) heard an unusual sound ahead
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)--leaves rustling violently and the ground trampled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hurried in
the direction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) found the leopard on the buck's back, tearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
with teeth and claw, and the buck running in a circle and bounding
convulsively, with the blood pouring down his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hide. Then Martin formed a
desperate resolution to have the venison for Margaret. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) arrow
to the head, and buried it in the deer, who, spite of the creature on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) back, bounded high into the air, and fell dead. The leopard went on
tearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) as if nothing had happened.

<p/>Martin hoped that the creature would gorge itself with blood, and then
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) take the meat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) waited some minutes, then walked resolutely
up, and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hand on the buck's leg. The leopard gave a frightful
growl, and left off sucking blood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw Martin's game, and was
sulky and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) guard. What was to be done? Martin had heard that wild
creatures cannot stand the human eye. Accordingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) stood erect, and
fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) on the leopard: the leopard returned a savage glance, and
never took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eye off Martin. Then Martin continuing to look the beast
down, the leopard, brutally ignorant of natural history, flew at his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
head with a frightful yell, flaming eyes, and jaws and distended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had
but just time to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) by the throat, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) teeth could crush
his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) face; one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) claws seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) shoulder and rent it, the other,
aimed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) cheek, would have been more deadly still, but Martin was
old-fashioned, and wore no hat, but a scapulary of the same stuff as his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
jerkin, and this scapulary he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had brought over his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) head like a hood; the
brute's claw caught in the loose leather. Martin kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) teeth off his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
face with great difficulty, and griped her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) throat fiercely, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
kept rending his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) shoulder. It was like blunt reaping-hooks grinding and
tearing. The pain was fearful; but, instead of cowing the old soldier,
it put his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) blood up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) gnashed his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) teeth with rage almost as fierce
as hers, and squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) neck with iron force. The two pair of eyes
flared at one another--and now the man's were almost as furious as the
brute's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was throttling her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and made a wild attempt
to free herself, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cowl all over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face and
blinded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and tore her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) claw out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder, flesh and all; but
still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throttled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with hand and arm of iron. Presently her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
long tail, that was high in the air, went down. <div class="bookquote">``Aha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>cried Martin,
joyfully, and gripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) like death; next, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) body lost its
elasticity, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) held a choked and powerless thing: he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) gripped it
still, till all motion ceased, then dashed it to the earth; then,
panting, removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) cowl: the leopard lay mute at his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) feet with tongue
protruding and bloody paw; and for the first time terror fell on Martin.
<div class="bookquote">``I am a dead man: I have slain the Duke's leopard.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hastily seized
a few handfuls of leaves and threw them over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); then shouldered the
buck, and staggered away, leaving a trail of blood all the way his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) own
and the buck's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) burst into Peter's house a horrible figure, bleeding
and bloodstained, and flung the deer's carcass down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There--no questions,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but broil me a steak on't, for I am
faint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret did not see he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was wounded; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thought the blood was all from
the deer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) busied herself at the fire, and the stout soldier stanched and bound
his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) own wound apart; and soon he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) and Gerard and Margaret were supping
royally on broiled venison.

<p/>They were very merry; and Gerard, with wonderful thoughtfulness, had
brought a flask of Schiedam, and under its influence Martin revived,
and told them how the venison was got; and they all made merry over the
exploit.

<p/>Their mirth was strangely interrupted. Margaret's eye became fixed and
fascinated, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cheek pale with fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gasped, and could not
speak, but pointed to the window with trembling finger. Their eyes
followed hers, and there in the twilight crouched a dark form with eyes
like glowworms.

<p/>It was the leopard.

<p/>While they stood petrified, fascinated by the eyes of green fire, there
sounded in the wood a single deep bay. Martin trembled at it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), and laid muzzled bloodhounds on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) scent;
they will find her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) here, and the venison. Good-bye, friends, Martin
Wittenhaagen ends here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bow, and put it into the soldier's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``shoot her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), and fling her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) into the wood ere they
come up. Who will know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>More voices of hounds broke out, and nearer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Curse her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>cried Martin; <div class="bookquote">``I spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) once; now she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) must die, or I,
or both more likely;''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) reared his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow, and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) arrow to the
head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay! nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret, and seized the arrow. It broke in half: the
pieces fell on each side the bow. The air at the same time filled with
the tongues of the hounds: they were hot upon the scent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you done, wench? You have put the halter round my throat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``I have saved you: stand back from the window,
both! Your knife, quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) long-pointed knife, almost tore it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) girdle, and
darted from the room. The house was now surrounded with baying dogs and
shouting men.

<p/>The glowworm eyes moved not.



<p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>Margaret cut off a huge piece of venison, and ran to the window and
threw it out to the green eyes of fire. They darted on to it with a
savage snarl; and there was a sound of rending and crunching: at this
moment, a hound uttered a bay so near and loud it rang through the
house; and the three at the window shrank together. Then the leopard
feared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) supper, and glided swiftly and stealthily away with it
towards the woods, and the very next moment horses and men and dogs came
helter-skelter past the window, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) full cry. Martin and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) companions breathed again: the leopard was swift, and would not
be caught within a league of their house. They grasped hands. Margaret
seized this opportunity, and cried a little; Gerard kissed the tears
away.

<p/>To table once more, and Gerard drank to woman's wit: ```Tis stronger than
man's force,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``when those she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) loves are in danger; not else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>To-night Gerard stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) longer than usual, and went home prouder
than ever of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and happy as a prince. Some little distance from home,
under the shadow of some trees, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) encountered two figures: they almost
barred his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) way.

<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) father and mother.

<p/>Out so late! what could be the cause?

<p/>A chill fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) stopped and looked at them: they stood grim and silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) stammered
out some words of inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why ask?''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father; <div class="bookquote">``you know why we are here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gerard!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother, with a voice full of reproach yet of
affection.

<p/>Gerard's heart quaked: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was silent.

<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) father pitied his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) confusion, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, you need not to hang your head. You are not the first young fool
that has been caught by a red cheek and a pair of blue eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>put in Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``it was witchcraft; Peter the Magician is
well known for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Sir Priest,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``you know you must not meddle
with women folk. But give us your promise to go no more to Sevenbergen,
and here all ends: we won't be hard on you for one fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot promise that, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not promise it, you young hypocrite!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, father, miscall me not: I lacked courage to tell you what I knew
would vex you; and right grateful am I to that good friend, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
be, that has let you wot. `Tis a load off my mind. Yes, father, I love
Margaret; and call me not a priest, for a priest I will never be. I will
die sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we shall see, young man. Come, gainsay me no more; you will learn
what `tis to disrespect a father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard held his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) peace, and the three walked home in gloomy silence,
broken only by a deep sigh or two from Catherine.

<p/>From that hour the little house at Tergou was no longer the abode of
peace. Gerard was taken to task next day before the whole family; and
every voice was loud against him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), except little Kate's and the dwarf's,
who was apt to take his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) cue from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) without knowing why. As for
Cornelis and Sybrandt, they were bitterer than their father. Gerard
was dismayed at finding so many enemies, and looked wistfully into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
little sister's face: her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes were brimming at the harsh words showered
on one who but yesterday was the universal pet. But she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) no
encouragement: she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear Gerard, pray to Heaven to cure you of this folly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, are you against me too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, sadly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rose with a
deep sigh, and left the house and went to Sevenbergen.

<p/>The beginning of a quarrel, where the parties are bound by affection
though opposed in interest and sentiment, is comparatively innocent:
both are perhaps in the right at first starting, and then it is that
a calm, judicious friend, capable of seeing both sides, is a gift from
Heaven. For the longer the dissension endures, the wider and deeper it
grows by the fallibility and irascibility of human nature: these are
not confined to either side, and finally the invariable end is
reached--both in the wrong.

<p/>The combatants were unequally matched: Elias was angry, Cornelis and
Sybrandt spiteful; but Gerard, having a larger and more cultivated mind,
saw both sides where they saw but one, and had fits of irresolution,
and was not wroth, but unhappy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was lonely, too, in this struggle.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could open his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart to no one. Margaret was a high-spirited girl:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dared not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had to endure at home; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was capable of
siding with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) relations by resigning him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), though at the cost of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
own happiness. Margaret Van Eyck had been a great comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) on
another occasion; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dared not make her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) confidant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) own
history was well known. In early life she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) had many offers of marriage;
but refused them all for the sake of that art, to which a wife's and
mother's duties are so fatal: thus she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remained single and painted with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brothers. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) declined the benefice she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had got him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and declined it for the sake of that which at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) age she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had despised and sacrificed so lightly?

<p/>Gerard at this period bade fair to succumb. But the other side had a
horrible ally in Catherine, senior. This good-hearted but uneducated
woman could not, like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter, act quietly and firmly: still less
could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) act upon a plan. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) irritated Gerard at times, and so helped
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); for anger is a great sustainer of the courage: at others she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned
round in a moment and made onslaughts on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own forces. To take
a single instance out of many: one day that they were all at home,
Catherine and all, Cornelis said: <div class="bookquote">``Our Gerard wed Margaret Brandt? Why,
it is hunger marrying thirst.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cornelis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what will it be when you marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Gerard can
paint, Gerard can write, but what can you do to keep a woman, ye lazy
loon? Nought but wait for your father's shoon. Oh we can see why you and
Sybrandt would not have the poor boy to marry. You are afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will
come to us for a share of our substance. And say that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) does, and say
that we give it him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), it isn't yourn we part from, and mayhap never will
be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>On these occasions Gerard smiled slily, and picked up heart, and
temporary confusion fell on Catherine's unfortunate allies. But at last,
after more than six months of irritation, came the climax. The father
told the son before the whole family he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had ordered the burgomaster
to imprison him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in the Stadthouse rather than let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marry Margaret.
Gerard turned pale with anger at this, but by a great effort held his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
peace. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) father went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``And a priest you shall be before the
year is out, nilly-willy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Then, hear me, all. By God and St. Bavon I
swear I will never be a priest while Margaret lives. Since force is to
decide it, and not love and duty, try force, father; but force shall not
serve you, for the day I see the burgomaster come for me, I leave Tergou
for ever, and Holland too, and my father's house, where it seems I have
been valued all these years, not for myself, but for what is to be got
out of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) flung out of the room white with anger and desperation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``that comes of driving young folks too hard.
But men are crueller than tigers, even to their own flesh and blood.
Now, Heaven forbid he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should ever leave us, married or single.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>As Gerard came out of the house, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cheeks pale and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart panting,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) met Reicht Heynes: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had a message for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>): Margaret Van Eyck
desired to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found the old lady seated grim as a judge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>)
wasted no time in preliminaries, but inquired coldly why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had not
visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) of late: before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) said in a sarcastic
tone, <div class="bookquote">``I thought we had been friends, young sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At this Gerard looked the picture of doubt and consternation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is because you never told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) you were in love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht Heynes,
pitying his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) confusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence, wench! Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tell us his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) affairs? We are not his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
friends: we have not deserved his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) confidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! my second mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``I did not dare to tell you my
folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What folly? Is it folly to love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am told so every day of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not have been afraid to tell my mistress; she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is always kind
to true lovers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam--Reicht I was afraid because I was told...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you were told--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That in your youth you scorned love, preferring art.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did, boy; and what is the end of it? Behold me here a barren stock,
while the women of my youth have a troop of children at their side, and
grandchildren at their knee I gave up the sweet joys of wifehood and
motherhood for what? For my dear brothers. They have gone and left me
long ago. For my art. It has all but left me too. I have the knowledge
still, but what avails that when the hand trembles. No, Gerard; I look
on you as my son. You are good, you are handsome, you are a painter,
though not like some I have known. I will not let you throw your youth
away as I did mine: you shall marry this Margaret. I have inquired, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is a good daughter. Reicht here is a gossip. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) has told me all
about it. But that need not hinder you to tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Gerard was overjoyed to be permitted to praise Margaret aloud, and
to one who could understand what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) loved in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>Soon there were two pair of wet eyes over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) story; and when the poor
boy saw that, there were three.

<p/>Women are creatures brimful of courage. Theirs is not exactly the same
quality as manly courage; that would never do, hang it all; we should
have to give up trampling on them. No; it is a vicarious courage. They
never take part in a bull-fight by any chance; but it is remarked that
they sit at one unshaken by those tremors and apprehensions for the
combatants to which the male spectator--feeble-minded wretch!--is
subject. Nothing can exceed the resolution with which they have been
known to send forth men to battle: as some witty dog says,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Les femmes sont tres braves avec le peur d’autrui.''

 (<font color='red'><b>some dog</b></font>)</div><p/>By this trait Gerard now profited. Margaret and Reicht were agreed that
a man should always take the bull by the horns. Gerard's only course was
to marry Margaret Brandt off-hand; the old people would come to after
a while, the deed once done. Whereas, the longer this misunderstanding
continued on its present footing, the worse for all parties, especially
for Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See how pale and thin they have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Les</b></font>) amongst them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you are, Master Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht. ``It makes a body sad to
see a young man so wasted and worn. Mistress, when I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in the
street to-day, I had liked to have burst out crying: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was so changed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'll be bound the others keep their colour; ah, Reicht? such as it
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I see no odds in them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. We painters are no match for boors. We are glass, they
are stone. We can't stand the worry, worry, worry of little minds; and
it is not for the good of mankind we should be exposed to it. It is hard
enough, Heaven knows, to design and paint a masterpiece, without having
gnats and flies stinging us to death into the bargain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Exasperated as Gerard was by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) father's threat of violence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
listened to these friendly voices telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) the prudent course was
rebellion. But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) listened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was not convinced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not fear my father's violence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I do fear his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
anger. When it came to the point he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not imprison me. I would marry
Margaret to-morrow if that was my only fear. No; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would disown me. I
should take Margaret from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) a poor husband,
who would never thrive, weighed down by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) parent's curse. Madam! I
sometimes think if I could marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) secretly, and then take her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) away
to some country where my craft is better paid than in this; and after
a year or two, when the storm had blown over, you know, could come back
with money in my purse, and say, `My dear parents, we do not seek your
substance, we but ask you to love us once more as you used, and as we
have never ceased to love you'--but, alas! I shall be told these are the
dreams of an inexperienced young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady's eyes sparkled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no dream, but a piece of wonderful common-sense in a boy;
it remains to be seen whether you have spirit to carry out your own
thought. There is a country, Gerard, where certain fortune awaits you
at this moment. Here the arts freeze, but there they flourish, as they
never yet flourished in any age or land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Italy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``It is Italy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, Italy! where painters are honoured like princes, and scribes are
paid three hundred crowns for copying a single manuscript. Know you not
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) Holiness the Pope has written to every land for skilful scribes
to copy the hundreds of precious manuscripts that are pouring into that
favoured land from Constantinople, whence learning and learned men are
driven by the barbarian Turks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I know not that; but it has been the dream and hope of my life to
visit Italy, the queen of all the arts; oh, madam! But the journey, and
we are all so poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Find you the heart to go, I'll find the means. I know where to lay my
hand on ten golden angels: they will take you to Rome: and the girl with
you, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loves you as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They sat till midnight over this theme. And, after that day, Gerard
recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) spirits, and seemed to carry a secret talisman against all
the gibes and the harsh words that flew about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ears at home.

<p/>Besides the money she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) procured him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) for the journey, Margaret Van Eyck
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) money's worth. Said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you secrets that I
learned from masters that are gone from me, and have left no fellow

day they left the easel. The reason is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) did nothing blindly, in
a hurry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) trusted to no hireling to grind his (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) colours; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) did it
himself, or saw it done. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) panel was prepared and prepared again--I
will show you how--a year before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) colour on. Most of them are
quite content to have their work sucked up and lost, sooner than not
be in a hurry. Bad painters are always in a hurry. Above all, Gerard,
I warn you use but little oil, and never boil it: boiling it melts that
vegetable dross into its heart which it is our business to clear away;
for impure oil is death to colour. No; take your oil and pour it into
a bottle with water. In a day or two the water will turn muddy: that is
muck from the oil. Pour the dirty water carefully away and add fresh.
When that is poured away, you will fancy the oil is clear. You're
mistaken. Reicht, fetch me that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Reicht brought a glass trough with a
glass lid fitting tight. <div class="bookquote">``When your oil has been washed in bottle, put
it into this trough with water, and put the trough in the sun all day.
You will soon see the water turbid again. But mark, you must not carry
this game too far, or the sun will turn your oil to varnish. When it is
as clear as crystal, not too luscious, drain carefully, and cork it up
tight. Grind your own prime colours, and lay them on with this oil, and
they shall live. Hubert would put sand or salt in the water to clear the
oil quicker. But Jan used to say, `Water will do it best; give water
time.' Jan Van Eyck was never in a hurry, and that is why the world will
not forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) in a hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>This and several other receipts, quae nunc perscribere longum est,
Margaret gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) with sparkling eyes, and Gerard received them like
a legacy from Heaven, so interesting are some things that read
uninteresting. Thus provided with money and knowledge, Gerard decided to
marry and fly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wife to Italy. Nothing remained now but to inform
Margaret Brandt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) resolution, and to publish the banns as quietly
as possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went to Sevenbergen earlier than usual on both these
errands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) began with Margaret; told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) of the Dame Van Eyck's
goodness, and the resolution he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had come to at last, and invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
co-operation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) refused it plump.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Gerard; you and I have never spoken of your family, but when you
come to marriage--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) stopped, then began again. <div class="bookquote">``I do think your
father has no ill-will to me more than to another. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told Peter
Buyskens as much, and Peter told me. But so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is bent on your
being a priest -LRB-you ought have told me this instead of I you-RRB-, I could
not marry you, Gerard, dearly as I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard strove in vain to shake this resolution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found it very easy
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cry, but impossible to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) yield. Then Gerard was
impatient and unjust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``then you are on their side, and you will drive
me to be a priest, for this must end one way or another. My parents hate
me in earnest, but my lover only loves me in jest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And with this wild, bitter speech, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) flung away home again, and left
Margaret weeping.

<p/>When a man misbehaves, the effect is curious on a girl who loves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sincerely. It makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pity him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). This, to some of us males, seems
anything but logical. The fault is in our own eye; the logic is too
swift for us. The girl argues thus:--<div class="bookquote">``How unhappy, how vexed, how poor
he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) must be to misbehave! Poor thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret was full of this sweet womanly pity, when, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) great
surprise, scarce an hour and a half after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), Gerard came
running back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with the fragments of a picture in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand, and
panting with anger and grief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, Margaret! see! see! the wretches! Look at their spite! They have
cut your portrait to pieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret looked, and, sure enough, some malicious hand had cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
portrait into five pieces. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was a good girl, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was not ice; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
turned red to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) very forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who did it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I know not. I dared not ask; for I should hate the hand that did
it, ay, till my dying day. My poor Margaret! The butchers, the ruffians!
Six months' work cut out of my life, and nothing to show for it now.
See, they have hacked through your very face; the sweet face that every
one loves who knows it. Oh, heartless, merciless vipers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, panting. <div class="bookquote">``Since this is how they
treat you for my sake--Ye rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) of my portrait, do ye? Well, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
shall have the face itself, such as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Margaret!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Gerard; since they are so cruel, I will be the kinder: forgive
me for refusing you. I will be your wife: to-morrow, if it is your
pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands with rapture, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lips; and in a tumult
of joy ran for Peter and Martin. They came and witnessed the betrothal;
a solemn ceremony in those days, and indeed for more than a century
later, though now abolished.



<p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>The banns of marriage had to be read three times, as in our days; with
this difference, that they were commonly read on week-days, and the
young couple easily persuaded the cure to do the three readings in
twenty-four hours: he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was new to the place, and their looks spoke
volumes in their favour. They were cried on Monday at matins and at
vespers; and, to their great delight, nobody from Tergou was in the
church. The next morning they were both there, palpitating with anxiety,
when, to their horror, a stranger stood up and forbade the banns, On
the score that the parties were not of age, and their parents not
consenting.

<p/>Outside the church door Margaret and Gerard held a trembling, and almost
despairing consultation; but, before they could settle anything, the man
who had done them so ill a turn approached, and gave them to understand
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very sorry to interfere: that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inclination was to further
the happiness of the young; but that in point of fact his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only means of
getting a living was by forbidding banns: what then? <div class="bookquote">``The young people
give me a crown, and I undo my work handsomely; tell the cure I was
misinformed, and all goes smoothly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A crown! I will give you a golden angel to do this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard
eagerly; the man consented as eagerly, and went with Gerard to the cure,
and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had made a ridiculous mistake, which a sight of the
parties had rectified. On this the cure agreed to marry the young couple
next day at ten: and the professional obstructor of bliss went home with
Gerard's angel. Like most of these very clever knaves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was a fool,
and proceeded to drink his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) angel at a certain hostelry in Tergou where
was a green devoted to archery and the common sports of the day. There,
being drunk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bragged of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) day's exploit; and who should be
there, imbibing every word, but a great frequenter of the spot, the
ne’er-do-weel Sybrandt. Sybrandt ran home to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) father; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) father
was not at home; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was gone to Rotterdam to buy cloth of the merchants.
Catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) elder brother's eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a signal to come out, and
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had heard.

<p/>There are black sheep in nearly every large family; and these two were
Gerard's black brothers. Idleness is vitiating: waiting for the death of
those we ought to love is vitiating; and these two one-idea'd curs were
ready to tear any one to death that should interfere with that miserable
inheritance which was their thought by day and their dream by night.
Their parents' parsimony was a virtue; it was accompanied by industry,
and its motive was love of their offspring; but in these perverse and
selfish hearts that homely virtue was perverted into avarice, than which
no more fruitful source of crimes is to be found in nature.

<p/>They put their heads together, and agreed not to tell their mother,
whose sentiments were so uncertain, but to go first to the burgomaster.
They were cunning enough to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was averse to the match, though
they could not divine why.

<p/>Ghysbrecht Van Swieten saw through them at once; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) took care not
to let them see through him (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) heard their story, and putting on
magisterial dignity and coldness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) said;

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since the father of the family is not here, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) duty falleth on me, who
am the father of the town. I know your father's mind; leave all to me;
and, above all, tell not a woman a word of this, least of all the women
that are in your own house: for chattering tongues mar wisest counsels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) dismissed them, a little superciliously: he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) was ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>)
confederates.

<p/>On their return home they found their brother Gerard seated on a low
stool at their mother's knee: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was caressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hair with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand,
speaking very kindly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and promising to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) part with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
father and thwart his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) love no more. The main cause of this change of
mind was characteristic of the woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) it was who in a moment of
female irritation had cut Margaret's picture to pieces. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had watched
the effect with some misgivings, and had seen Gerard turn pale as death,
and sit motionless like a bereaved creature, with the pieces in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
hands, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes fixed on them till tears came and blinded them. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was terrified at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had done; and next her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heart smote her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
bitterly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wept sore apart; but, being what she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was, dared not
own it, but said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``I'll not say a word, but I'll make it up
to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bowels yearned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) son, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) feeble violence
died a natural death, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was transferring her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fatal alliance to
Gerard when the two black sheep came in. Gerard knew nothing of the
immediate cause; on the contrary, inexperienced as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was in the ins
and outs of females, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) kindness made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ashamed of a suspicion he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
had entertained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was the depredator, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) again
and again, and went to bed happy as a prince to think his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) mother was his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)
mother once more at the very crisis of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) fate.

<p/>The next morning, at ten o’clock, Gerard and Margaret were in the church
at Sevenbergen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) radiant with joy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with blushes. Peter was
also there, and Martin Wittenhaagen, but no other friend. Secrecy was
everything. Margaret had declined Italy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father;
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was too learned and too helpless. But it was settled they should
retire into Flanders for a few weeks until the storm should be blown
over at Tergou. The cure did not keep them waiting long, though it
seemed an age. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Flanders</b></font>) stood at the altar, and called them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Flanders</b></font>).
They went hand in hand, the happiest in Holland. The cure opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Flanders</b></font>)
book.

<p/>But ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Flanders</b></font>) uttered a single word of the sacred rite, a harsh voice cried
<div class="bookquote">``Forbear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And the constables of Tergou came up the aisle and seized
Gerard in the name of the law. Martin's long knife flashed out directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forbear, man!''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>cried the priest. <div class="bookquote">``What! draw your weapon in a church,
and ye who interrupt this holy sacrament, what means this impiety?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no impiety, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the burgomaster</b></font>)</div>said the burgomaster's servant
respectfully. <div class="bookquote">``This young man would marry against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's will, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father has prayed our burgomaster to deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) according to the
law. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deny it if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this so, young man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to Rotterdam to abide the sentence of the Duke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>At this Margaret uttered a cry of despair, and the young creatures, who
were so happy a moment ago, fell to sobbing in one another's arms so
piteously, that the instruments of oppression drew back a step and were
ashamed; but one of them that was good-natured stepped up under pretence
of separating them, and whispered to Margaret:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rotterdam? it is a lie. We but take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to our Stadthouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>They took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) away on horseback, on the road to Rotterdam; and, after a
dozen halts, and by sly detours, to Tergou. Just outside the town they
were met by a rude vehicle covered with canvas. Gerard was put into
this, and about five in the evening was secretly conveyed into the
prison of the Stadthouse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was taken up several flights of stairs
and thrust into a small room lighted only by a narrow window, with a
vertical iron bar. The whole furniture was a huge oak chest.

<p/>Imprisonment in that age was one of the highroads to death. It is
horrible in its mildest form; but in those days it implied cold,
unbroken solitude, torture, starvation, and often poison. Gerard felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
was in the hands of an enemy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the look that man gave me on the road to Rotterdam. There is more
here than my father's wrath. I doubt I shall see no more the light of
day.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) kneeled down and commended his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) soul to God.

<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rose and sprang at the iron bar of the window, and clutched
it. This enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to look out by pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees against the wall.
It was but for a minute; but in that minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw a sight such as none
but a captive can appreciate.

<p/>Martin Wittenhaagen's back.

<p/>Martin was sitting, quietly fishing in the brook near the Stadthouse.

<p/>Gerard sprang again at the window, and whistled. Martin instantly showed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was watching much harder than fishing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) turned hastily round
and saw Gerard--made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a signal, and taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) line and bow, went
quickly off.

<p/>Gerard saw by this that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friends were not idle: yet had rather Martin
had stayed. The very sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was a comfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) held on, looking
at the soldier's retiring form as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could, then falling back
somewhat heavily wrenched the rusty iron bar, held only by rusty nails,
away from the stone-work just as Ghysbrecht Van Swieten opened the door
stealthily behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>). The burgomaster's eye fell instantly on the iron,
and then glanced at the window; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) said nothing. The window was a
hundred feet from the ground; and if Gerard had a fancy for jumping out,
why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) balk it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) brought a brown loaf and a pitcher of water,
and set them on the chest in solemn silence. Gerard's first impulse
was to brain him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with the iron bar and fly down the stairs; but the
burgomaster seeing something wicked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eye, gave a little cough, and
three stout fellows, armed, showed themselves directly at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My orders are to keep you thus until you shall bind yourself by an oath
to leave Margaret Brandt, and return to the Church, to which you have
belonged from your cradle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Death sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>the burgomaster</b></font>)</div>And the burgomaster retired.

<p/>Martin went with all speed to Sevenbergen; there he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) found Margaret pale
and agitated, but full of resolution and energy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was just finishing
a letter to the Countess Charolois, appealing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) against the
violence and treachery of Ghysbrecht.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>cried Martin on entering. <div class="bookquote">``I have found him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is in the
haunted tower, right at the top of it. Ay, I know the place: many a poor
fellow has gone up there straight, and come down feet foremost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) then told them how he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had looked up and seen Gerard's face at a
window that was like a slit in the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Martin! how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) look?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What mean you? He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) looked like Gerard Eliassoen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But was he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) pale?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Looked he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) anxious? Looked he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) like one doomed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay; as bright as a pewter pot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mock me. Stay! then that must have been at sight of you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) counts
on us. Oh, what shall we do? Martin, good friend, take this at once to
Rotterdam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hand for the letter.

<p/>Peter had sat silent all this time, but pondering, and yet, contrary to
custom, keenly attentive to what was going on around him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put not your trust in princes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! what else have we to trust in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well-a-day, father! your learning will not serve us here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``How know you that? Wit has been too strong for iron bars ere to-day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, father; but nature is stronger than wit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is against us.
Think of the height! No ladder in Holland might reach him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I need no ladder; what I need is a gold crown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I have money, for that matter. I have nine angels. Gerard gave
them me to keep; but what do they avail? The burgomaster will not be
bribed to let Gerard free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do they avail? Give me but one crown, and the young man shall sup
with us this night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Buyskens</b></font>)</div><p/>Peter spoke so eagerly and confidently, that for a moment Margaret
felt hopeful; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) caught Martin's eye dwelling upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) with an
expression of benevolent contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It passes the powers of man's invention,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), with a deep sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Invention!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the old man. <div class="bookquote">``A fig for invention. What need we
invention at this time of day? Everything has been said that is to be
said, and done that ever will be done. I shall tell you how a Florentine
knight was shut up in a tower higher than Gerard's; yet did his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) faithful
squire stand at the tower foot and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) out, with no other engine
than that in your hand, Martin, and certain kickshaws I shall buy for a
crown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow, and turned it round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hand, and seemed to
interrogate it. But the examination left him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) as incredulous as before.

<p/>Then Peter told them his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) story, how the faithful squire got the knight
out of a high tower at Brescia. The manoeuvre, like most things that
are really scientific, was so simple, that now their wonder was they had
taken for impossible what was not even difficult.

<p/>The letter never went to Rotterdam. They trusted to Peter's learning and
their own dexterity.

<p/>It was nine o’clock on a clear moonlight night; Gerard, senior, was
still away; the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) little family had been some time abed.

<p/>A figure stood by the dwarf's bed. It was white, and the moonlight shone
on it.

<p/>With an unearthly noise, between a yell and a snarl, the gymnast rolled
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bed and under it by a single unbroken movement. A soft voice
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) retreat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Giles, are you afeard of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>At this, Giles's head peeped cautiously up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw it was only his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
sister Kate.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) finger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``Hush! lest the wicked Cornelis or the
wicked Sybrandt hear us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>Giles's claws seized the side of the bed, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) place by one undivided gymnastic.

<p/>Kate then revealed to Giles that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had heard Cornelis and Sybrandt
mention Gerard's name; and being herself in great anxiety at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) not
coming home all day, had listened at their door, and had made a fearful
discovery. Gerard was in prison, in the haunted tower of the Stadthouse.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was there, it seemed, by their father's authority. But here must be
some treachery; for how could their father have ordered this cruel act?
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was at Rotterdam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ended by entreating Giles to bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) company
to the foot of the haunted tower, to say a word of comfort to poor
Gerard, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) know their father was absent, and would be sure to
release him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Giles, I would go alone, but I am afeard of the spirits that men
say do haunt the tower; but with you I shall not be afeard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe there are any spirits in
Tergou. I never saw one. This last was the likest one ever I saw; and it
was but you, Kate, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>In less than half an hour Giles and Kate opened the housedoor cautiously
and issued forth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) carry a lantern, though the night was
bright. <div class="bookquote">``The lantern gives me more courage against the evil spirits,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).

<p/>The first day of imprisonment is very trying, especially if to the
horror of captivity is added the horror of utter solitude. I observe
that in our own day a great many persons commit suicide during the first
twenty-four hours of the solitary cell. This is doubtless why our Jairi
abstain so carefully from the impertinence of watching their little
experiment upon the human soul at that particular stage of it.

<p/>As the sun declined, Gerard's heart too sank and sank; with the waning
light even the embers of hope went out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was faint, too, with hunger;
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was afraid to eat the food Ghysbrecht had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>); and hunger
alone cows men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) sat upon the chest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) arms and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) head drooping
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>), a picture of despondency. Suddenly something struck the wall
beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) very sharply, and then rattled on the floor at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) feet. It
was an arrow; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) saw the white feather. A chill ran through him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>)--they
meant then to assassinate him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) from the outside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) crouched. No more
missiles came. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) crawled on all fours, and took up the arrow; there was
no head to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) uttered a cry of hope: had a friendly hand shot it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>)
took it up, and felt it all over: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) found a soft substance attached
to it. Then one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) eccentricities was of grand use to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>)
tinder-box enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) to strike a light: it showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) two things that
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) heart bound with delight, none the less thrilling for being
somewhat vague. Attached to the arrow was a skein of silk, and on the
arrow itself were words written.

<p/>How his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) eyes devoured them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) heart panting the while!

<p/>Well beloved, make fast the silk to thy knife and lower to us: but hold
thine end fast: then count an hundred and draw up.

<p/>Gerard seized the oak chest, and with almost superhuman energy dragged
it to the window: a moment ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could not have moved it. Standing on
the chest and looking down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw figures at the tower foot. They were
so indistinct, they looked like one huge form. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bonnet to
them with trembling hand: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) undid the silk rapidly but carefully,
and made one end fast to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knife and lowered it till it ceased to
draw. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) counted a hundred. Then pulled the silk carefully up: it
came up a little heavier. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came to a large knot, and by that
knot a stout whipcord was attached to the silk. What could this mean?
While he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was puzzling himself Margaret's voice came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), low but
clear. <div class="bookquote">``Draw up, Gerard, till you see liberty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>At the word Gerard drew
the whipcord line up, and drew and drew till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came to another knot,
and found a cord of some thickness take the place of the whipcord. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
had no sooner begun to draw this up, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had now a
heavy weight to deal with. Then the truth suddenly flashed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went to work and pulled and pulled till the perspiration rolled down
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>): the weight got heavier and heavier, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was well-nigh
exhausted: looking down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw in the moonlight a sight that revived
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>): it was as it were a great snake coming up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) out of the deep
shadow cast by the tower. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gave a shout of joy, and a score more wild
pulls, and lo! a stout new rope touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hauled and hauled,
and dragged the end into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) prison, and instantly passed it through
both handles of the chest in succession, and knotted it firmly; then sat
for a moment to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) breath and collect his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) courage. The
first thing was to make sure that the chest was sound, and capable of
resisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) weight poised in mid-air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) jumped with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) force
upon it. At the third jump the whole side burst open, and out scuttled
the contents, a host of parchments.

<p/>After the first start and misgiving this gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), Gerard comprehended
that the chest had not burst, but opened: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had doubtless jumped upon
some secret spring. Still it shook in some degree his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) confidence in the
chest's powers of resistance; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gave it an ally: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took the iron
bar and fastened it with the small rope across the large rope, and
across the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) now mounted the chest, and from the chest put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
foot through the window, and sat half in and half out, with one hand on
that part of the rope which was inside. In the silent night he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
own heart beat.

<p/>The free air breathed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) the courage to risk what
we must all lose one day--for liberty. Many dangers awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), but the
greatest was the first getting on to the rope outside. Gerard reflected.
Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) put himself in the attitude of a swimmer, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) body to the
waist being in the prison, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) legs outside. Then holding the inside
rope with both hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) felt anxiously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feet for the outside
rope, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had got it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) worked it in between the palms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
feet, and kept it there tight: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) uttered a short prayer, and, all
the calmer for it, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) left hand on the sill and gradually wriggled
out. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) seized the iron bar, and for one fearful moment hung
outside from it by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) right hand, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) left hand felt for the rope
down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees; it was too tight against the wall for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fingers to
get round it higher up. The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had fairly grasped it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) left the
bar, and swiftly seized the rope with the right hand too; but in this
manoeuvre his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) body necessarily fell about a yard. A stifled cry came up
from below. Gerard hung in mid-air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) teeth, and nipped
the rope tight with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feet and gripped it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands, and went
down slowly hand below hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) passed by one huge rough stone after
another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw there was green moss on one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked up and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked
down. The moon shone into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) prison window: it seemed very near. The
fluttering figures below seemed an awful distance. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dizzy to
look down: so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes steadily on the wall close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and
went slowly down, down, down.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) passed a rusty, slimy streak on the wall: it was some ten feet long.
The rope made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands very hot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stole another look up.

<p/>The prison window was a good way off now.

<p/>Down--down--down--down.

<p/>The rope made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands sore.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked up. The window was so distant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ventured now to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
eyes downward again; and there, not more than thirty feet below him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>),
were Margaret and Martin, their faithful hands upstretched to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could see their eyes and their teeth shine in the
moonlight. For their mouths were open, and they were breathing hard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, Gerard oh, take care! Look not down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fear me not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard joyfully, and eyed the wall, but came down
faster.

<p/>In another minute his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feet were at their hands. They seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
touched the ground, and all three clung together in one embrace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! away in silence, dear one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They stole along the shadow of the wall.

<p/>Now, ere they had gone many yards, suddenly a stream of light shot from
an angle of the building, and lay across their path like a barrier of
fire, and they heard whispers and footsteps close at hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Back!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>hissed Martin. <div class="bookquote">``Keep in the shade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They hurried back, passed the dangling rope, and made for a little
square projecting tower. They had barely rounded it when the light shot
trembling past them, and flickered uncertainly into the distance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A lantern!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>groaned Martin in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``They are after us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me my knife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>whispered Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``I'll never be taken alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>murmured Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``is there no way out where we are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None! none! But I carry six lives at my shoulder;''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>and with the word,
Martin strung his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow, and fitted an arrow to the string: <div class="bookquote">``in war never
wait to be struck: I will kill one or two ere they shall know where
their death comes from:''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>then, motioning his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) companions to be quiet he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
began to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow, and, ere the arrow was quite drawn to the head,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) glided round the corner ready to loose the string the moment the
enemy should offer a mark.

<p/>Gerard and Margaret held their breath in horrible expectation: they had
never seen a human being killed.

<p/>And now a wild hope, but half repressed, thrilled through Gerard, that
this watchful enemy might be the burgomaster in person. The soldier, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
knew, would send an arrow through a burgher or burgomaster, as he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) would
through a boar in a wood.

<p/>But who may foretell the future, however near? The bow, instead of
remaining firm, and loosing the deadly shaft, was seen to waver first,
then shake violently, and the stout soldier staggered back to them, his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
knees knocking and his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) cheeks blanched with fear. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) arrow fall,
and clutched Gerard's shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me feel flesh and blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``The haunted tower! the
haunted tower!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) terror communicated itself to Margaret and Gerard. They gasped
rather than uttered an inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``it will hear you up the wall! it is going up the
wall! Its head is on fire. Up the wall, as mortal creatures walk upon
green sward. If you know a prayer, say it, for hell is loose to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have power to exorcise spirits,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, trembling. <div class="bookquote">``I will
venture forth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go alone then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin; <div class="bookquote">``I have looked on't once, and live.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XI

<p/>The strange glance of hatred the burgomaster had cast on Gerard, coupled
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) imprisonment, had filled the young man with a persuasion that
Ghysbrecht was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) enemy to the death, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) glided round the angle of
the tower, fully expecting to see no supernatural appearance, but some
cruel and treacherous contrivance of a bad man to do him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a mischief in
that prison, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) escape from which could hardly be known.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stole forth, a soft but brave hand crept into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and Margaret
was by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side, to share this new peril.

<p/>No sooner was the haunted tower visible, than a sight struck their eyes
that benumbed them as they stood. More than halfway up the tower, a
creature with a fiery head, like an enormous glowworm, was steadily
mounting the wall: the body was dark, but its outline visible through
the glare from the head, and the whole creature not much less than four
feet long.

<p/>At the foot of the tower stood a thing in white, that looked exactly
like the figure of a female. Gerard and Margaret palpitated with awe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The rope! the rope! It is going up the rope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>gasped Gerard.

<p/>As they gazed, the glowworm disappeared in Gerard's late prison, but
its light illuminated the cell inside and reddened the window. The white
figure stood motionless below.

<p/>Such as can retain their senses after the first prostrating effect of
the supernatural are apt to experience terror in one of its strangest
forms, a wild desire to fling themselves upon the terrible object. It
fascinates them as the snake the bird. The great tragedian Macready
used to render this finely in Macbeth, at Banquo's second appearance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) flung himself with averted head at the horrible shadow. This strange
impulse now seized Margaret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) put down Gerard's hand quietly, and
stood bewildered; then, all in a moment, with a wild cry, darted towards
the spectre. Gerard, not aware of the natural impulse I have spoken of,
never doubted the evil one was drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) perdition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fell on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exorcizo vos. In nomine beatae Mariae, exorcizo vos.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the exorcist</b></font>)</div><p/>While the exorcist was shrieking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) incantations in extremity of
terror, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) infinite relief he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard the spectre utter a feeble
cry of fear. To find that hell had also its little weaknesses was
encouraging. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) redoubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) exorcisms, and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw the
ghastly shape kneeling at Margaret's knees, and heard it praying
piteously for mercy.


<p/>Kate and Giles soon reached the haunted tower. Judge their surprise when
they found a new rope dangling from the prisoner's window to the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see how it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the inferior intelligence, taking facts as they
came. <div class="bookquote">``Our Gerard has come down this rope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) has got clear. Up I go,
and see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Giles, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the superior intelligence, blinded by prejudice.
<div class="bookquote">``See you not this is glamour? This rope is a line the evil one casts out
to wile thee to destruction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) knows the weaknesses of all our hearts;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) has seen how fond you are of going up things. Where should our Gerard
procure a rope? how fasten it in the sky like this? It is not in nature.
Holy saints protect us this night, for hell is abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stuff!''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf way</b></font>)</div>said the dwarf; <div class="bookquote">``the way to hell is down, and this rope leads
up. I never had the luck to go up such a long rope. It may be years ere
I fall in with such a long rope all ready for me. As well be knocked on
the head at once as never know happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf way</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) sprung on to the rope with a cry of delight, as a cat jumps with
a mew on to a table where fish is. All the gymnast was on fire; and the
only concession Kate could gain from him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) was permission to fasten the
lantern on his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) neck first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A light scares the ill spirits,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).

<p/>And so, with his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) huge arms, and his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) legs like feathers, Giles went up
the rope faster than his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) brother came down it. The light at the nape of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) neck made a glowworm of him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) sister watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) progress, with
trembling anxiety. Suddenly a female figure started out of the solid
masonry, and came flying at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with more than mortal velocity.

<p/>Kate uttered a feeble cry. It was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) could, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) tongue clove to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) palate with terror. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) crutches, and sank upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
knees, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) face and moaning:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take my body, but spare my soul!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret -LRB-panting-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Why, it is a woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate -LRB-quivering-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Why, it is a woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``How you scared me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate. <div class="bookquote">``I am scared enough myself. Oh! oh! oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is strange! But the fiery-headed thing? Yet it was with you, and
you are harmless! But why are you here at this time of night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, why are YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps we are on the same errand? Ah! you are his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) good sister, Kate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are Margaret Brandt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the better. You love him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); you are here. Then Giles was right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
has won free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard came forward, and put the question at rest. But all further
explanation was cut short by a horrible unearthly noise, like a
sepulchre ventriloquizing:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``PARCHMENT!--PARCHMENT!--PARCHMENT!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At each repetition, it rose in intensity. They looked up, and there was
the dwarf, with his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) hands full of parchments, and his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) face lighted with
fiendish joy and lurid with diabolical fire. The light being at his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>)
neck, a more infernal <div class="bookquote">``transparency''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>never startled mortal eye. With the
word, the awful imp hurled parchment at the astonished heads below.
Down came records, like wounded wild-ducks; some collapsed, others
fluttering, and others spread out and wheeling slowly down in airy
circles. They had hardly settled, when again the sepulchral roar was
heard--<div class="bookquote">``Parchment--parchment!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and down pattered and sailed another
flock of documents: another followed: they whitened the grass. Finally,
the fire-headed imp, with his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) light body and horny hands, slid down the
rope like a falling star, and -LRB-business before sentiment-RRB- proposed to
his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) rescued brother an immediate settlement for the merchandise he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) had
just delivered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard; <div class="bookquote">``you speak too loud. Gather them up, and follow us
to a safer place than this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come home with me, Gerard?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said little Kate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You shall not say so. Who is more welcome than you will be, after this
cruel wrong, to your father's house?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father! I have no father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard sternly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) that was my father
is turned my gaoler. I have escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands; I will never come
within their reach again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An enemy did this, and not our father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had overheard Cornelis and Sybrandt say. But
the injury was too recent to be soothed. Gerard showed a bitterness of
indignation he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had hitherto seemed incapable of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cornelis and Sybrandt are two ill curs that have shown me their teeth
and their heart a long while; but they could do no more. My father it is
that gave the burgomaster authority, or he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) durst not have laid a finger
on me, that am a free burgher of this town. So be it, then. I was his (<font color='blue'><b>burgher</b></font>)
son. I am his (<font color='blue'><b>burgher</b></font>) prisoner. He (<font color='blue'><b>burgher</b></font>) has played his (<font color='blue'><b>burgher</b></font>) part. I shall play mine.
Farewell the burgh where I was born, and lived honestly and was put in
prison. While there is another town left in creation, I'll never trouble
you again, Tergou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Gerard! Gerard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Do not gainsay him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) now. Give his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) choler time to
cool!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate turned quickly towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Let me look at your face?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The
inspection was favourable, it seemed, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) whispered: <div class="bookquote">``It is a comely
face, and no mischief-maker's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fear me not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, in the same tone. <div class="bookquote">``I could not be happy
without your love, as well as Gerard's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are comfortable words,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>sobbed Kate. Then, looking up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``I little thought to like you so well. My heart is willing, but my
infirmity will not let me embrace you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At this hint, Margaret wound gently round Gerard's sister, and kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lovingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Often he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) has spoken of you to me, Kate; and often I longed for this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, too, Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate; <div class="bookquote">``kiss me ere you go; for my heart lies
heavy at parting with you this night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) went on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) crutches home. The last thing
they heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was a little patient sigh. Then the tears came and
stood thick in Margaret's eyes. But Gerard was a man, and noticed not
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sister's sigh.

<p/>As they turned to go to Sevenbergen, the dwarf nudged Gerard with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
bundle of parchments and held out a concave claw.

<p/>Margaret dissuaded Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Why take what is not ours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, spoil an enemy how you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But may they not make this a handle for fresh violence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can they? Think you I shall stay in Tergou after this? The
burgomaster robbed me of my liberty; I doubt I should take his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) life for
it, if I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, fie! Gerard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Is life worth more than liberty? Well, I can't take his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) life, so
I take the first thing that comes to hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gave Giles a few small coins, with which the urchin was gladdened,
and shuffled after his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sister. Margaret and Gerard were speedily joined
by Martin, and away to Sevenbergen.



<p/>CHAPTER XII

<p/>Ghysbrecht Van Swieten kept the key of Gerard's prison in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pouch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
waited till ten of the clock ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) visited for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``A
little hunger sometimes does well it breaks `em.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At ten he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) crept up
the stairs with a loaf and pitcher, followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) trusty servant well
armed. Ghysbrecht listened at the door. There was no sound inside.
A grim smile stole over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) features. <div class="bookquote">``By this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will be as
down-hearted as Albert Koestein was,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) opened the door.

<p/>No Gerard.

<p/>Ghysbrecht stood stupefied.

<p/>Although his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face was not visible, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) body seemed to lose all motion
in so peculiar a way, and then after a little he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fell trembling so, that
the servant behind him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) saw there was something amiss, and crept close
to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) and peeped over his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) shoulder. At sight of the empty cell, and
the rope, and iron bar, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) uttered a loud exclamation of wonder; but his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
surprise doubled when his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) master, disregarding all else, suddenly flung
himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knees before the empty chest, and felt wildly all over it
with quivering hands, as if unwilling to trust his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) eyes in a matter so
important.

<p/>The servant gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) in utter bewilderment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, master, what is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>Ghysbrecht's pale lips worked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) was going to answer; but they
uttered no sound: his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) hands fell by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) side, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) stared into the
chest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, master, what avails glaring into that empty box? The lad is not
there. See here! note the cunning of the young rogue; he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) hath taken out
the bar, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``GONE! GONE! GONE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone! What is gone, Holy saints! he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) is planet-struck!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``STOP THIEF!''  (<font color='red'><b>servant</b></font>)</div>shrieked Ghysbrecht, and suddenly turned, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) servant
and collared him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>), and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) with rage. <div class="bookquote">``D’ye stand there, knave, and
see your master robbed? Run! fly! A hundred crowns to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) that finds
it me again. No, no! `tis in vain. Oh, fool! fool! to leave that in the
same room with him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). But none ever found the secret spring before. None
ever would but he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). It was to be. It is to be. Lost! lost!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) years
and infirmity now gained the better of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) short-lived frenzy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>)
sank on the chest muttering <div class="bookquote">``Lost! lost!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is lost, master?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the servant kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``House and lands and good name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>groaned Ghysbrecht, and wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) hands
feebly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``WHAT?''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>cried the servant.

<p/>This emphatic word, and the tone of eager curiosity, struck on
Ghysbrecht's ear and revived his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) natural cunning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have lost the town records,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>stammered he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) looked askant at
the man like a fox caught near a hen-roost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, is that all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is't not enough? What will the burghers say to me? What will the burghs
do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) suddenly burst out again, <div class="bookquote">``A hundred crowns to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) who
shall recover them; all, mind, all that were in this box. If one be
missing, I give nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis a bargain, master: the hundred crowns are in my pouch. See you not
that where Gerard Eliassoen is, there are the pieces of sheepskin you
rate so high?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true; that is true, good Dierich: good faithful Dierich. All,
mind, all that were in the chest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Master, I will take the constables to Gerard's house, and seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) for
the theft.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The theft? ay! good; very good. It is theft. I forgot that. So, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
is a thief now, we will put him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in the dungeons below, where the toads
are and the rats. Dierich, that man must never see daylight again. `Tis
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own fault; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be prying. Quick, quick! ere he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has time to talk,
you know, time to talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div><p/>In less than half an hour Dierich Brower and four constables entered
the hosier's house, and demanded young Gerard of the panic-stricken
Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! what has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) done now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``that boy will break my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, dame, but a trick of youth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>said Dierich. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hath but made
off with certain skins of parchment, in a frolic doubtless but the
burgomaster is answerable to the burgh for their safe keeping, so he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is
in care about them; as for the youth, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will doubtless be quit for a
reprimand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>This smooth speech completely imposed on Catherine; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter
was more suspicious, and that suspicion was strengthened by the
disproportionate anger and disappointment Dierich showed the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>)
learned Gerard was not at home, had not been at home that night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come away then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) roughly. <div class="bookquote">``We are wasting time.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added
vehemently, <div class="bookquote">``I'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is above ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Affection sharpens the wits, and often it has made an innocent person
more than a match for the wily. As Dierich was going out, Kate made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>)
a signal she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) privately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) bade his (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) men go on, and
waited outside the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``my mother knows not. Gerard has left Tergou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>cried Dierich eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the foot of the haunted tower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) get the rope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know not; but this I know; my brother Gerard bade me there farewell,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is many leagues from Tergou ere this. The town, you know, was
always unworthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and when it imprisoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) vowed never
to set foot in it again. Let the burgomaster be content, then. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) has
imprisoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) has driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) birthplace and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
native land. What need now to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and us of our good name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div><p/>This might at another moment have struck Dierich as good sense; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>)
was too mortified at this escape of Gerard and the loss of a hundred
crowns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What need had he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to steal?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>retorted he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard stole not the trash; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) but took it to spite the burgomaster,
who stole his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) liberty; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shall answer to the Duke for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shall.
As for these skins of parchment you keep such a coil about, look in the
nearest brook or stye, and `tis odds but you find them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think ye so, mistress?--think ye so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>And Dierich's eyes flashed.
<div class="bookquote">``Mayhap you know `tis so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This I know, that Gerard is too good to steal, and too wise to load
himself with rubbish, going a journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give you good day, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>said Dierich sharply. <div class="bookquote">``The sheepskin you
scorn, I value it more than the skin of any in Tergou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) went off hastily on a false scent.

<p/>Kate returned into the house and drew Giles aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Giles, my heart misgives me; breathe not to a soul what I say to you. I
have told Dirk Brower that Gerard is out of Holland, but much I doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
is not a league from Tergou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where should he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) be, but with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) loves? But if so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) must not
loiter. These be deep and dark and wicked men that seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Giles, I
see that in Dirk Brower's eye makes me tremble. Oh, why cannot I fly to
Sevenbergen and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) away? Why am I not lusty and active like other
girls? God forgive me for fretting at His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will; but I never felt till
now what it is to be lame and weak and useless. But you are strong, dear
Giles,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) coaxingly; <div class="bookquote">``you are very strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am strong,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thundered Perpusillus; then, catching sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
meaning, <div class="bookquote">``but I hate to go on foot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) added sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! alas! who will help me if you will not? Dear Giles, do you not
love Gerard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) best of the lot. I'll go to Sevenbergen on Peter
Buyskens his (<font color='blue'><b>Buyskens</b></font>) mule. Ask you him (<font color='blue'><b>Buyskens</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Buyskens</b></font>) won't lend her (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate remonstrated. The whole town would follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>). It would be known
whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was gone, and Gerard be in worse danger than before.

<p/>Giles parried this by promising to ride out of the town the opposite
way, and not turn the mule's head towards Sevenbergen till he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had got
rid of the curious.

<p/>Kate then assented and borrowed the mule. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) charged Giles with a short
but meaning message, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) repeat it after her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) over and over,
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) could say it word for word.

<p/>Giles started on the mule, and little Kate retired, and did the last
thing now in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) power for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) beloved brother--prayed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) knees long
and earnestly for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) safety.



<p/>CHAPTER XIII

<p/>Gerard and Margaret went gaily to Sevenbergen in the first flush of
recovered liberty and successful adventure. But these soon yielded
to sadder thoughts. Gerard was an escaped prisoner, and liable to be
retaken and perhaps punished; and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and Margaret would have
to part for a time. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had conceived a hatred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) native
place. Margaret wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to leave the country for a while, but at
the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) going to Italy her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heart fainted. Gerard, on the
contrary, was reconciled to leaving Margaret only by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) desire to visit
Italy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) strong conviction that there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should earn money and
reputation, and remove every obstacle to their marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had already
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) all that the demoiselle Van Eyck had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) repeated
it, and reminded Margaret that the gold pieces were only given him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to go
to Italy with. The journey was clearly for Gerard's interest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was a
craftsman and an artist, lost in this boorish place. In Italy they would
know how to value him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). On this ground above all the unselfish girl gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) consent; but many tender tears came with it, and at that Gerard,
young and loving as herself, cried bitterly with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and often they
asked one another what they had done, that so many different persons
should be their enemies, and combine, as it seemed, to part them.

<p/>They sat hand in hand till midnight, now deploring their hard fate, now
drawing bright and hopeful pictures of the future, in the midst of which
Margaret's tears would suddenly flow, and then poor Gerard's eloquence
would die away in a sigh.

<p/>The morning found them resigned to part, but neither had the courage to
say when; and much I doubt whether the hour of parting ever would have
struck.

<p/>But about three in the afternoon, Giles, who had made a circuit of many
miles to avoid suspicion, rode up to the door. They both ran out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>),
eager with curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brother Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) tremendous tones, <div class="bookquote">``Kate bids you run
for your life. They charge you with theft; you have given them a handle.
Think not to explain. Hope not for justice in Tergou. The parchments you
took, they are but a blind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hath seen your death in the men's eyes;
a price is on your head. Fly! For Margaret's sake and all who love you,
loiter not life away, but fly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a thunder-clap, and left two white faces looking at one another,
and at the terrible messenger.

<p/>Then Giles, who had hitherto but uttered by rote what Catherine bade
him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), put in a word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the constables were at our house after you, and so was Dirk Brower.
Kate is wise, Gerard. Best give ear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) rede, and fly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret wildly. <div class="bookquote">``Fly on the instant. Ah! those
parchments; my mind misgave me: why did I let you take them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret, they are but a blind: Giles says so. No matter: the old
caitiff shall never see them again; I will not go till I have hidden
his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) treasure where he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) shall never find it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>Gerard then, after thanking
Giles warmly, bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) farewell, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to go back and tell Kate
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was gone. <div class="bookquote">``For I shall be gone ere you reach home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then
shouted for Martin; and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) what had happened, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to go
a little way towards Tergou, and watch the road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin, <div class="bookquote">``and if I see Dirk Brower or any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) men, I will
shoot an arrow into the oak-tree that is in our garden; and on that
you must run into the forest hard by, and meet me at the weird hunter's
spring. Then I will guide you through the wood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>Surprise thus provided against, Gerard breathed again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went with
Margaret, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) watched the oak-tree tremblingly, fearing every
moment to see an arrow strike among the branches, Gerard dug a deep hole
to bury the parchments in.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) threw them in, one by one. They were nearly all charters and records
of the burgh; but one appeared to be a private deed between Floris
Brandt, father of Peter, and Ghysbrecht.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, this is as much yours as his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``I will read this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not now, Gerard, not now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Every moment you lose
fills me with fear; and see, large drops of rain are beginning to fall,
and the clouds lower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard yielded to this remonstrance; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) put the deed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bosom,
and threw the earth in over the others, and stamped it down. While thus
employed there came a flash of lightning followed by a peal of distant
thunder, and the rain came down heavily. Margaret and Gerard ran into
the house, whither they were speedily followed by Martin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The road is clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and a heavy storm coming on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) words proved true. The thunder came nearer and nearer till it
crashed overhead: the flashes followed one another close, like the
strokes of a whip, and the rain fell in torrents. Margaret hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face
not to see the lightning. On this, Gerard put up the rough shutter and
lighted a candle. The lovers consulted together, and Gerard blessed
the storm that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a few hours more with Margaret. The sun set
unperceived, and still the thunder pealed, and the lightning flashed,
and the rain poured. Supper was set; but Gerard and Margaret could not
eat: the thought that this was the last time they should sup together
choked them. The storm lulled a little. Peter retired to rest. But
Gerard was to go at peep of day, and neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nor Margaret could
afford to lose an hour in sleep. Martin sat a while, too; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was
fitting a new string to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow, a matter in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was very nice.

<p/>The lovers murmured their sorrows and their love beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).

<p/>Suddenly the old man held up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to them to be silent.

<p/>They were quiet and listened, and heard nothing. But the next moment a
footstep crackled faintly upon the autumn leaves that lay strewn in the
garden at the back door of the house. To those who had nothing to fear
such a step would have said nothing; but to those who had enemies it was
terrible. For it was a foot trying to be noiseless.

<p/>Martin fitted an arrow to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) string and hastily blew out the candle. At
this moment, to their horror, they heard more than one footstep approach
the other door of the cottage, not quite so noiselessly as the other,
but very stealthily--and then a dead pause.

<p/>Their blood froze in their veins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Kate, oh, Kate! You said fly on the instant.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>And Margaret moaned
and wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands in anguish and terror and wild remorse for having
kept Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin, in a stern whisper.

<p/>A heavy knock fell on the door.

<p/>And on the hearts within.



<p/>CHAPTER XIV

<p/>As if this had been a concerted signal, the back door was struck as
rudely the next instant. They were hemmed in. But at these alarming
sounds Margaret seemed to recover some share of self-possession. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Say he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was here, but is gone.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And with this she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) seized
Gerard and almost dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) up the rude steps that led to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father's
sleeping-room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own lay next beyond it.

<p/>The blows on the door were repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who knocks at this hour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Open, and you will see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I open not to thieves--honest men are all abed now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Open to the law, Martin Wittenhaagen, or you shall rue it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that is Dirk Brower's voice, I trow. What make you so far from
Tergou?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Open, and you will know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin drew the bolt very slowly, and in rushed Dierich and four more.
They let in their companion who was at the back door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Martin, where is Gerard Eliassoen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard Eliassoen? Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) was here but now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>Dierich's countenance fell. <div class="bookquote">``And where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) has gone to Italy. Why, what is to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter. When did he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) go? Tell me not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) went in such a storm as
this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is a coil about Gerard Eliassoen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin contemptuously.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) lighted the candle, and seating himself coolly by the fire,
proceeded to whip some fine silk round his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow-string at the place where
the nick of the arrow frets it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``Know you his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) brother Giles?--a
little misbegotten imp, all head and arms? Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) came tearing over
here on a mule, and bawled out something, I was too far off to hear the
creature's words, but only its noise. Any way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) started Gerard. For as
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was gone, there was such crying and kissing, and then Gerard
went away. They do tell me he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) has gone to Italy--mayhap you know where
that is, for I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div><p/>Dierich's countenance fell lower and lower at this account. There was
no flaw in it, A cunninger man than Martin would perhaps have told a
lie too many and raised suspicion. But Martin did his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) task well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) only
told the one falsehood he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was bade to tell, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) own head invented
nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mates,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>said Dierich, <div class="bookquote">``I doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) speaks sooth. I told the burgomaster
how `twould be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) met the dwarf galloping Peter Buyskens's mule from
Sevenbergen. `They have sent that imp to Gerard,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), `so, then,
Gerard is at Sevenbergen.' `Ah, master!' says I, `'tis too late now. We
should have thought of Sevenbergen before, instead of wasting our time
hunting all the odd corners of Tergou for those cursed parchments that
we shall never find till we find the man that took `em. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at
Sevenbergen,' quoth I, `and they sent the dwarf to him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>), it must have
been to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) we are after him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) is leagues away by now,' quoth I.
Confound that chalk-faced girl! she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has outwitted us bearded men; and
so I told the burgomaster, but he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) would not hear reason. A wet jerkin
apiece, that is all we shall get, mates, by this job.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin grinned coolly in Dierich's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>added the latter, <div class="bookquote">``to content the burgomaster, we will search
the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin turned grave directly.

<p/>This change of countenance did not escape Dierich. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) reflected a
moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Watch outside two of you, one on each side of the house, that no one
jump from the upper windows. The rest come with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) took the candle and mounted the stairs, followed by three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>)
comrades.

<p/>Martin was left alone.

<p/>The stout soldier hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) head. All had gone so well at first; and now
this fatal turn! Suddenly it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) that all was not yet lost.
Gerard must be either in Peter's room or Margaret's; they were not so
very high from the ground. Gerard would leap out. Dierich had left a man
below; but what then? For half a minute Gerard and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would be two to
one, and in that brief space, what might not be done?

<p/>Martin then held the back door ajar and watched. The light shone in
Peter's room. <div class="bookquote">``Curse the fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) going to let them take
him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) like a girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The light now passed into Margaret's bedroom. Still no window was
opened. Had Gerard intended to escape that way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would not have waited
till the men were in the room. Martin saw that at once, and left the
door, and came to the foot-stair and listened.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) began to think Gerard must have escaped by the window while all the
men were in the house. The longer the silence continued, the stronger
grew this conviction. But it was suddenly and rudely dissipated.

<p/>Faint cries issued from the inner bedroom--Margaret's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>groaned Martin; <div class="bookquote">``they have got him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>It now flashed across Martin's mind that if they took Gerard away, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
life was not worth a button; and that, if evil befell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), Margaret's
heart would break. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes wildly round like some savage beast
seeking an escape, and in a twinkling formed a resolution terribly
characteristic of those iron times and of a soldier driven to bay. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
stepped to each door in turn, and imitating Dierich Brower's voice,
said sharply, <div class="bookquote">``Watch the window!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) then quietly closed and bolted
both doors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) then took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) bow and six arrows; one he (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) fitted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>)
string, the others he (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) quiver. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) knife he (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) placed upon a
chair behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>), the hilt towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>); and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) waited at the foot
of the stair with the calm determination to slay those four men, or be
slain by them. Two, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) could dispose of by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) arrows, ere
they could get near him (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>), and Gerard and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) must take their chance
hand-to-hand with the remaining pair. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had seen men
panic-stricken by a sudden attack of this sort. Should Brower and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>)
men hesitate but an instant before closing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) should shoot
three instead of two, and then the odds would be on the right side.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) had not long to wait. The heavy steps sounded in Margaret's room, and
came nearer and nearer.

<p/>The light also approached, and voices.

<p/>Martin's heart, stout as it was, beat hard, to hear men coming thus to
their death, and perhaps to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); more likely so than not: for four is
long odds in a battlefield of ten feet square, and Gerard might be bound
perhaps, and powerless to help. But this man, whom we have seen shake in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoes at a Giles-o'-lanthorn, never wavered in this awful moment of
real danger, but stood there, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body all braced for combat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eye glowing, equally ready to take life and lose it. Desperate game! to
win which was exile instant and for life, and to lose it was to die that
moment upon that floor he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood on.


<p/>Dierich Brower and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) men found Peter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) first sleep. They opened
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) cupboards, they ran their knives into an alligator he (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) had nailed to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) wall; they looked under his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) bed: it was a large room, and apparently
full of hiding-places, but they found no Gerard.

<p/>Then they went on to Margaret's room, and the very sight of it was
discouraging--it was small and bare, and not a cupboard in it; there
was, however, a large fireplace and chimney. Dierich's eye fell on these
directly. Here they found the beauty of Sevenbergen sleeping on an old
chest not a foot high, and no attempt made to cover it; but the sheets
were snowy white, and so was Margaret's own linen. And there she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lay,
looking like a lily fallen into a rut.

<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) awoke, and sat up in the bed, like one amazed; then,
seeing the men, began to scream faintly, and pray for mercy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) made Dierich Brower ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) errand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is a to-do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>), a little confused. <div class="bookquote">``We are not going to hurt
you, my pretty maid. Lie you still, and shut your eyes, and think of
your wedding-night, while I look up this chimney to see if Master Gerard
is there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard! in my room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? They say that you and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cruel! you know they have driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) away from me--driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
native place. This is a blind. You are thieves; you are wicked men; you
are not men of Sevenbergen, or you would know Margaret Brandt better
than to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) lover in this room of all others in the world. Oh,
brave! Four great hulking men to come, armed to the teeth, to insult one
poor honest girl! The women that live in your own houses must be naught,
or you would respect them too much to insult a girl of good character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There! come away, before we hear worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>said Dierich hastily. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
is not in the chimney. Plaster will mend what a cudgel breaks; but a
woman's tongue is a double-edged dagger, and a girl is a woman with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
mother's milk still in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) beat a hasty retreat. <div class="bookquote">``I told the
burgomaster how `twould be.''



 (<font color='red'><b>CHAPTER XV</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XV

<p/>Where is the woman that cannot act a part? Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who will not
do it, and do it well, to save the man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loves? Nature on these great
occasions comes to the aid of the simplest of the sex, and teaches her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
to throw dust in Solomon's eyes. The men had no sooner retired than
Margaret stepped out of bed, and opened the long chest on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
been lying down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) skirt and petticoat and stockings, and nightdress
over all; and put the lid, bed-clothes and all, against the wall: then
glided to the door and listened. The footsteps died away through her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
father's room and down the stairs.

<p/>Now in that chest there was a peculiarity that it was almost impossible
for a stranger to detect. A part of the boarding of the room had been
broken, and Gerard being applied to to make it look neater, and being
short of materials, had ingeniously sawed away a space sufficient just
to admit Margaret's soi-disant bed, and with the materials thus acquired
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had repaired the whole room. As for the bed or chest, it really
rested on the rafters a foot below the boards. Consequently it was full
two feet deep, though it looked scarce one.

<p/>All was quiet. Margaret kneeled and gave thanks to Heaven. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
glided from the door and leaned over the chest, and whispered tenderly,
<div class="bookquote">``Gerard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard did not reply.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) then whispered a little louder, <div class="bookquote">``Gerard, all is safe, thank Heaven!
You may rise; but oh! be cautious!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard made no reply.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shoulder--<div class="bookquote">``Gerard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>No reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands ran wildly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bosom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) by the shoulders; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lifted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) escaped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) trembling hands, and fell back, not like a
man, but like a body. A great dread fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). The lid had been down.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had lain upon it. The men had been some time in the room. With all
the strength of frenzy she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tore him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the chest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bore him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms to the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dashed the window open. The sweet air came
in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) laid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in it and in the moonlight. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was the colour of
ashes; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body was all limp and motionless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart. Horror!
it was as still as the rest! Horror of horrors! she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had stifled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own body.

<p/>The mind cannot all at once believe so great and sudden and strange a
calamity. Gerard, who had got alive into that chest scarce five minutes
ago, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) be dead?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) by all the endearing names that heart could think or
tongue could frame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and fondled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and coaxed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and
implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>No answer to words of love, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had never uttered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) before,
nor thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could utter. Then the poor creature, trembling all over,
began to say over that ashy face little foolish things that were at once
terrible and pitiable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gerard! I am very sorry you are dead. I am very sorry I have killed
you. Forgive me for not letting the men take you; it would have been
better than this. Oh, Gerard! I am very, very sorry for what I have
done.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) began suddenly to rave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! no! such things can't be, or there is no God. It is monstrous. How
can my Gerard be dead? How can I have killed my Gerard? I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Oh,
God! you know how I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) does not. I never told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knew
my heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would speak to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would not be so deaf to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) poor
Margaret. It is all a trick to make me cry out and betray him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); but no!
I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) too well for that. I'll choke first.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own
throat, to check her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wild desire to scream in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) terror and anguish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would but say one word. Oh, Gerard! don't die without a word.
Have mercy on me and scold me, but speak to me: if you are angry with
me, scold me! curse me! I deserve it: the idiot that killed the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
loved better than herself. Ah I am a murderess. The worst in all the
world. Help! help! I have murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tore her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hair, and uttered shriek after shriek, so wild, so
piercing, they fell like a knell upon the ears of Dierich Brower and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>)
men. All started to their feet and looked at one another.



<p/>CHAPTER XVI

<p/>Martin Wittenhaagen, standing at the foot of the stairs with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) arrow
drawn nearly to the head and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) knife behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>), was struck with
amazement to see the men come back without Gerard: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bow
and looked open-mouthed at them. They, for their part, were equally
puzzled at the attitude they had caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, mates, was the old fellow making ready to shoot at us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stuff!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) stolid composure; <div class="bookquote">``I was but trying
my new string. There! I'll unstring my bow, if you think that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>said Dierich suspiciously, <div class="bookquote">``there is something more in you than
I understand: put a log on, and let us dry our hides a bit ere we go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div><p/>A blazing fire was soon made, and the men gathered round it, and their
clothes and long hair were soon smoking from the cheerful blaze. Then it
was that the shrieks were heard in Margaret's room. They all started up,
and one of them seized the candle and ran up the steps that led to the
bedrooms.

<p/>Martin rose hastily too, and being confused by these sudden screams, and
apprehending danger from the man's curiosity, tried to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from
going there.

<p/>At this Dierich threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) from behind, and called on the
others to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>). The man that had the candle got clear away, and all
the rest fell upon Martin, and after a long and fierce struggle, in the
course of which they were more than once all rolling on the floor, with
Martin in the middle, they succeeded in mastering the old Samson, and
binding him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) hand and foot with a rope they had brought for Gerard.

<p/>Martin groaned aloud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) saw the man had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) way to Margaret's room
during the struggle, and here was he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) powerless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, grind your teeth, you old rogue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>said Dierich, panting with the
struggle. <div class="bookquote">``You shan't use them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my belief, mates, that our lives were scarce safe while this old
fellow's bones were free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) makes me think this Gerard is not far off,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>put in another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No such luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>replied Dierich. <div class="bookquote">``Hallo, mates. Jorian Ketel is a long
time in that girl's bedroom. Best go and see after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), some of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The rude laugh caused by this remark had hardly subsided, when hasty
footsteps were heard running along over head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) comes, at last. Well, Jorian, what is to do now up there?''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVII

<p/>Jorian Ketel went straight to Margaret's room, and there, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>)
infinite surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) found the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) had been in search of, pale and
motionless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) head in Margaret's lap, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) kneeling over him (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>), mute
now, and stricken to stone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes were dilated yet glazed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
neither saw the light nor heard the man, nor cared for anything on
earth, but the white face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lap.

<p/>Jorian stood awe-struck, the candle shaking in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), then, all the time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret heeded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not. Jorian went to the empty chest and inspected
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to comprehend. The girl's dumb and frozen despair moved
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a sorry sight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it is a black night's work: all for
a few skins! Better have gone with us than so. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is past answering me,
poor wench. Stop! let us try whether--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took down a little round mirror, no bigger than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and put it
to Gerard's mouth and nostrils, and held it there. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) withdrew it,
it was dull.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THERE IS LIFE IN HIM!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>said Jorian Ketel to himself.

<p/>Margaret caught the words instantly, though only muttered, and it was if
a statue should start into life and passion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) rose and flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms
round Jorian's neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bless the tongue that tells me so!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) clasped the great rough
fellow again and again, eagerly, almost fiercely.

<p/>``There, there! let us lay him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) warm, said Jorian; and in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
raised Gerard and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) on the bed-clothes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took out a flask
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) carried, and filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand twice with Schiedamze, and flung it
sharply each time in Gerard's face. The pungent liquor co-operated with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) recovery--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gave a faint sigh. Oh, never was sound so joyful to
human ear! She (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) flew towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), but then stopped, quivering for fear
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had lost all confidence in herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is right--let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>said Jorian; <div class="bookquote">``don't go cuddling him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) as
you did me, or you'll drive his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) breath back again. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) alone: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is
sure to come to. `Tisn't like as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was an old man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard sighed deeply, and a faint streak of colour stole to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lips.
Jorian made for the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had hardly reached it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
legs seized from behind.

<p/>It was Margaret! She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) curled round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees like a serpent, and kissed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand, and fawned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You won't tell? You have saved his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) life;
you have not the heart to thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) grave, to undo your
own good work?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! It is not the first time I have done you two a good turn; `twas
I told you in the church whither we had to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Besides, what is
Dierich Brower to me? I'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) hanged ere I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>). But I
wish you'd tell me where the parchments are! There are a hundred crowns
offered for them. That would be a good windfall for my Joan and the
children, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ah! they shall have those hundred crowns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! are the things in the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>asked Jorian eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I know where they are; and by God and St. Bavon I swear you
shall have them to-morrow. Come to me for them when you will, but come
alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I were made else. What! share the hundred crowns with Dirk Brower? And
now may my bones rot in my skin if I let a soul know the poor boy is
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then ran off, lest by staying longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should excite suspicion,
and have them all after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). And Margaret knelt, quivering from head to
foot, and prayed beside Gerard and for Gerard.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>replied Jorian to Dierich Brower's query; <div class="bookquote">``why, we have
scared the girl out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wits. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was in a kind of fit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We had better all go and doctor her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! and frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into the churchyard. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father is a doctor,
and I have roused him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and set him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) round. Let us see the
fire, will ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) off-hand way disarmed all suspicion. And soon after the party agreed
that the kitchen of the <div class="bookquote">``Three Kings''  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>was much warmer than Peter's
house, and they departed, having first untied Martin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take note, mate, that I was right, and the burgomaster wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>said
Dierich Brower at the door; <div class="bookquote">``I said we should be too late to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>),
and we were too late.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus Gerard, in one terrible night, grazed the prison and the grave.

<p/>And how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) get clear at last? Not by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cunningly contrived
hiding-place, nor by Margaret's ready wit; but by a good impulse in
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) captors, by the bit of humanity left in a somewhat reckless
fellow's heart, aided by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) desire of gain. So mixed and seemingly
incongruous are human motives, so shortsighted our shrewdest counsels.

<p/>They whose moderate natures or gentle fates keep them, in life's
passage, from the fierce extremes of joy and anguish our nature is
capable of, are perhaps the best, and certainly the happiest of
mankind. But to such readers I should try in vain to convey what bliss
unspeakable settled now upon these persecuted lovers, Even to those who
have joyed greatly and greatly suffered, my feeble art can present but a
pale reflection of Margaret's and Gerard's ecstasy.

<p/>To sit and see a beloved face come back from the grave to the world, to
health and beauty, by swift gradations; to see the roses return to the
loved cheek, love's glance to the loved eye, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) words to the loved
mouth--this was Margaret's--a joy to balance years of sorrow. It
was Gerard's to awake from a trance, and find his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head pillowed on
Margaret's arm; to hear the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) adored murmur new words of eloquent
love, and shower tears and tender kisses and caresses on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) never
knew, till this sweet moment, how ardently, how tenderly, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thanked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) enemies. They wreathed their arms sweetly round each
other, and trouble and danger seemed a world, an age behind them. They
called each other husband and wife. Were they not solemnly betrothed?
And had they not stood before the altar together? Was not the blessing
of Holy Church upon their union?--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) curse on all who would part them?

<p/>But as no woman's nerves can bear with impunity so terrible a strain.
presently Margaret turned faint, and sank on Gerard's shoulder, smiling
feebly, but quite, quite unstrung. Then Gerard was anxious, and would
seek assistance. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with a gentle grasp, and implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
not to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``While I can lay my hand on you, I feel you are safe, not else. Foolish
Gerard! nothing ails me. I am weak, dearest, but happy, oh! so happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Then it was Gerard's turn to support that dear head, with its great
waves of hair flowing loose over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), and soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>),
quivering on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bosom, with soft encouraging words and murmurs of love,
and gentle caresses. Sweetest of all her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) charms is a woman's weakness to
a manly heart.

<p/>Poor things! they were happy. To-morrow they must part. But that was
nothing to them now. They had seen Death, and all other troubles seemed
light as air. While there is life there is hope; while there is hope
there is joy. Separation for a year or two, what was it to them, who
were so young, and had caught a glimpse of the grave? The future was
bright, the present was Heaven: so passed the blissful hours.

<p/>Alas! their innocence ran other risks besides the prison and the grave.
They were in most danger from their own hearts and their inexperience,
now that visible danger there was none.



<p/>CHAPTER XVIII

<p/>Ghysbrecht Van Swieten could not sleep all night for anxiety. He (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) was
afraid of thunder and lightning, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) would have made one of the party
that searched Peter's house. As soon as the storm ceased altogether,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) crept downstairs, saddled his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mule, and rode to the <div class="bookquote">``Three Kings''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at
Sevenbergen. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) men sleeping, some on the chairs, some
on the tables, some on the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) roused them furiously, and heard
the story of their unsuccessful search, interlarded with praises of
their zeal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fool! to let you go without me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the burgomaster</b></font>)</div>cried the burgomaster. <div class="bookquote">``My life on't
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>) was there all the time. Looked ye under the girl's bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; there was no room for a man there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How know ye that, if ye looked not?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>snarled Ghysbrecht. <div class="bookquote">``Ye should
have looked under her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bed, and in it too, and sounded all the panels
with your knives. Come, now, get up, and I shall show ye how to search.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div><p/>Dierich Brower got up and shook himself. <div class="bookquote">``If you find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), call me a
horse and no man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Buyskens</b></font>)</div><p/>In a few minutes Peter's house was again surrounded.

<p/>The fiery old man left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mule in the hands of Jorian Ketel, and, with
Dierich Brower and the others, entered the house.

<p/>The house was empty.

<p/>Not a creature to be seen, not even Peter. They went upstairs, and
then suddenly one of the men gave a shout, and pointed through Peter's
window, which was open. The others looked, and there, at some little
distance, walking quietly across the fields with Margaret and Martin,
was the man they sought. Ghysbrecht, with an exulting yell, descended
the stairs and flung himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mule; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) men set off in
hot pursuit.



<p/>CHAPTER XIX

<p/>Gerard warned by recent peril, rose before daybreak and waked Martin.
The old soldier was astonished. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) thought Gerard had escaped by the
window last night. Being consulted as to the best way for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to leave
the country and elude pursuit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said there was but one road safe. <div class="bookquote">``I
must guide you through the great forest to a bridle-road I know of. This
will take you speedily to a hostelry, where they will lend you a swift
horse; and then a day's gallop will take you out of Holland. But let us
start ere the folk here quit their beds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Buyskens</b></font>)</div><p/>Peter's house was but a furlong and a half from the forest. They
started, Martin with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow and three arrows, for it was Thursday;
Gerard with nothing but a stout oak staff Peter gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) for the
journey.

<p/>Margaret pinned up her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) kirtle and farthingale, for the road was wet.
Peter went as far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) garden hedge with them, and then with more
emotion than he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) often bestowed on passing events, gave the young man his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
blessing.

<p/>The sun was peeping above the horizon as they crossed the stony field
and made for the wood. They had crossed about half, when Margaret, who
kept nervously looking back every now and then, uttered a cry, and,
following her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) instinct, began to run towards the wood, screaming with
terror all the way.

<p/>Ghysbrecht and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) men were in hot pursuit.

<p/>Resistance would have been madness. Martin and Gerard followed
Margaret's example. The pursuers gained slightly on them; but Martin
kept shouting, <div class="bookquote">``Only win the wood! only win the wood!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>They had too good a start for the men on foot, and their hearts bounded
with hope at Martin's words, for the great trees seemed now to stretch
their branches like friendly arms towards them, and their leaves like a
screen.

<p/>But an unforeseen danger attacked them. The fiery old burgomaster flung
himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) mule, and, spurring him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to a gallop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) headed not his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
own men only, but the fugitives. His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) object was to cut them off. The
old man came galloping in a semicircle, and got on the edge of the wood,
right in front of Gerard; the others might escape for aught he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cared.

<p/>Margaret shrieked, and tried to protect Gerard by clasping him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) off without ceremony.

<p/>Ghysbrecht in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ardour forgot that hunted animals turn on the hunter;
and that two men can hate, and two can long to kill the thing they hate.

<p/>Instead of attempting to dodge him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), as the burgomaster made sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
would, Gerard flew right at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), with a savage, exulting cry, and struck
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart, and soul and strength. The oak staff came
down on Ghysbrecht's face with a frightful crash, and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) mule's tail beating the devil's tattoo with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) heels, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) face
streaming, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) collar spattered with blood.

<p/>The next moment the three were in the wood. The yell of dismay and
vengeance that burst from Ghysbrecht's men at that terrible blow which
felled their leader, told the fugitives that it was now a race for life
or death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why run?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, panting. <div class="bookquote">``You have your bow, and I have this,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bloody staff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>roared Martin; <div class="bookquote">``the GALLOWS! Follow me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fled into the
wood. Soon they heard a cry like a pack of hounds opening on sight of
the game. The men were in the wood, and saw them flitting amongst the
trees. Margaret moaned and panted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ran; and Gerard clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
teeth and grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) staff. The next minute they came to a stiff hazel
coppice. Martin dashed into it, and shouldered the young wood aside as
if it were standing corn.

<p/>Ere they had gone fifty yards in it they came to four blind paths.

<p/>Martin took one. <div class="bookquote">``Bend low,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). And, half creeping, they glided
along. Presently their path was again intersected with other little
tortuous paths. They took one of them. It seemed to lead back; but
it soon took a turn, and, after a while, brought them to a thick pine
grove, where the walking was good and hard. There were no paths here;
and the young fir-trees were so thick, you could not see three yards
before your nose.

<p/>When they had gone some way in this, Martin sat down; and, having
learned in war to lose all impression of danger with the danger itself,
took a piece of bread and a slice of ham out of his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) wallet, and began
quietly to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) breakfast.

<p/>The young ones looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) with dismay. He (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) replied to their looks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All Sevenbergen could not find you now; you will lose your purse,
Gerard, long before you get to Italy; is that the way to carry a purse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard looked, and there was a large triangular purse, entangled by its
chains to the buckle and strap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wallet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is none of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What is in it, I wonder?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
tried to detach it; but in passing through the coppice it had become
inextricably entangled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) strap and buckle. <div class="bookquote">``It seems loath to leave
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had to cut it loose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knife. The purse,
on examination, proved to be well provided with silver coins of all
sizes, but its bloated appearance was greatly owing to a number of
pieces of brown paper folded and doubled. A light burst on Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Why,
it must be that old thief's; and see! stuffed with paper to deceive the
world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the burgomaster</b></font>)</div><p/>The wonder was how the burgomaster's purse came on Gerard.

<p/>They hit at last upon the right solution. The purse must have been
at Ghysbrecht's saddle-bow, and Gerard rushing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) enemy, had
unconsciously torn it away, thus felling his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) enemy and robbing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), with
a single gesture.

<p/>Gerard was delighted at this feat, but Margaret was uneasy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Throw it away, Gerard, or let Martin take it back. Already they call
you a thief. I cannot bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Throw it away! give it him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) back? not a stiver! This is spoil lawfully
won in battle from an enemy. Is it not, Martin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course. Send him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) back the brown paper, and you will; but the
purse or the coin--that were a sin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gerard!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``you are going to a distant land. We need
the goodwill of Heaven. How can we hope for that if we take what is not
ours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>But Gerard saw it in a different light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Heaven that gives it me by a miracle, and I shall cherish it
accordingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>this youth</b></font>)</div>said this pious youth. <div class="bookquote">``Thus the favoured people spoiled
the Egyptians, and were blessed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take your own way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret humbly; <div class="bookquote">``you are wiser than I am. You
are my husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), in a low murmuring voice; <div class="bookquote">``is it for me to
gainsay you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>These humble words from Margaret, who, till that day, had held the
whip-hand, rather surprised Martin for the moment. They recurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
some time afterwards, and then they surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) less.

<p/>Gerard kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tenderly in return for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wife-like docility, and
they pursued their journey hand in hand, Martin leading the way,
into the depths of the huge forest. The farther they went, the more
absolutely secure from pursuit they felt. Indeed, the townspeople never
ventured so far as this into the trackless part of the forest.

<p/>Impetuous natures repent quickly. Gerard was no sooner out of all danger
than his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) conscience began to prick him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Martin, would I had not struck quite so hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom? Oh! let that pass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is cheap served.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Martin, I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) grey hairs as my stick fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). I doubt they will
not from my sight this while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin grunted with contempt. <div class="bookquote">``Who spares a badger for his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) grey hairs?
The greyer your enemy is, the older; and the older the craftier and the
craftier the better for a little killing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Killing? killing, Martin? Speak not of killing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>and Gerard shook all
over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much mistook if you have not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now Heaven forbid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The old vagabond's skull cracked like a walnut. Aha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven and the saints forbid it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) rolled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) mule like a stone shot out of a cart. Said I to
myself, `There is one wiped out,''' and the iron old soldier grinned
ruthlessly.

<p/>Gerard fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees and began to pray for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) enemy's life.

<p/>At this Martin lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) patience. ``Here's mummery. What! you that set up
for learning, know you not that a wise man never strikes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemy but
to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? And what is all this coil about killing of old men? If it
had been a young one, now, with the joys of life waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), wine,
women, and pillage! But an old fellow at the edge of the grave, why not
shove him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in? Go he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) must, to-day or to-morrow; and what better place for
greybeards? Now, if ever I should be so mischancy as to last so long
as Ghysbrecht did, and have to go on a mule's legs instead of Martin
Wittenhaagen's, and a back like this -LRB-striking the wood of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) bow-RRB-,
instead of this -LRB-striking the string-RRB-, I'll thank and bless any
young fellow who will knock me on the head, as you have done that old
shopkeeper; malison on his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) memory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, culpa mea! culpa mea!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, and smote upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>cried Martin to Margaret scornfully, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) is a priest at
heart still--and when he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) is not in ire, St. Paul, what a milksop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tush, Martin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret reproachfully: then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wreathed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms
round Gerard, and comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with the double magic of a woman's sense
and a woman's voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sweetheart!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>murmured she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you forget: you went not a step out of the
way to harm him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), who hunted you to your death. You fled from him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) it
was who spurred on you. Then did you strike; but in self-defence and
a single blow, and with that which was in your hand. Malice had drawn
knife, or struck again and again. How often have men been smitten with
staves not one but many blows, yet no lives lost! If then your enemy
has fallen, it is through his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) own malice, not yours, and by the will of
God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, Margaret; bless you for thinking so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but, beloved one, if you have had the misfortune to kill that

Oh, let us on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``I fear not man's vengeance, thanks to
Martin here and this thick wood: only Him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) I fear whose eye pierces the
forest and reads the heart of man. If I but struck in self-defence,
`tis well; but if in hate, He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may bid the avenger of blood follow me to
Italy--to Italy? ay, to earth's remotest bounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin peevishly. <div class="bookquote">``I can't hear for your chat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you hear nothing, Margaret; my ears are getting old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret listened, and presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heard a tuneful sound, like a
single stroke upon a deep ringing bell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) described it so to Martin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I heard it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so did I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard; <div class="bookquote">``it was beautiful. Ah! there it is again.
How sweetly it blends with the air. It is a long way off. It is before
us, is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! the echoes of this wood confound the ear of a stranger. It
comes from the pine grove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! the one we passed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Martin, is this anything? You look pale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonderful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin, with a sickly sneer. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) asks me is it
anything? Come, on, on! at any rate, let us reach a better place than
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A better place--for what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To stand at bay, Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin gravely; <div class="bookquote">``and die like soldiers,

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that sound?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``IT IS THE AVENGER OF BLOOD.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Martin, save him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)! Oh, Heaven be merciful What new mysterious peril

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``GIRL, IT'S A BLOODHOUND.''



 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XX

<p/>The courage, like the talent, of common men, runs in a narrow groove.
Take them but an inch out of that, and they are done. Martin's courage
was perfect as far as it went. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had met and baffled many dangers in
the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) rude life, and these familiar dangers he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could face
with Spartan fortitude, almost with indifference; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had never
been hunted by a bloodhound, nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) ever seen that brute's unerring
instinct baffled by human cunning. Here then a sense of the supernatural
combined with novelty to ungenteel his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) heart. After going a few steps,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) leaned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow, and energy and hope oozed out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). Gerard, to
whom the danger appeared slight in proportion as it was distant, urged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to flight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What avails it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin sadly; <div class="bookquote">``if we get clear of the wood we
shall die cheap; here, hard by, I know a place where we may die dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! good Martin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``despair not so quickly; there must
be some way to escape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Martin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``what if we were to part company? Gerard's
life alone is forfeit. Is there no way to draw the pursuit on us twain
and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) go safe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Girl, you know not the bloodhound's nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is not on this man's
track or that; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is on the track of blood. My life on't they have taken
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to where Ghysbrecht fell, and from the dead man's blood to the man
that shed it that cursed hound will lead them, though Gerard should run
through an army or swim the Meuse.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And again he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) leaned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) head sank.

<p/>The hound's mellow voice rang through the wood.

<p/>A cry more tunable
Was never halloed to, nor cheered with horn,
In Crete, in Sparta, or in Thessaly.

<p/>Strange that things beautiful should be terrible and deadly' The eye
of the boa-constrictor, while fascinating its prey, is lovely. No royal
crown holds such a jewel; it is a ruby with the emerald's green light
playing ever upon it. Yet the deer that sees it loses all power of
motion, and trembles, and awaits his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) death and even so, to compare
hearing with sight, this sweet and mellow sound seemed to fascinate
Martin Wittenhaagen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) stood uncertain, bewildered, and unnerved.
Gerard was little better now. Martin's last words had daunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
had struck an old man and shed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) blood, and, by means of that very
blood, blood's four-footed avenger was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) track. Was not the finger
of Heaven in this?

<p/>Whilst the men were thus benumbed, the woman's brain was all activity.
The man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved was in danger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lend me your knife,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to Martin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) gave it her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But `twill be little use in your hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).

<p/>Then Margaret did a sly thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) stepped behind Gerard, and furtively
drew the knife across her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arm, and made it bleed freely; then stooping,
smeared her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hose and shoes; and still as the blood trickled she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) smeared
them; but so adroitly that neither Gerard nor Martin saw. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
seized the soldier's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, be a man!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and let this end. Take us to some thick
place, where numbers will not avail our foes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin sulkily. <div class="bookquote">``Hurry avails not; we cannot shun the
hound, and the place is hard by;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>then turning to the left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) led the
way, as men go to execution.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) soon brought them to a thick hazel coppice, like the one that had
favoured their escape in the morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``this is but a furlong broad, but it will serve our
turn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are we to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get through this, and wait on the other side; then as they come
straggling through, shoot three, knock two on the head, and the rest
will kill us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all you can think of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Martin Wittenhaagen, I take the lead, for you have lost your
head. Come, can you obey so young a man as I am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, Martin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``do not gainsay Gerard! He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is wiser
than his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin yielded a sullen assent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do then as you see me do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard; and drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) huge knife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
cut at every step a hazel shoot or two close by the ground, and turning
round twisted them breast-high behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) among the standing shoots.
Martin did the same, but with a dogged hopeless air. When they had
thus painfully travelled through the greater part of the coppice, the
bloodhound's deep bay came nearer and nearer, less and less musical,
louder and sterner.

<p/>Margaret trembled.

<p/>Martin went down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) stomach and listened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear a horse's feet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard; <div class="bookquote">``I doubt it is a mule's. That cursed Ghysbrecht is
still alive: none other would follow me up so bitterly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never strike your enemy but to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin gloomily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll hit harder this time, if Heaven gives me the chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/>At last they worked through the coppice, and there was an open wood. The
trees were large, but far apart, and no escape possible that way.

<p/>And now with the hound's bay mingled a score of voices hooping and
hallooing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole village is out after us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I care not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Listen, Martin. I have made the track smooth
to the dog, but rough to the men, that we may deal with them apart.
Thus the hound will gain on the men, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) comes out of the
coppice we must kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The hound? There are more than one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear but one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! but one speaks, the others run mute; but let the leading hound lose
the scent, then another shall give tongue. There will be two dogs, at
least, or devils in dog's hides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we must kill two instead of one. The moment they are dead, into
the coppice again, and go right back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a good thought, Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>said Martin, plucking up heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! the men are in the wood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard now gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) orders in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand you with your bow by the side of the coppice--there, in the
ditch. I will go but a few yards to yon oak-tree, and hide behind it;
the dogs will follow me, and, as they come out, shoot as many as you
can, the rest will I brain as they come round the tree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin's eye flashed. They took up their places.

<p/>The hooping and hallooing came closer and closer, and soon even the
rustling of the young wood was heard, and every now and then the
unerring bloodhound gave a single bay.

<p/>It was terrible! the branches rustling nearer and nearer, and the
inevitable struggle for life and death coming on minute by minute,
and that death-knell leading it. A trembling hand was laid on Gerard's
shoulder. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) start violently, strung up as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Martin says if we are forced to part company, make for that high
ash-tree we came in by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! yes! yes! but go back for Heaven's sake! don't come here, all out
in the open!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) ran back towards Martin; but, ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could get to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), suddenly a
huge dog burst out of the coppice, and stood erect a moment. Margaret
cowered with fear, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) never noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Scent was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) what sight
is to us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) nose an instant, and the next moment, with an
awful yell, sprang straight at Gerard's tree and rolled head-over-heels
dead as a stone, literally spitted with an arrow from the bow that
twanged beside the coppice in Martin's hand. That same moment out came
another hound and smelt his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) dead comrade. Gerald rushed out at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>);
but ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) could use his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) cudgel, a streak of white lightning seemed to
strike the hound, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerald</b></font>) grovelled in the dust, wounded desperately, but
not killed, and howling piteously.

<p/>Gerard had not time to despatch him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>): the coppice rustled too near: it
seemed alive. Pointing wildly to Martin to go back, Gerard ran a few
yards to the right, then crept cautiously into the thick coppice just as
three men burst out. These had headed their comrades considerably: the
rest were following at various distances. Gerard crawled back almost on
all-fours. Instinct taught Martin and Margaret to do the same upon their
line of retreat. Thus, within the distance of a few yards, the pursuers
and pursued were passing one another upon opposite tracks.

<p/>A loud cry announced the discovery of the dead and the wounded hound.
Then followed a babble of voices, still swelling as fresh pursuers
reached the spot. The hunters, as usual on a surprise, were wasting
time, and the hunted ones were making the most of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear no more hounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>whispered Martin to Margaret, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was
himself again.

<p/>It was Margaret's turn to tremble and despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, why did we part with Gerard? They will kill my Gerard, and I not
near him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay! the head to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is not on their shoulders. You bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
meet us at the ash-tree?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I did. Bless you, Martin, for thinking of that. To the
ash-tree!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! but with less noise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now nearly at the edge of the coppice, when suddenly
they heard hooping and hallooing behind them. The men had satisfied
themselves the fugitives were in the coppice, and were beating back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>whispered Martin to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) trembling companion. <div class="bookquote">``We shall have
time to win clear and slip back out of sight by hard running. Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) stooped suddenly; for just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was going to burst out of the
brushwood, his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) eye caught a figure keeping sentinel. It was Ghysbrecht
Van Swieten seated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) mule; a bloody bandage was across his (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) nose,
the bridge of which was broken; but over this his (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) eyes peered keenly,
and it was plain by their expression he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) had heard the fugitives rustle,
and was looking out for them. Martin muttered a terrible oath, and
cautiously strung his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow, then with equal caution fitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) last arrow
to the string. Margaret put her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face, but said nothing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw this man must die or Gerard. After the first impulse she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) peered
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fingers, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heart panting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) throat.

<p/>The bow was raised, and the deadly arrow steadily drawn to its head,
when at that moment an active figure leaped on Ghysbrecht from behind so
swiftly, it was like a hawk swooping on a pigeon. A kerchief went over
the burgomaster, in a turn of the hand his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head was muffled in it, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was whirled from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) seat and fell heavily upon the ground, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
lay groaning with terror; and Gerard jumped down after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hist, Martin! Martin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin and Margaret came out, the former openmouthed crying, <div class="bookquote">``Now fly!
fly! while they are all in the thicket; we are saved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>At this crisis, when safety seemed at hand, as fate would have it,
Margaret, who had borne up so bravely till now, began to succumb, partly
from loss of blood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my beloved, fly!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Leave me, for I am faint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Death together, or safety. Ah! the mule! mount
her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), you, and I'll run by your side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>In a moment Martin was on Ghysbrecht's mule, and Gerard raised the
fainting girl in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arms and placed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on the saddle, and relieved
Martin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Help! treason! murder! murder!''  (<font color='red'><b>hams</b></font>)</div>shrieked Ghysbrecht, suddenly rising on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hams.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence, cur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>roared Gerard, and trode him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) down again by the throat as
men crush an adder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, have you got her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) firm? Then fly! for our lives! for our lives!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>But even as the mule, urged suddenly by Martin's heel, scattered the
flints with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hind hoofs ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) got into a canter, and even as Gerard
withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) foot from Ghysbrecht's throat to run, Dierich Brower and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) five men, who had come back for orders, and heard the burgomaster's
cries, burst roaring out of the coppice on them.



<p/>CHAPTER XXI

<p/>Speech is the familiar vent of human thoughts; but there are emotions so
simple and overpowering, that they rush out not in words, but eloquent
sounds. At such moments man seems to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) characteristics, and to
be merely one of the higher animals; for these, when greatly agitated,
ejaculate, though they cannot speak.

<p/>There was something terrible and truly animal, both in the roar
of triumph with which the pursuers burst out of the thicket on our
fugitives, and the sharp cry of terror with which these latter darted
away. The pursuers hands clutched the empty air, scarce two feet behind
them, as they fled for life. Confused for a moment, like lions that miss
their spring, Dierich and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) men let Gerard and the mule put ten yards
between them. Then they flew after with uplifted weapons. They were
sure of catching them; for this was not the first time the parties had
measured speed. In the open ground they had gained visibly on the three
this morning, and now, at last, it was a fair race again, to be settled
by speed alone. A hundred yards were covered in no time. Yet still there
remained these ten yards between the pursuers and the pursued.

<p/>This increase of speed since the morning puzzled Dierich Brower. The
reason was this. When three run in company, the pace is that of the
slowest of the three. From Peter's house to the edge of the forest
Gerard ran Margaret's pace; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own; for the mule was
fleet, and could have left them all far behind. Moreover, youth and
chaste living began to tell. Daylight grew imperceptibly between the
hunted ones and the hunters. Then Dierich made a desperate effort, and
gained two yards; but in a few seconds Gerard had stolen them quietly
back. The pursuers began to curse.

<p/>Martin heard, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) face lighted up. <div class="bookquote">``Courage, Gerard! courage, brave
lad! they are straggling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was so. Dierich was now headed by one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) men, and another dropped
into the rear altogether.

<p/>They came to a rising ground, not sharp, but long; and here youth, and
grit, and sober living told more than ever.

<p/>Ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) reached the top, Dierich's forty years weighed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) down like
forty bullets. <div class="bookquote">``Our cake is dough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dead, if you
can't alive;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) left running, and followed at a foot's pace. Jorian
Ketel tailed off next; and then another, and so, one by one, Gerard ran
them all to a standstill, except one who kept on stanch as a bloodhound,
though losing ground every minute. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) name, if I am not mistaken,
was Eric Wouverman. Followed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Wouverman</b></font>), they came to a rise in the wood,
shorter, but much steeper than the last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hand on mane!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>cried Martin.

<p/>Gerard obeyed, and the mule helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) up the hill faster even than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
was running before.

<p/>At the sight of this manoeuvre, Dierich's man lost heart, and, being now
full eighty yards behind Gerard, and rather more than that in advance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nearest comrade, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pulled up short, and, in obedience to Dierich's
order, took down his (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) crossbow, levelled it deliberately, and just as the
trio were sinking out of sight over the crest of the hill, sent the bolt
whizzing among them.

<p/>There was a cry of dismay; and, next moment, as if a thunder-bolt had
fallen on them, they were all lying on the ground, mule and all.



<p/>CHAPTER XXII

<p/>The effect was so sudden and magical, that the shooter himself was
stupefied for an instant. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>shooter</b></font>) hailed his (<font color='blue'><b>shooter</b></font>) companions to join him (<font color='blue'><b>shooter</b></font>) in
effecting the capture, and himself set off up the hill; but, ere he (<font color='blue'><b>shooter</b></font>) had
got half way, up rose the figure of Martin Wittenhaagen with a bent bow
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) hand. Eric Wouverman no sooner saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wouverman</b></font>) in this attitude, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Wouverman</b></font>)
darted behind a tree, and made himself as small as possible. Martin's
skill with that weapon was well known, and the slain dog was a keen
reminder of it.

<p/>Wouverman peered round the bark cautiously: there was the arrow's point
still aimed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wouverman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wouverman</b></font>) saw it shine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wouverman</b></font>) dared not move from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wouverman</b></font>) shelter.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Wouverman</b></font>) had been at peep-ho some minutes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wouverman</b></font>) companions came up in
great force.

<p/>Then, with a scornful laugh, Martin vanished, and presently was heard to
ride off on the mule.

<p/>All the men ran up together. The high ground commanded a view of a
narrow but almost interminable glade.

<p/>They saw Gerard and Margaret running along at a prodigious distance;
they looked like gnats; and Martin galloping after them ventre a terre.

<p/>The hunters were outwitted as well as outrun. A few words will explain
Martin's conduct. We arrive at causes by noting coincidences; yet, now
and then, coincidences are deceitful. As we have all seen a hare tumble
over a briar just as the gun went off, and so raise expectations, then
dash them to earth by scudding away untouched, so the burgomaster's mule
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) foot in a rabbit-hole at or about the time the crossbow bolt
whizzed innocuous over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head: she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fell and threw both her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) riders.
Gerard caught Margaret, but was carried down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) weight and impetus;
and, behold, the soil was strewed with dramatis personae.

<p/>The docile mule was up again directly, and stood trembling. Martin was
next, and looking round saw there was but one in pursuit; on this he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
made the young lovers fly on foot, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) checked the enemy as I have
recorded.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) now galloped after his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) companions, and when after a long race he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
caught them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) instantly put Gerard and Margaret on the mule, and ran
by their side till his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) breath failed, then took his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) turn to ride, and so
in rotation. Thus the runner was always fresh, and long ere they relaxed
their speed all sound and trace of them was hopelessly lost to Dierich
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) men. These latter went crestfallen back to look after their
chief and their winged bloodhound.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIII

<p/>Life and liberty, while safe, are little thought of: for why? they are
matters of course. Endangered, they are rated at their real value. In
this, too, they are like sunshine, whose beauty men notice not at noon
when it is greatest, but towards evening, when it lies in flakes of
topaz under shady elms. Yet it is feebler then; but gloom lies beside
it, and contrast reveals its fire. Thus Gerard and Margaret, though they
started at every leaf that rustled louder than its fellows, glowed all
over with joy and thankfulness as they glided among the friendly trees
in safety and deep tranquil silence, baying dogs and brutal voices yet
ringing in their mind's ears.

<p/>But presently Gerard found stains of blood on Margaret's ankles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Martin! Martin! help! they have wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>): the crossbow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, smiling to reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I am not wounded, nor
hurt at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is it, then, in Heaven's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, in great
agitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scold me not, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>and Margaret blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I ever scold you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear Gerard. Well, then, Martin said it was blood those cruel dogs
followed; so I thought if I could but have a little blood on my shoon,
the dogs would follow me instead, and let my Gerard wend free. So I
scratched my arm with Martin's knife--forgive me! Whose else could I
take? Yours, Gerard? Ah, no. You forgive me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) beseechingly, and
lovingly and fawningly, all in one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see this scratch first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, choking with emotion.
<div class="bookquote">``There, I thought so. A scratch? I call it a cut--a deep, terrible,
cruel cut.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard shuddered at sight of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might have done it with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bodkin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>said the soldier. <div class="bookquote">``Milksop!
that sickens at sight of a scratch and a little blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. I could look on a sea of blood, but not on hers. Oh, Margaret!
how could you be so cruel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret smiled with love ineffable. <div class="bookquote">``Foolish Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>murmured she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to
make so much of nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) flung the guilty arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) neck.
<div class="bookquote">``As if I would not give all the blood in my heart for you, let alone
a few drops from my arm.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And with this, under the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) recent
danger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wept on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) neck for pity and love; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wept with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I must part from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sobbed; <div class="bookquote">``we two that love so dear--one
must be in Holland, one in Italy. Ah me! ah me! ah me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At this Margaret wept afresh, but patiently and silently. Instinct is
never off its guard, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) unselfishness was an instinct.
To utter her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) present thoughts would be to add to Gerard's misery at
parting, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wept in silence.

<p/>Suddenly they emerged upon a beaten path, and Martin stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the bridle-road I spoke of,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hanging his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``and
there away lies the hostelry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret and Gerard cast a scared look at one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come a step with me, Martin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>whispered Gerard. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
aside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in a broken voice, <div class="bookquote">``Good Martin, watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
for me! She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is my wife; yet I leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). See Martin! here is gold--it
was for my journey; it is no use my asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to take it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would
not; but you will for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), will you not? Oh, Heaven! and is this all I
can do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)? Money? But poverty is a curse. You will not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) want
for anything, dear Martin? The burgomaster's silver is enough for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou art a good lad, Gerard. Neither want nor harm shall come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).
I care more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) little finger than for all the world; and were she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
nought to me, even for thy sake would I be a father to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Go with
a stout heart, and God be with thee going and coming.''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>And the rough
soldier wrung Gerard's hand, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head away, with unwonted
feeling.

<p/>After a moment's silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was for going back to Margaret, but Gerard
stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No, good Martin; prithee, stay here behind this thicket,
and turn your head away from us, while I-oh, Martin! Martin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>By this means Gerard escaped a witness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) anguish at leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
loved, and Martin escaped a piteous sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did not see the poor
young things kneel and renew before Heaven those holy vows cruel men had
interrupted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did not see them cling together like one, and then try
to part, and fail, and return to one another, and cling again, like
drowning, despairing creatures. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) heard Gerard sob, and sob, and
Margaret moan.

<p/>At last there was a hoarse cry, and feet pattered on the hard road.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) started up, and there was Gerard running wildly, with both hands
clasped above his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head, in prayer, and Margaret tottering back towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with palms extended piteously, as if for help, and ashy cheek and
eyes fixed on vacancy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arms, and spoke words of comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); but her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
mind could not take them in; only at the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) moaned
and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tight, and trembled violently.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) on the mule, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and so, supporting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) frame, which, from being strong like a boy, had now turned all
relaxed and powerless, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) slowly and sadly home.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not shed one tear, nor speak one word.

<p/>At the edge of the wood he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) off the mule, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) go across
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was bid.

<p/>Martin to Rotterdam. Sevenbergen was too hot for him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).

<p/>Gerard, severed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) loved, went like one in a dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hired a
horse and a guide at the little hostelry, and rode swiftly towards the
German frontier. But all was mechanical; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) senses felt blunted; trees
and houses and men moved by him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) like objects seen through a veil. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
companions spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) twice, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did not answer. Only once he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried
out savagely, <div class="bookquote">``Shall we never be out of this hateful country?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After many hours' riding they came to the brow of a steep hill; a small
brook ran at the bottom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halt!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the guide, and pointed across the valley. <div class="bookquote">``Here is
Germany.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On t'other side of the bourn. No need to ride down the hill, I trow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard dismounted without a word, and took the burgomaster's purse from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) girdle: while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) opened it, <div class="bookquote">``You will soon be out of this hateful
country,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) guide, half sulkily; <div class="bookquote">``mayhap the one you are going to
will like you no better; any way, though it be a church you have robbed,
they cannot take you, once across that bourn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>These words at another time would have earned the speaker an admonition
or a cuff. They fell on Gerard now like idle air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) paid the lad in
silence, and descended the hill alone. The brook was silvery; it ran
murmuring over little pebbles, that glittered, varnished by the clear
water; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat down and looked stupidly at them. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) drank of the
brook; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) laved his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hot feet and hands in it; it was very cold:
it waked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rose, and taking a run, leaped across it into Germany.
Even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) touched the strange land he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned suddenly and looked back.
<div class="bookquote">``Farewell, ungrateful country!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``But for her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) it would cost me
nought to leave you for ever, and all my kith and kin, and--the mother
that bore me, and--my playmates, and my little native town. Farewell,
fatherland--welcome the wide world! omne so-lum for-ti p p-at-r-a.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
with these brave words in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mouth he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) drooped suddenly with arms and
legs all weak, and sat down and sobbed bitterly upon the foreign soil.

<p/>When the young exile had sat a while bowed down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rose and dashed the
tears from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes like a man; and not casting a single glance more
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), to weaken his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart, stepped out into the wide world.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) love and heavy sorrow left no room in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) for vulgar misgivings.
Compared with rending himself from Margaret, it seemed a small thing to
go on foot to Italy in that rude age.

<p/>All nations meet in a convent. So, thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) good friends the monks,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own thirst of knowledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could speak most of the languages
needed on that long road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I will soon be at Rome;
the sooner the better now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>After walking a good league, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came to a place where four ways
met. Being country roads, and serpentine, they had puzzled many an
inexperienced neighbour passing from village to village. Gerard took out
a little dial Peter had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), and set it in the autumn sun, and by
this compass steered unhesitatingly for Rome inexperienced as a young
swallow flying south; but unlike the swallow, wandering south alone.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIV

<p/>Not far on this road he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) came upon a little group. Two men in sober suits
stood leaning lazily on each side of a horse, talking to one another.
The rider, in a silk doublet and bright green jerkin and hose, both
of English cloth, glossy as a mole, lay flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) stomach in the
afternoon sun, and looked an enormous lizard. His (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) velvet cloak -LRB-flaming
yellow-RRB- was carefully spread over the horse's loins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is aught amiss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>inquired Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that I wot of,''  (<font color='red'><b>the servants</b></font>)</div>replied one of the servants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But your master, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lies like a corpse. Are ye not ashamed to let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
grovel on the ground?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to; the bare ground is the best cure for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) disorder. If you get
sober in bed, it gives you a headache; but you leap up from the hard
ground like a lark in spring. Eh, Ulric?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) speaks sooth, young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ulric</b></font>)</div>said Ulric warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, is the gentleman drunk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The servants</b></font>)</div><p/>The servants burst into a hoarse laugh at the simplicity of Gerard's
question. But suddenly Ulric stopped, and eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) all over, said very
gravely, <div class="bookquote">``Who are you, and where born, that know not the Count is ever
drunk at this hour?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And Gerard found himself a suspected character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a stranger,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but a true man, and one that loves
knowledge; therefore ask I questions, and not for love of prying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you be a true man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ulric</b></font>)</div>said Ulric shrewdly, <div class="bookquote">``then give us trinkgeld for
the knowledge we have given you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ulric</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard looked blank, but putting a good face on it, said, <div class="bookquote">``Trinkgeld you
shall have, such as my lean purse can spare, an if you will tell me why
ye have ta’en his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cloak from the man and laid it on the beast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Under the inspiring influence of coming trinkgeld, two solutions were
instantly offered Gerard at once: the one was, that should the Count
come to himself -LRB-which, being a seasoned toper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was apt to do all
in a minute-RRB-, and find his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) horse standing sweating in the cold, while
a cloak lay idle at hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would fall to cursing, and peradventure
to laying on; the other, more pretentious, was, that a horse is a poor
milksop, which, drinking nothing but water, has to be cockered up and
warmed outside; but a master, being a creature ever filled with good
beer, has a store of inward heat that warms him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to the skin, and renders
a cloak a mere shred of idle vanity.

<p/>Each of the speakers fell in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) theory, and, to tell the
truth, both had taken a hair or two of the dog that had bitten their
master to the brain; so their voices presently rose so high, that the
green sot began to growl instead of snoring. In their heat they did not
notice this.

<p/>Ere long the argument took a turn that sooner or later was pretty sure
to enliven a discussion in that age. Hans, holding the bridle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
right hand, gave Ulric a sound cuff with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) left; Ulric returned it
with interest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) right hand being free; and at it they went, ding
dong, over the horse's mane, pommelling one another, and jagging the
poor beast, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) ran backward, and trode with iron heel upon a
promontory of the green lord; he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), like the toad stung by Ithuriel's
spear, started up howling, with one hand clapped to the smart and the
other tugging at his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hilt. The servants, amazed with terror, let the
horse go; he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) galloped off whinnying, the men in pursuit of him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) crying
out with fear, and the green noble after them, volleying curses, his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
naked sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) body rebounding from hedge to hedge in
his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) headlong but zigzag career down the narrow lane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In which hurtling''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>Gerard turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) back on them all, and went calmly
south, glad to have saved the four tin farthings he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had got ready for
trinkgeld, but far too heavy hearted even to smile at their drunken
extravagance.


<p/>The sun was nearly setting, and Gerard, who had now for some time been
hoping in vain to find an inn by the way, was very ill at ease. To make
matters worse, black clouds gathered over the sky.

<p/>Gerard quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pace almost to a run.

<p/>It was in vain; down came the rain in torrents, drenched the bewildered
traveller, and seemed to extinguish the very sun-for his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) rays, already
fading, could not cope with this new assailant.

<p/>Gerard trudged on, dark, and wet, and in an unknown region. <div class="bookquote">``Fool! to
leave Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>Presently the darkness thickened.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was entering a great wood. Huge branches shot across the narrow road,
and the benighted stranger groped his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) way in what seemed an interminable
and inky cave with a rugged floor, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) stumbled and stumbled as
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) went.

<p/>On, and on, and on, with shivering limbs and empty stomach, and fainting
heart, till the wolves rose from their lairs and bayed all round the
wood.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hair bristled; but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) cudgel, and prepared to sell his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
life dear.

<p/>There was no wind; and his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) excited ear heard light feet patter at times
over the newly fallen leaves, and low branches rustle with creatures
gliding swiftly past them.

<p/>Presently in the sea of ink there was a great fiery star close to the
ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hailed it as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) patron saint. <div class="bookquote">``CANDLE! a CANDLE!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) shouted, and tried to run. But the dark and rugged way soon stopped
that. The light was more distant than he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had thought. But at last, in
the very heart of the forest, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) found a house, with lighted candles
and loud voices inside it. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) looked up to see if there was a signboard.
There was none. <div class="bookquote">``Not an inn after all!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sadly. <div class="bookquote">``No matter; what
Christian would turn a dog out into this wood to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and with this
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) made for the door that led to the voices. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) opened it slowly, and
put his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head in timidly. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) drew it out abruptly, as if slapped in the
face, and recoiled into the rain and darkness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had peeped into a large but low room, the middle of which was filled
by a huge round stove, or clay oven, that reached to the ceiling;
round this, wet clothes were drying-some on lines, and some more
compendiously, on rustics. These latter habiliments, impregnated with
the wet of the day, but the dirt of a life, and lined with what another
foot traveller in these parts call <div class="bookquote">``rammish clowns,''  (<font color='red'><b>another foot traveller</b></font>)</div>evolved rank
vapours and compound odours inexpressible, in steaming clouds.

<p/>In one corner was a travelling family, a large one: thence flowed into
the common stock the peculiar sickly smell of neglected brats. Garlic
filled up the interstices of the air. And all this with closed window,
and intense heat of the central furnace, and the breath of at least
forty persons.

<p/>They had just supped.

<p/>Now Gerard, like most artists, had sensitive organs, and the potent
effluvia struck dismay into him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). But the rain lashed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) outside, and
the light and the fire tempted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could not force his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) way all at once through the palpable perfumes,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) returned to the light again and again, like the singed moth.
At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) discovered that the various smells did not entirely mix, no
fiend being there to stir them round. Odour of family predominated in
two corners; stewed rustic reigned supreme in the centre; and garlic in
the noisy group by the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found, too, by hasty analysis, that of
these the garlic described the smallest aerial orbit, and the scent of
reeking rustic darted farthest--a flavour as if ancient goats, or the
fathers of all foxes, had been drawn through a river, and were here
dried by Nebuchadnezzar.

<p/>So Gerard crept into a corner close to the door. But though the solidity
of the main fetors isolated them somewhat, the heat and reeking vapours
circulated, and made the walls drip; and the home-nurtured novice found
something like a cold snake wind about his (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) legs, and his (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) head turn to a
great lump of lead; and next, he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) felt like choking, sweetly slumbering,
and dying, all in one.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) was within an ace of swooning, but recovered to a deep sense of
disgust and discouragement; and settled to go back to Holland at peep
of day. This resolution formed, he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) plucked up a little heart; and being
faint with hunger, asked one of the men of garlic whether this was not
an inn after all?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whence come you, who know not `The Star of the Forest'?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a stranger; and in my country inns have aye a sign.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Droll country yours! What need of a sign to a public-house--a place
that every soul knows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard was too tired and faint for the labour of argument, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned
the conversation, and asked where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could find the landlord?

<p/>At this fresh display of ignorance, the native's contempt rose too high
for words. He (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) pointed to a middle-aged woman seated on the other side
of the oven; and turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) mates, let them know what an outlandish
animal was in the room. Thereat the loud voices stopped, one by one, as
the information penetrated the mass; and each eye turned, as on a pivot,
following Gerard, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) every movement, silently and zoologically.

<p/>The landlady sat on a chair an inch or two higher than the rest, between
two bundles. From the first, a huge heap of feathers and wings, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was
taking the downy plumes, and pulling the others from the quills, and so
filling bundle two littering the floor ankle-deep, and contributing to
the general stock a stuffy little malaria, which might have played a
distinguished part in a sweet room, but went for nothing here. Gerard
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could have something to eat.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) eyes with astonishment. ``Supper is over this hour and
more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I had none of it, good dame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that my fault? You were welcome to your share for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I was benighted, and a stranger; and belated sore against my will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I to do with that? All the world knows `The Star of the
Forest' sups from six till eight. Come before six, ye sup well; come
before eight, ye sup as pleases Heaven; come after eight, ye get a clean
bed, and a stirrup cup, or a horn of kine's milk, at the dawning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard looked blank. <div class="bookquote">``May I go to bed, then, dame?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sulkily ``for
it is ill sitting up wet and fasting, and the byword saith, `He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sups who
sleeps.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The beds are not come yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>replied the landlady. <div class="bookquote">``You will sleep when
the rest do. Inns are not built for one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Gerard's turn to be astonished. <div class="bookquote">``The beds were not come! what, in
Heaven's name, did she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was afraid to ask for every word
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had spoken hitherto had amazed the assembly, and zoological eyes were
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) felt them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) leaned against the wall, and sighed audibly.

<p/>At this fresh zoological trait, a titter went round the watchful
company.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So this is Germany,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>thought Gerard; <div class="bookquote">``and Germany is a great country by
Holland. Small nations for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) consoled himself by reflecting it was to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) last, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
first, night in the land. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reverie was interrupted by an elbow driven
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ribs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned sharp on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) assailant, who pointed across the
room. Gerard looked, and a woman in the corner was beckoning him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
went towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gingerly, being surprised and irresolute, so that to a
spectator her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beckoning finger seemed to be pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) across the floor
with a gut-line. When he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) had got up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Hold the child,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in a fine hearty voice; and in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) plumped the bairn into
Gerard's arms.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stood transfixed, jelly of lead in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands, and sudden horror in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) elongated countenance.

<p/>At this ruefully expressive face, the lynx-eyed conclave laughed loud
and long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never heed them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman cheerfully; <div class="bookquote">``they know no better;
how should they, bred an' born in a wood?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was rummaging among her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
clothes with the two penetrating hands, one of which Gerard had set
free. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fished out a small tin plate and a dried pudding;
and resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child with one arm, held them forth to Gerard with the
other, keeping a thumb on the pudding to prevent it from slipping off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put it in the stove,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you are too young to lie down
fasting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) warmly. But on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) way to the stove, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eye fell on
the landlady. <div class="bookquote">``May I, dame?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) beseechingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>).

<p/>The question was evidently another surprise, though less startling than
its predecessors.

<p/>Coming to the stove, Gerard found the oven door obstructed by <div class="bookquote">``the
rammish clowns.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>They did not budge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hesitated a moment. The landlady
saw, calmly put down her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) work, and coming up, pulled a hircine man or
two hither, and pushed a hircine man or two thither, with the impassive
countenance of a housewife moving her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) furniture. <div class="bookquote">``Turn about is fair
play,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``ye have been dry this ten minutes and better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) experienced eye was not deceived; Gorgonii had done stewing, and
begun baking. Debarred the stove, they trundled home, all but one, who
stood like a table, where the landlady had moved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to, like a table.
And Gerard baked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pudding; and getting to the stove, burst into
steam.

<p/>The door opened, and in flew a bundle of straw.

<p/>It was hurled by a hind with a pitchfork. Another and another came
flying after it, till the room was like a clean farmyard. These were
then dispersed round the stove in layers, like the seats in an arena,
and in a moment the company was all on its back.

<p/>The beds had come.

<p/>Gerard took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pudding, and found it delicious. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was
relishing it, the woman who had given it him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and who was now abed,
beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bundle side. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) is waiting for
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>whispered the woman. Gerard returned to the stove, and gobbled.
the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sausage, casting uneasy glances at the landlady, seated
silent as fate amid the prostrate multitude. The food bolted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went to
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you kindly, dame, for waiting for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) calmly, making neither much nor little of
the favour; and with that began to gather up the feathers. But Gerard
stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Nay, that is my task;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees, and
collected them with ardour. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) demurely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wot not whence ye come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), with a relic of distrust; adding,
more cordially, <div class="bookquote">``but ye have been well brought up;--y' have had a good
mother, I'll go bail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At the door she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) committed the whole company to Heaven, in a formula, and
disappeared. Gerard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) straw in the very corner-for the guests lay
round the sacred stove by seniority, i.e. priority of arrival.

<p/>This punishment was a boon to Gerard, for thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lay on the shore of
odour and stifling heat, instead of in mid-ocean.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was just dropping off, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was awaked by a noise; and lo there
was the hind remorselessly shaking and waking guest after guest, to ask
him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) whether it was he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) who had picked up the mistress's feathers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it was you, was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the sleepers</b></font>)</div>said the other, and came striding rapidly over
the intermediate sleepers. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bade me say, `One good turn deserves
another,' and so here's your nightcap,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thrust a great oaken mug
under Gerard's nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and bless her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); here goes--ugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gratitude ended in
a wry face; for the beer was muddy, and had a strange, medicinal twang
new to the Hollander.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trinke aus!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted the hind reproachfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enow is as good as a feast,''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>said the youth Jesuitically.

<p/>The hind cast a look of pity on this stranger who left liquor in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
mug. <div class="bookquote">``Ich brings euch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), and drained it to the bottom.

<p/>And now Gerard turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face to the wall and pulled up two handfuls of
the nice clean straw, and bored in them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) finger, and so made a
scabbard, and sheathed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nose in it. And soon they were all asleep;
men, maids, wives, and children all lying higgledy-piggledy, and snoring
in a dozen keys like an orchestra slowly tuning; and Gerard's body lay
on straw in Germany, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) spirit was away to Sevenbergen.


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) woke in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found nearly all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fellow-passengers
gone. One or two were waiting for dinner, nine o’clock; it was now
six. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) paid the landlady her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) demand, two pfenning, or about an English
halfpenny, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) of the pitchfork demanded trinkgeld, and getting a
trifle more than usual, and seeing Gerard eye a foaming milk-pail he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had
just brought from the cow, hoisted it up bodily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``Drink your
fill, man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and on Gerard offering to pay for the delicious
draught, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in broad patois that a man might swallow a skinful of
milk, or a breakfast of air, without putting hand to pouch. At the door
Gerard found his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) benefactress of last night, and a huge-chested artisan,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) husband.

<p/>Gerard thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and in the spirit of the age offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a creutzer
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pudding.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) repulsed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand quietly. <div class="bookquote">``For what do you take me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>),
colouring faintly; <div class="bookquote">``we are travellers and strangers the same as you, and
bound to feel for those in like plight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Gerard blushed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turn and stammered excuses.

<p/>The hulking husband grinned superior to them both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give the vixen a kiss for her (<font color='blue'><b>vixen</b></font>) pudding, and cry quits,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), with an
air impartial, judge-like and Jove-like.

<p/>Gerard obeyed the lofty behest, and kissed the wife's cheek. <div class="bookquote">``A blessing
go with you both, good people,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And God speed you, young man!''  (<font color='red'><b>the couple</b></font>)</div>replied the honest couple; and with that
they parted, and never met again in this world.

<p/>The sun had just risen: the rain-drops on the leaves glittered like
diamonds. The air was fresh and bracing, and Gerard steered south, and
did not even remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) resolve of overnight.

<p/>Eight leagues he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) walked that day, and in the afternoon came upon a huge
building with an enormous arched gateway and a postern by its side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A monastery!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) joyfully; <div class="bookquote">``I go no further lest I fare worse.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
applied at the postern, and on stating whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came and whither bound,
was instantly admitted and directed to the guestchamber, a large and
lofty room, where travellers were fed and lodged gratis by the charity
of the monastic orders. Soon the bell tinkled for vespers, and Gerard
entered the church of the convent, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) place heard a service
sung so exquisitely, it seemed the choir of heaven. But one thing was
wanting, Margaret was not there to hear it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and this made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sigh bitterly in mid rapture. At supper, plain but wholesome and
abundant food, and good beer, brewed in the convent, were set before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fellows, and at an early hour they were ushered into a large
dormitory, and the number being moderate, had each a truckle bed, and
for covering, sheepskins dressed with the fleece on; but previously to
this a monk, struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) youth and beauty, questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>), and soon
drew out his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) projects and his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) heart. When he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) was found to be convent
bred, and going alone to Rome, he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) became a personage, and in the morning
they showed him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) over the convent and made him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) stay and dine in the
refectory. They also pricked him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) a route on a slip of parchment, and the
prior gave him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) a silver guilden to help him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) on the road, and advised him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>)
to join the first honest company he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) should fall in with, <div class="bookquote">``and not face
alone the manifold perils of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perils?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard to himself.

<p/>That evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came to a small straggling town where was one inn; it
had no sign; but being now better versed in the customs of the country,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) detected it at once by the coats of arms on its walls. These belonged
to the distinguished visitors who had slept in it at different
epochs since its foundation, and left these customary tokens of their
patronage. At present it looked more like a mausoleum than a hotel.
Nothing moved nor sounded either in it or about it. Gerard hammered on
the great oak door: no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hallooed: no reply. After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
hallooed louder, and at last a little round window, or rather hole in
the wall, opened, a man's head protruded cautiously, like a tortoise's
from its shell, and eyed Gerard stolidly, but never uttered a syllable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this an inn?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>asked Gerard, with a covert sneer.

<p/>The head seemed to fall into a brown study; eventually it nodded, but
lazily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I have entertainment here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Again the head pondered and ended by nodding, but sullenly, and seemed a
skull overburdened with catch-penny interrogatories.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How am I to get within, an't please you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At this the head popped in, as if the last question had shot it; and a
hand popped out, pointed round the corner of the building, and slammed
the window.

<p/>Gerard followed the indication, and after some research discovered
that the fortification had one vulnerable part, a small low door on its
flank. As for the main entrance, that was used to keep out thieves and
customers, except once or twice in a year, when they entered together,
i.e., when some duke or count arrived in pomp with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) train of gaudy
ruffians.

<p/>Gerard, having penetrated the outer fort, soon found his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) way to the
stove -LRB-as the public room was called from the principal article in it-RRB-,
and sat down near the oven, in which were only a few live embers that
diffused a mild and grateful heat.

<p/>After waiting patiently a long time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) asked a grim old fellow with a
long white beard, who stalked solemnly in, and turned the hour-glass,
and then was stalking out, when supper would be. The grisly Ganymede
counted the guests on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fingers--<div class="bookquote">``When I see thrice as many here as
now.''  (<font color='red'><b>the guests</b></font>)</div>Gerard groaned.

<p/>The grisly tyrant resented the rebellious sound. <div class="bookquote">``Inns are not built
for one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``if you can't wait for the rest, look out for another
lodging.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard sighed.

<p/>At this the greybeard frowned.

<p/>After a while company trickled steadily in, till full eighty persons of
various conditions were congregated, and to our novice the place became
a chamber of horrors; for here the mothers got together and compared
ringworms, and the men scraped the mud off their shoes with their
knives, and left it on the floor, and combed their long hair out,
inmates included, and made their toilet, consisting generally of a dry
rub. Water, however, was brought in ewers. Gerard pounced on one of
these, but at sight of the liquid contents lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) temper and said
to the waiter, <div class="bookquote">``Wash you first your water, and then a man may wash his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hands withal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An' it likes you not, seek another inn!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard said nothing, but went quietly and courteously besought an old
traveller to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) how far it was to the next inn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About four leagues.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Gerard appreciated the grim pleasantry of the unbending sire.

<p/>That worthy now returned with an armful of wood, and counting the
travellers, put on a log for every six, by which act of raw justice the
hotter the room the more heat he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added. Poor Gerard noticed this little
flaw in the ancient man's logic, but carefully suppressed every symptom
of intelligence, lest his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feet should have to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) brains four
leagues farther that night.

<p/>When perspiration and suffocation were far advanced, they brought in
the table-cloths; but oh, so brown, so dirty, and so coarse; they seemed
like sacks that had been worn out in agriculture and come down to this,
or like shreads from the mainsail of some worn-out ship. The Hollander,
who had never seen such linen even in nightmare, uttered a faint cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>a traveller</b></font>)</div>inquired a traveller. Gerard pointed ruefully to
the dirty sackcloth. The other looked at it with lack lustre eye, and
comprehended nought.

<p/>A Burgundian soldier with his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) arbalest at his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) back came peeping over
Gerard's shoulder, and seeing what was amiss, laughed so loud that the
room rang again, then slapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) on the back and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Courage! le
diable est mort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard stared: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) doubted alike the good tidings and their
relevancy; but the tones were so hearty and the arbalestrier's face,
notwithstanding a formidable beard, was so gay and genial, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
smiled, and after a pause said drily, <div class="bookquote">``Il a bien faite avec l’eau et
linge du pays on allait le noircir a ne se reconnaitre plus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tiens, tiens!''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>cried the soldier, <div class="bookquote">``v'la qui parle le Francais peu s'en
faut,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) seated himself by Gerard, and in a moment was talking
volubly of war, women, and pillage, interlarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) discourse with
curious oaths, at which Gerard drew away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) more or less.

<p/>Presently in came the grisly servant, and counted them all on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
fingers superciliously, like Abraham telling sheep; then went out again,
and returned with a deal trencher and deal spoon to each.

<p/>Then there was an interval. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) brought them a long mug apiece made
of glass, and frowned. By-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stalked gloomily in with a hunch of
bread apiece, and exit with an injured air. Expectation thus raised,
the guests sat for nearly an hour balancing the wooden spoons, and with
their own knives whittling the bread. Eventually, when hope was extinct,
patience worn out, and hunger exhausted, a huge vessel was brought
in with pomp, the lid was removed, a cloud of steam rolled forth, and
behold some thin broth with square pieces of bread floating. This,
though not agreeable to the mind, served to distend the body. Slices of
Strasbourg ham followed, and pieces of salt fish, both so highly salted
that Gerard could hardly swallow a mouthful. Then came a kind of gruel,
and when the repast had lasted an hour and more, some hashed meat highly
peppered and the French and Dutch being now full to the brim with the
above dainties, and the draughts of beer the salt and spiced meats had
provoked, in came roasted kids, most excellent, and carp and trout fresh
from the stream. Gerard made an effort and looked angrily at them, but
<div class="bookquote">``could no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>as the poets say. The Burgundian swore by the liver and
pike-staff of the good centurion, the natives had outwitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Then
turning to Gerard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Courage, l’ami, le diable est mort,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as
loudly as before, but not with the same tone of conviction. The canny
natives had kept an internal corner for contingencies, and polished the
kid's very bones.

<p/>The feast ended with a dish of raw animalcula in a wicker cage. A cheese
had been surrounded with little twigs and strings; then a hole made
in it and a little sour wine poured in. This speedily bred a small but
numerous vermin. When the cheese was so rotten with them that only
the twigs and string kept it from tumbling to pieces and walking off
quadrivious, it came to table. By a malicious caprice of fate, cage
and menagerie were put down right under the Dutchman's organ of
self-torture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dutchman</b></font>) recoiled with a loud ejaculation, and hung to the bench
by the calves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dutchman</b></font>) legs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>a traveller</b></font>)</div>said a traveller disdainfully. <div class="bookquote">``Does the good
cheese scare ye? Then put it hither, in the name of all the saints!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cheese!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``I see none. These nauseous reptiles have made
away with every bit of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied another, <div class="bookquote">``it is not gone far. By eating of the mites we
eat the cheese to boot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, not so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``These reptiles are made like us, and digest
their food and turn it to foul flesh even as we do ours to sweet; as
well might you think to chew grass by eating of grass-fed beeves, as to
eat cheese by swallowing these uncleanly insects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) voice in uttering this, and the company received the
paradox in dead silence, and with a distrustful air, like any other
stranger, during which the Burgundian, who understood German but
imperfectly, made Gerard Gallicize the discussion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) patted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
interpreter on the back. <div class="bookquote">``C’est bien, mon gars; plus fin que toi n’est
pas bete,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>and administered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) formula of encouragement; and Gerard
edged away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); for next to ugly sights and ill odours, the poor
wretch disliked profaneness.

<p/>Meantime, though shaken in argument, the raw reptiles were duly eaten
and relished by the company, and served to provoke thirst, a principal
aim of all the solids in that part of Germany. So now the company drank
garausses all round, and their tongues were unloosed, and oh, the Babel!
But above the fierce clamour rose at intervals, like some hero's war-cry
in battle, the trumpet-like voice of the Burgundian soldier shouting
lustily, <div class="bookquote">``Courage, camarades, le diable est mort!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div><p/>Entered grisly Ganymede holding in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) hand a wooden dish with circles
and semicircles marked on it in chalk. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) put it down on the table
and stood silent, sad, and sombre, as Charon by Styx waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
boat-load of souls. Then pouches and purses were rummaged, and each
threw a coin into the dish. Gerard timidly observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had drunk
next to no beer, and inquired how much less he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was to pay than the
others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What mean you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Ganymede roughly. <div class="bookquote">``Whose fault is it you have not
drunken? Are all to suffer because one chooses to be a milksop? You will
pay no more than the rest, and no less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard was abashed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, petit, le diable est mort,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>hiccoughed the soldier and flung
Ganymede a coin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>milksop</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man peevishly; <div class="bookquote">``you are paying too
much;''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and the tyrannical old Aristides returned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) some coin out of
the trencher with a most reproachful countenance. And now the man whom
Gerard had confuted an hour and a half ago awoke from a brown study, in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been ever since, and came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, but the
honey is none the worse for passing through the bees' bellies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard stared. The answer had been so long on the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hadn't an idea
what it was an answer to. Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dumfounded, the other concluded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
confuted, and withdrew calmed.

<p/>The bedrooms were upstairs, dungeons with not a scrap of furniture
except the bed, and a male servant settled inexorably who should sleep
with whom. Neither money nor prayers would get a man a bed to himself
here; custom forbade it sternly. You might as well have asked to
monopolize a see-saw. They assigned to Gerard a man with a great black
beard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was an honest fellow enough, but not perfect; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would not go
to bed, and would sit on the edge of it telling the wretched Gerard by
force, and at length, the events of the day, and alternately laughing
and crying at the same circumstances, which were not in the smallest
degree pathetic or humorous, but only dead trivial. At last Gerard put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ears, and lying down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) clothes, for the sheets
were too dirty for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to undress, contrived to sleep. But in an hour or
two he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) awoke cold, and found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) drunken companion had got all the
feather bed; so mighty is instinct. They lay between two beds; the lower
one hard and made of straw, the upper soft and filled with feathers
light as down. Gerard pulled at it, but the experienced drunkard held
it fast mechanically. Gerard tried to twitch it away by surprise, but
instinct was too many for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). On this he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) got out of bed, and kneeling
down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bedfellow's unguarded side, easily whipped the prize away
and rolled with it under the bed, and there lay on one edge of it, and
curled the rest round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shoulders. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) slept he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) often heard
something grumbling and growling above him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), which was some little
satisfaction. Thus instinct was outwitted, and victorious Reason lay
chuckling on feathers, and not quite choked with dust.

<p/>At peep of day Gerard rose, flung the feather bed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) snoring
companion, and went in search of milk and air.

<p/>A cheerful voice hailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in French: <div class="bookquote">``What ho! you are up with the
sun, comrade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>French</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) rises betimes that lies in a dog's lair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>answered Gerard crossly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, l’ami! le diable est mort,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the instant reply. The soldier
then told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) name was Denys, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was passing from Flushing in
Zealand to the Duke's French dominions; a change the more agreeable to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should revisit his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) native place, and a host of pretty girls
who had wept at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) departure, and should hear French spoken again. <div class="bookquote">``And
who are you, and whither bound?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Gerard, and I am going to Rome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hollander</b></font>)</div>said the more reserved
Hollander, and in a way that invited no further confidences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the better; we will go together as far as Burgundy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not my road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All roads take to Rome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but the shortest road thither is my way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, it is I who must go out of my way a step for the sake
of good company, for thy face likes me, and thou speakest French, or
nearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There go two words to that bargain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard coldly. <div class="bookquote">``I steer by
proverbs, too. They do put old heads on young men's shoulders. `Bon loup
mauvais compagnon, dit le brebis;' and a soldier, they say, is near akin
to a wolf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys; ``besides, if he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) is, `les loups ne se mangent pas
entre eux.'''

<p/>``Aye but, sir soldier, I am not a wolf; and thou knowest, a bien petite
occasion se saisit le loup du mouton.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us drop wolves and sheep, being men; my meaning is, that a good
soldier never pillages-a comrade. Come, young man, too much suspicion
becomes not your years. They who travel should learn to read faces;
methinks you might see lealty in mine sith I have seen it in yourn. Is
it yon fat purse at your girdle you fear for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Gerard turned pale.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Look hither!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) undid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) belt, and poured out of it a double
handful of gold pieces, then returned them to their hiding-place.
<div class="bookquote">``There is a hostage for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``carry you that, and let us be
comrades,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) belt, gold and all.

<p/>Gerard stared. <div class="bookquote">``If I am over prudent, you have not enow.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) flushed
and looked pleased at the other's trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! I can read faces; and so must you, or you'll never take your four
bones safe to Rome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Soldier, you would find me a dull companion, for my heart is very
heavy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, yielding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll cheer you, mon gars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard sweetly; <div class="bookquote">``and sore need have I of a
kindly voice in mine ear this day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no soul is sad alongside me. I lift up their poor little hearts
with my consigne: `Courage, tout le monde, le diable est mort.' Ha! ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``But take back your belt, for I could
never trust by halves. We will go together as far as Rhine, and God go
with us both!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cap. <div class="bookquote">``En avant!''


 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>The pair trudged manfully on, and Denys enlivened the weary way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
chattered about battles and sieges, and things which were new to Gerard;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was one of those who make little incidents wherever they go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
passed nobody without addressing them. <div class="bookquote">``They don't understand it, but
it wakes them up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). But whenever they fell in with a monk
or priest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pulled a long face, and sought the reverend father's
blessing, and fearlessly poured out on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) floods of German words in
such order as not to produce a single German sentence--He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) doffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
cap to every woman, high or low, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) caught sight of, and with eagle eye
discerned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) best feature, and complimented her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) native
tongue, well adapted to such matters; and at each carrion crow or
magpie, down came his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) crossbow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would go a furlong off the road
to circumvent it; and indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did shoot one old crow with laudable
neatness and despatch, and carried it to the nearest hen-roost, and
there slipped in and set it upon a nest. ``The good-wife will say,
`Alack, here is Beelzebub ahatching of my eggs.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you forget he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>objected Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is, so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is. But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) doesn't know that, not having the luck
to be acquainted with me, who carry the good news from city to city,
uplifting men's hearts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Such was Denys in time of peace.

<p/>Our travellers towards nightfall reached a village; it was a very small
one, but contained a place of entertainment. They searched for it,
and found a small house with barn and stables. In the former was the
everlasting stove, and the clothes drying round it on lines, and a
traveller or two sitting morose. Gerard asked for supper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Supper? We have no time to cook for travellers; we only provide
lodging, good lodging for man and beast. You can have some beer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madman, who, born in Holland, sought other lands!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>snorted Gerard in
Dutch. The landlady started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What gibberish is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), and crossed herself with looks of
superstitious alarm. <div class="bookquote">``You can buy what you like in the village, and cook
it in our oven; but, prithee, mutter no charms nor sorceries here, good
man; don't ye now, it do make my flesh creep so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They scoured the village for food, and ended by supping on roasted eggs
and brown bread.

<p/>At a very early hour their chambermaid came for them. It was a
rosy-cheeked old fellow with a lanthorn.

<p/>They followed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) led them across a dirty farmyard, where they had
much ado to pick their steps, and brought them into a cow-house. There,
on each side of every cow, was laid a little clean straw, and a tied
bundle of ditto for a pillow. The old man looked down on this his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work
with paternal pride. Not so Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``What, do you set Christian men to
lie among cattle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is hard upon the poor beasts. They have scarce room to turn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! what, it is not hard on us, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the hardship? I have lain among them all my life. Look at me!
I am fourscore, and never had a headache in all my born days--all along
of lying among the kye. Bless your silly head, kine's breath is ten
times sweeter to drink nor Christians'. You try it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) slammed the
bedroom door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Denys, where are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>whined Gerard.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forget me not in them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Burrow in the straw, then. You must be very new to the world, to
grumble at this. How would you bear to lie on the field of battle on a
frosty night, as I did t'other day, stark naked, with nothing to keep me
warm but the carcass of a fellow I had been and helped kill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Horrible! horrible! Tell me all about it! Oh, but this is sweet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we had a little battle in Brabant, and won a little victory, but
it cost us dear; several arbalestriers turned their toes up, and I among
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Killed, Denys? come now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead as mutton. Stuck full of pike-holes till the blood ran out of
me, like the good wine of Macon from the trodden grapes. It is right
bounteous in me to pour the tale in minstrel phrase, for--augh--I am
sleepy. Augh--now where was I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Left dead on the field of battle, bleeding like a pig; that is to say,
like grapes, or something; go on, prithee go on, `tis a sin to sleep in
the midst of a good story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Granted. Well, some of those vagabonds, that strip the dead soldier on
the field of glory, came and took every rag off me; they wrought me no
further ill, because there was no need.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you were dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``C’est convenu. This must have been at sundown; and with the night came
a shrewd frost that barkened the blood on my wounds, and stopped all the
rivulets that were running from my heart, and about midnight I awoke as
from a trance.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And thought you were in heaven?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>asked Gerard eagerly, being a youth
inoculated with monkish tales.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too frost-bitten for that, mon gars; besides, I heard the wounded
groaning on all sides, so I knew I was in the old place. I saw I could
not live the night through without cover. I groped about shivering and
shivering; at last one did suddenly leave groaning. `You are sped,' said
I, so made up to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and true enough he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was dead, but warm, you know.
I took my lord in my arms, but was too weak to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), so rolled with
him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) into a ditch hard by; and there my comrades found me in the morning
properly stung with nettles, and hugging a dead Fleming for the bare
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``And this is war; this is the chosen theme of poets
and troubadours, and Reden Ryckers. Truly was it said by the men of old,
dulce bellum inexpertis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tu dis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say-oh, what stout hearts some men have!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``N’est-ce pas, p'tit? So after that sort--thing--this sort thing is
heaven. Soft--warm--good company, comradancow--cou’age--diable--m-ornk!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And the glib tongue was still for some hours.

<p/>In the morning Gerard was wakened by a liquid hitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eye, and it
was Denys employing the cow's udder as a squirt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, fie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``to waste the good milk;''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took a horn
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wallet. <div class="bookquote">``Fill this! but indeed I see not what right we have
to meddle with her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) milk at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make your mind easy! Last night la camarade was not nice; but what
then, true friendship dispenses with ceremony. To-day we make as free
with her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what did she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) do, poor thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ate my pillow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On waking I had to hunt for my head, and found it down in the stable
gutter. She (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) ate our pillow from us, we drink our pillow from her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>). A
votre sante, madame; et sans rancune;''  (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div>and the dog drank her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) milk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
own health.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The ancient was right though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Never have I risen so
refreshed since I left my native land. Henceforth let us shun great
towns, and still lie in a convent or a cow-house; for I'd liever sleep
on fresh straw, than on linen well washed six months agone; and the
breath of kine it is sweeter than that of Christians, let alone the
garlic, which men and women folk affect, but cowen abhor from, and so do
I, St. Bavon be my witness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The soldier</b></font>)</div><p/>The soldier eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) from head to foot: <div class="bookquote">``Now but for that little tuft on
your chin I should take you for a girl; and by the finger-nails of St.
Luke, no ill-favoured one neither.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>These three towns proved types and repeated themselves with slight
variations for many a weary league; but even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could get neither a
convent nor a cow-house, Gerard learned in time to steel himself to
the inevitable, and to emulate his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) comrade, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked on as almost
superhuman for hardihood of body and spirit.

<p/>There was, however, a balance to all this veneration.

<p/>Denys, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) predecessor Achilles, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) weak part, his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) very weak
part, thought Gerard.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) foible was <div class="bookquote">``woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was saying or doing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stopped short at sight of a
farthingale, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) whole soul became occupied with that garment and
its inmate till they had disappeared; and sometimes for a good while
after.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) often put Gerard to the blush by talking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) amazing German to such
females as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) caught standing or sitting indoors or out, at which they
stared; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) met a peasant girl on the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cap
to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and saluted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a queen; the invariable effect of
which was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suddenly drew herself up quite stiff like a soldier
on parade, and wore a forbidding countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They drive me to despair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys. <div class="bookquote">``Is that a just return to a
civil bonnetade? They are large, they are fair, but stupid as swans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What breeding can you expect from women that wear no hose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>inquired
Gerard; <div class="bookquote">``and some of them no shoon? They seem to me reserved and modest,
as becomes their sex, and sober, whereas the men are little better than
beer-barrels. Would you have them brazen as well as hoseless?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little affability adorns even beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>sighed Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let these alone, sith they are not to your taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>retorted
Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``What, is there no sweet face in Burgundy that would pale to see
you so wrapped up in strange women?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half-a-dozen that would cry their eyes out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is a long way to Burgundy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, to the foot, but not to the heart. I am there, sleeping and waking,
and almost every minute of the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Burgundy? Why, I thought you had never--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Burgundy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``No, in sweet Sevenbergen.
Ah! well-a-day! well-a-day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Many such dialogues as this passed between the pair on the long and
weary road, and neither could change the other.

<p/>One day about noon they reached a town of some pretensions, and Gerard
was glad, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wanted to buy a pair of shoes; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own were quite worn
out. They soon found a shop that displayed a goodly array, and made up
to it, and would have entered it, but the shopkeeper sat on the doorstep
taking a nap, and was so fat as to block up the narrow doorway; the very
light could hardly struggle past his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``too, too solid flesh,''  (<font color='red'><b>the shopkeeper</b></font>)</div>much less a
carnal customer.

<p/>My fair readers, accustomed, when they go shopping, to be met half way
with nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles, and waved into a seat, while
almost at the same instant an eager shopman flings himself half
across the counter in a semi-circle to learn their commands, can best
appreciate this mediaeval Teuton, who kept a shop as a dog keeps a
kennel, and sat at the exclusion of custom snoring like a pig.

<p/>Denys and Gerard stood and contemplated this curiosity; emblem, permit
me to remark, of the lets and hindrances to commerce that characterized
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) epoch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jump over him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The door is too low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``March through him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The man is too thick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the coil?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired a mumbling voice from the interior;
apprentice with his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mouth full.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We want to get into your shop?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for, in Heaven's name??!!!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shoon, lazy bones!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The ire of the apprentice began to rise at such an explanation. <div class="bookquote">``And
could ye find no hour out of all the twelve to come pestering us for
shoon, but the one little, little hour my master takes his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) nap, and I
sit down to my dinner, when all the rest of the world is full long ago?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys heard, but could not follow the sense. <div class="bookquote">``Waste no more time talking
their German gibberish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``take out thy knife and tickle his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) fat
ribs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I will not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then here goes; I'll prong him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) with this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard seized the mad fellow's arm in dismay, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been long
enough in the country to guess that the whole town would take part in
any brawl with the native against a stranger. But Denys twisted away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), and the cross-bow bolt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hand was actually on the road to
the sleeper's ribs; but at that very moment two females crossed the road
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) saw the blissful vision, and instantly forgot what he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
was about, and awaited their approach with unreasonable joy.

<p/>Though companions, they were not equals, except in attractiveness to a
Burgundian crossbow man; for one was very tall, the other short, and
by one of those anomalies which society, however primitive, speedily
establishes, the long one held up the little one's tail. The tall one
wore a plain linen coif on her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) head, a little grogram cloak over her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
shoulders, a grey kirtle, and a short farthingale or petticoat of bright
red cloth, and feet and legs quite bare, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) arms were veiled in
tight linen sleeves.

<p/>The other a kirtle broadly trimmed with fur, her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) arms in double sleeves,
whereof the inner of yellow satin clung to the skin; the outer, all
befurred, were open at the inside of the elbow, and so the arm passed
through and left them dangling. Velvet head-dress, huge purse at girdle,
gorgeous train, bare legs. And thus they came on, the citizen's wife
strutting, and the maid gliding after, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mistress's train
devoutly in both hands, and bending and winding her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) lithe body prettily
enough to do it. Imagine -LRB-if not pressed for time-RRB- a bantam, with a
guineahen stepping obsequious at its stately heel.

<p/>This pageant made straight for the shoemaker's shop. Denys louted low;
the worshipful lady nodded graciously, but rapidly, having business
on hand, or rather on foot; for in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) poked the point of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
little shoe into the sleeper, and worked it round in him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) like a gimlet,
till with a long snarl he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) woke. The incarnate shutter rising and
grumbling vaguely, the lady swept in and deigned him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) no further notice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) retreated to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) neighbour's shop, the tailor's, and sitting on the
step, protected it from the impertinence of morning calls. Neighbours
should be neighbourly.

<p/>Denys and Gerard followed the dignity into the shop, where sat the
apprentice at dinner; the maid stood outside with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) insteps crossed,
leaning against the wall, and tapping it with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) nails.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those, yonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the dignity briefly, pointing with an imperious
little white hand to some yellow shoes gilded at the toe. While the
apprentice stood stock still neutralized by his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) dinner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) duty,
Denys sprang at the shoes, and brought them to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) smiled, and
calmly seating herself, protruded her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) foot, shod, but hoseless, and
scented. Down went Denys on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) knees, and drew off her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) shoe, and tried
the new ones on the white skin devoutly. Finding she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had a willing
victim, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) abused the opportunity, tried first one pair, then another,
then the first again, and so on, balancing and hesitating for about half
an hour, to Gerard's disgust, and Denys's weak delight. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was
fitted, and handed two pair of yellow and one pair of red shoes out to
her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) servant. Then was heard a sigh. It burst from the owner of the shop:
he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had risen from slumber, and was now hovering about, like a partridge
near her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) brood in danger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There go all my coloured shoes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), as they disappeared in the
girl's apron.

<p/>The lady departed: Gerard fitted himself with a stout pair, asked the
price, paid it without a word, and gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) old ones to a beggar in the
street, who blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in the marketplace, and threw them furiously
down a well in the suburbs. The comrades left the shop, and in it two
melancholy men, that looked, and even talked, as if they had been robbed
wholesale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My shoon are sore worn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) teeth; <div class="bookquote">``but I'll go
barefoot till I reach France, ere I'll leave my money with such churls
as these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>The Dutchman replied calmly, <div class="bookquote">``They seem indifferent well sewn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Dutchman</b></font>)</div><p/>As they drew near the Rhine, they passed through forest after forest,
and now for the first time ugly words sounded in travellers' mouths,
seated around stoves. <div class="bookquote">``Thieves!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``black gangs!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``cut-throats!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>etc..

<p/>The very rustics were said to have a custom hereabouts of murdering the
unwary traveller in these gloomy woods, whose dark and devious winding
enabled those who were familiar with them to do deeds of rapine and
blood undetected, or if detected, easily to baffle pursuit.

<p/>Certain it was, that every clown they met carried, whether for offence
or defence, a most formidable weapon; a light axe, with a short pike at
the head, and a long slender handle of ash or yew, well seasoned. These
the natives could all throw with singular precision, so as to make
the point strike an object at several yard's distance, or could slay
a bullock at hand with a stroke of the blade. Gerard bought one and
practised with it. Denys quietly filed and ground his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) bolt sharp,
whistling the whilst; and when they entered a gloomy wood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) would
unsling his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) crossbow and carry it ready for action; but not so much like
a traveller fearing an attack, as a sportsman watchful not to miss a
snap shot.

<p/>One day, being in a forest a few leagues from Dusseldorf, as Gerard was
walking like one in a dream, thinking of Margaret, and scarce seeing the
road he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) trode, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) companion laid a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) shoulder, and strung
his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) crossbow with glittering eye. <div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), in a low whisper that
startled Gerard more than thunder. Gerard grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) axe tight, and
shook a little: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard a rustling in the wood hard by, and at the
same moment Denys sprang into the wood, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) crossbow went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
shoulder, even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) jumped. Twang! went the metal string; and after an
instant's suspense he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) roared, <div class="bookquote">``Run forward, guard the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is hit!
he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is hit!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard darted forward, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ran a young bear burst out of the wood
right upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); finding itself intercepted, it went upon its hind legs
with a snarl, and though not half grown, opened formidable jaws and long
claws. Gerard, in a fury of excitement and agitation, flung himself on
it, and delivered a tremendous blow on its nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) axe, and the
creature staggered; another, and it lay grovelling, with Gerard hacking
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo! stop! you are mad to spoil the meat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I took it for a robber,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, panting. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, I had made
ready for a robber, so I could not hold my hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, these chattering travellers have stuffed your head full of thieves
and assassins; they have not got a real live robber in their whole
nation. Nay, I'll carry the beast; bear thou my crossbow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will carry it by turns, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``for `tis a heavy load:
poor thing, how its blood drips. Why did we slay it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For supper and the reward the baillie of the next town shall give us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for that it must die, when it had but just begun to live; and
perchance it hath a mother that will miss it sore this night, and loves
it as ours love us; more than mine does me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, know you not that his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) mother was caught in a pitfall last month,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) skin is now at the tanner's? and his (<font color='blue'><b>tanner</b></font>) father was stuck full of
cloth-yard shafts t'other day, and died like Julius Caesar, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>)
hands folded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) bosom, and a dead dog in each of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>But Gerard would not view it jestingly. <div class="bookquote">``Why, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we have
killed one of God's creatures that was all alone in the world-as I am
this day, in this strange land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You young milksop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>roared Denys, <div class="bookquote">``these things must not be looked
at so, or not another bow would be drawn nor quarrel fly in forest nor
battlefield. Why, one of your kidney consorting with a troop of pikemen
should turn them to a row of milk-pails; it is ended, to Rome thou goest
not alone, for never wouldst thou reach the Alps in a whole skin. I take
thee to Remiremont, my native place, and there I marry thee to my young
sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is blooming as a peach. Thou shakest thy head? ah! I forgot;
thou lovest elsewhere, and art a one woman man, a creature to me scarce
conceivable. Well then I shall find thee, not a wife, nor a leman, but
a friend; some honest Burgundian who shall go with thee as far as Lyons;
and much I doubt that honest fellow will be myself, into whose liquor
thou has dropped sundry powders to make me love thee; for erst I endured
not doves in doublet and hose. From Lyons, I say, I can trust thee
by ship to Italy, which being by all accounts the very stronghold of
milksops, thou wilt there be safe: they will hear thy words, and make
thee their duke in a twinkling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard sighed. <div class="bookquote">``In sooth I love not to think of this Dusseldorf, where
we are to part company, good friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked silently, each thinking of the separation at hand; the
thought checked trifling conversation, and at these moments it is a
relief to do something, however insignificant. Gerard asked Denys to
lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a bolt. <div class="bookquote">``I have often shot with a long bow, but never with one
of these!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Draw thy knife and cut this one out of the cub,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys slily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Day, I want a clean one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) three out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) quiver.

<p/>Gerard strung the bow, and levelled it at a bough that had fallen into
the road at some distance. The power of the instrument surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>);
the short but thick steel bow jarred him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to the very heel as it went
off, and the swift steel shaft was invisible in its passage; only the
dead leaves, with which November had carpeted the narrow road, flew
about on the other side of the bough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye aimed a thought too high,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a deadly thing! no wonder it is driving out the longbow--to
Martin's much discontent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``it gains ground every day, in spite
of their laws and their proclamations to keep up the yewen bow, because
forsooth their grandsires shot with it, knowing no better. You see,
Gerard, war is not pastime. Men will shoot at their enemies with the
hittingest arm and the killingest, not with the longest and missingest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then these new engines I hear of will put both bows down; for these
with a pinch of black dust, and a leaden ball, and a child's finger,
shall slay you Mars and Goliath, and the Seven Champions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys warmly; <div class="bookquote">``petrone nor harquebuss shall ever put
down Sir Arbalest. Why, we can shoot ten times while they are putting
their charcoal and their lead into their leathern smoke belchers, and
then kindling their matches. All that is too fumbling for the field of
battle; there a soldier's weapon needs be aye ready, like his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard did not answer, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ear was attracted by a sound behind
them. It was a peculiar sound, too, like something heavy, but not hard,
rushing softly over the dead leaves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned round with some little
curiosity. A colossal creature was coming down the road at about sixty
paces' distance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked at it in a sort of calm stupor at first, but the next moment,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned ashy pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Denys!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, God! Denys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys whirled round.

<p/>It was a bear as big as a cart-horse.

<p/>It was tearing along with its huge head down, running on a hot scent.

<p/>The very moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) saw it Denys said in a sickening whisper--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THE CUB!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh! the concentrated horror of that one word, whispered hoarsely, with
dilating eyes! For in that syllable it all flashed upon them both like
a sudden stroke of lightning in the dark--the bloody trail, the murdered
cub, the mother upon them, and it. DEATH.

<p/>All this in a moment of time. The next, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw them. Huge as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed to double herself -LRB-it was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) long hair bristling with rage-RRB-:
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head big as a hull's, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) swine-shaped jaws opened wide
at them, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes turned to blood and flame, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rushed upon them,
scattering the leaves about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) like a whirlwind as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shoot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>screamed Denys, but Gerard stood shaking from head to foot,
useless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shoot, man! ten thousand devils, shoot! too late! Tree! tree!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
dropped the cub, pushed Gerard across the road, and flew to the first
tree and climbed it, Gerard the same on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) side; and as they fled, both
men uttered inhuman howls like savage creatures grazed by death.

<p/>With all their speed one or other would have been torn to fragments at
the foot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tree; but the bear stopped a moment at the cub.

<p/>Without taking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bloodshot eyes off those she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was hunting, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smelt
it all round, and found, how, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Creator only knows, that it was dead,
quite dead. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave a yell such as neither of the hunted ones had ever
heard, nor dreamed to be in nature, and flew after Denys. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reared and
struck at him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) climbed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was just out of reach.

<p/>Instantly she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seized the tree, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) huge teeth tore a great
piece out of it with a crash. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reared again, dug her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) claws deep
into the bark, and began to mount it slowly, but as surely as a monkey.

<p/>Denys's evil star had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) to a dead tree, a mere shaft, and of no
very great height. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) climbed faster than his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) pursuer, and was soon at
the top. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) looked this way and that for some bough of another tree to
spring to. There was none; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) jumped down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) knew the bear would
be upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) could recover the fall, and make short work of him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).
Moreover, Denys was little used to turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) back on danger, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
blood was rising at being hunted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) turned to bay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My hour is come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Let me meet death like a man.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
kneeled down and grasped a small shoot to steady himself, drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) long
knife, and clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) teeth, prepared to jab the huge brute as soon
as it should mount within reach.

<p/>Of this combat the result was not doubtful.

<p/>The monster's head and neck were scarce vulnerable for bone and masses
of hair. The man was going to sting the bear, and the bear to crack the
man like a nut.

<p/>Gerard's heart was better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nerves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friend's mortal
danger, and passed at once from fear to blindish rage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) slipped down
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tree in a moment, caught up the crossbow, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had dropped in
the road, and running furiously up, sent a bolt into the bear's body
with a loud shout. The bear gave a snarl of rage and pain, and turned
its head irresolutely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep aloof!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys, <div class="bookquote">``or you are a dead man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I care not;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had another bolt ready and shot it
fiercely into the bear, screaming, <div class="bookquote">``Take that! take that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys poured a volley of oaths down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Get away, idiot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was right: the bear finding so formidable and noisy a foe behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), slipped growling down the tree, rending deep furrows in it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
slipped. Gerard ran back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tree and climbed it swiftly. But while
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) legs were dangling some eight feet from the ground, the bear came
rearing and struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) fore paw, and out flew a piece of bloody
cloth from Gerard's hose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) climbed, and climbed; and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
heard as it were in the air a voice say, <div class="bookquote">``Go out on the bough!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
looked, and there was a long massive branch before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shooting upwards
at a slight angle: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) body across it, and by a series of
convulsive efforts worked up it to the end.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked round panting.

<p/>The bear was mounting the tree on the other side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) claws
scrape, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) bulge on both sides of the massive tree. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) eye not
being very quick, she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) reached the fork and passed it, mounting the main
stem. Gerard drew breath more freely. The bear either heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), or
found by scent she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was wrong: she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) paused; presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) caught sight of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) steadily, then quietly descended to the fork.

<p/>Slowly and cautiously she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) stretched out a paw and tried the bough. It
was a stiff oak branch, sound as iron. Instinct taught the creature
this: it crawled carefully out on the bough, growling savagely as it
came.

<p/>Gerard looked wildly down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was forty feet from the ground. Death
below. Death moving slow but sure on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in a still more horrible
form. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hair bristled. The sweat poured from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat helpless,
fascinated, tongue-tied.

<p/>As the fearful monster crawled growling towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), incongruous
thoughts coursed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mind. Margaret: the Vulgate, where it
speaks of the rage of a she-bear robbed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) whelps--Rome--Eternity.

<p/>The bear crawled on. And now the stupor of death fell on the doomed man;
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the open jaws and bloodshot eyes coming, but in a mist.

<p/>As in a mist he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard a twang; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glanced down; Denys, white and silent
as death, was shooting up at the bear. The bear snarled at the twang.
but crawled on. Again the crossbow twanged, and the bear snarled, and
came nearer. Again the cross bow twanged; and the next moment the bear
was close upon Gerard, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat, with hair standing stiff on end and
eyes starting from their sockets, palsied. The bear opened her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) jaws like
a grave, and hot blood spouted from them upon Gerard as from a pump. The
bough rocked. The wounded monster was reeling; it clung, it stuck its
sickles of claws deep into the wood; it toppled, its claws held firm,
but its body rolled off, and the sudden shock to the branch shook Gerard
forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stomach with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face upon one of the bear's straining
paws. At this, by a convulsive effort, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) head up, up, till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hot fetid breath. Then huge teeth snapped together loudly
close below him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in the air, with a last effort of baffled hate. The
ponderous carcass rent the claws out of the bough, then pounded the
earth with a tremendous thump. There was a shout of triumph below,
and the very next instant a cry of dismay, for Gerard had swooned, and
without an attempt to save himself, rolled headlong from the perilous
height.



<p/>CHAPTER XXV

<p/>Denys caught at Gerard, and somewhat checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fall; but it may be
doubted whether this alone would have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) from breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
neck, or a limb. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) best friend now was the dying bear, on whose hairy
carcass his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head and shoulders descended. Denys tore him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) off her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). It was
needless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) panted still, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) limbs quivered, but a hare was not
so harmless; and soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) breathed her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) last; and the judicious Denys
propped Gerard up against her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), being soft, and fanned him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) came to
by degrees, but confused, and feeling the bear around him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), rolled away,
yelling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys, <div class="bookquote">``le diable est mort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it dead? quite dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>inquired Gerard from behind a tree; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
courage was feverish, and the cold fit was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) just now, and had been
for some time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Behold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, and pulled the brute's ear playfully, and opened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) jaws and put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) head, with other insulting antics; in the midst
of which Gerard was violently sick.

<p/>Denys laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``also, why tumble off your perch just
when we had won the day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I swooned, I trow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Not receiving an answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``Green girls faint as soon
as look at you, but then they choose time and place. What woman ever
fainted up a tree?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nasty blood all over me. I think the smell must have
overpowered me! Faugh! I hate blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do believe it potently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``See what a mess she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has made me

<p/>``But with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) blood, not yours. I pity the enemy that strives to satisfy
you.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not to brag, Maitre Denys; I saw you under the tree, the
colour of your shirt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us distinguish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, colouring; <div class="bookquote">``it is permitted to tremble
for a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard, for answer, flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) arms round Denys's neck in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stout soldier</b></font>)</div>whined the stout soldier, affected by this little gush of
nature and youth, <div class="bookquote">``was ever aught so like a woman? I love thee, little
milksop--go to. Good! behold him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knees now. What new caprice is
this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Denys, ought we not to return thanks to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) who has saved both our
lives against such fearful odds?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>And Gerard kneeled, and prayed aloud.
And presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found Denys kneeling quiet beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands
across his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bosom after the custom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nation, and a face as long as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arm. When they rose, Gerard's countenance was beaming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Denys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Heaven will reward thy piety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, bah! I did it out of politeness,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Frenchman</b></font>)</div>said the Frenchman. <div class="bookquote">``It was to
please thee, little one. C’est egal, `twas well and orderly prayed, and
edified me to the core while it lasted. A bishop had scarce handled the
matter better; so now our evensong being sung, and the saints enlisted
with us--marchons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ere they had taken two steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stopped. <div class="bookquote">``By-the-by, the cub!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right. It is late. We have lost time climbing trees, and
tumbling off `em, and swooning, and vomiting, and praying; and the brute
is heavy to carry. And now I think on't, we shall have papa after it
next; these bears make such a coil about an odd cub. What is this? you
are wounded! you are wounded!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is wounded; miserable that I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be calm, Denys. I am not touched; I feel no pain anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You? you only feel when another is hurt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys, with great
emotion; and throwing himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) knees, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) examined Gerard's leg
with glistening eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick! quick! before it stiffens,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried, and hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who makes the coil about nothing now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>inquired Gerard composedly.

<p/>Denys's reply was a very indirect one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be pleased to note,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I have a bad heart. You were man
enough to save my life, yet I must sneer at you, a novice in war. Was
not I a novice once myself? Then you fainted from a wound, and I thought
you swooned for fear, and called you a milksop. Briefly, I have a bad
tongue and a bad heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Denys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plait-il?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You lie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good to say so, little one, and I am eternally obliged to
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>mumbled the remorseful Denys.

<p/>Ere they had walked many furlongs, the muscles of the wounded leg
contracted and stiffened, till presently Gerard could only just put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
toe to the ground, and that with great pain.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could bear it no longer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me lie down and die,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) groaned, <div class="bookquote">``for this is intolerable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys represented that it was afternoon, and the nights were now frosty;
and cold and hunger ill companions; and that it would be unreasonable
to lose heart, a certain great personage being notoriously defunct. So
Gerard leaned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) axe, and hobbled on; but presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gave in,
all of a sudden, and sank helpless in the road.

<p/>Denys drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) aside into the wood, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) surprise gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
crossbow and bolts, enjoining him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) strictly to lie quiet, and if any
ill-looking fellows should find him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) out and come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), to bid them
keep aloof; and should they refuse, to shoot them dead at twenty paces.
<div class="bookquote">``Honest men keep the path; and, knaves in a wood, none but fools do
parley with them.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With this he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) snatched up Gerard's axe, and set off
running--not, as Gerard expected, towards Dusseldorf, but on the road
they had come.

<p/>Gerard lay aching and smarting; and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) Rome, that seemed so near at
starting, looked far, far off, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was two hundred miles nearer
it. But soon all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thoughts turned Sevenbergen-wards. How sweet it
would be one day to hold Margaret's hand, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) all he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had gone
through for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)! The very thought of it, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); and in
the midst of pain and irritation of the nerves be lay resigned, and
sweetly, though faintly, smiling.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had lain thus more than two hours, when suddenly there were shouts;
and the next moment something struck a tree hard by, and quivered in it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked, it was an arrow.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) started to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feet. Several missiles rattled among the boughs, and
the wood echoed with battle-cries. Whence they came he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could not tell,
for noises in these huge woods are so reverberated, that a stranger
is always at fault as to their whereabout; but they seemed to fill
the whole air. Presently there was a lull; then he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) heard the fierce
galloping of hoofs; and still louder shouts and cries arose, mingled
with shrieks and groans; and above all, strange and terrible sounds,
like fierce claps of thunder, bellowing loud, and then dying off in
cracking echoes; and red tongues of flame shot out ever and anon among
the trees, and clouds of sulphurous smoke came drifting over his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head.
And all was still.

<p/>Gerard was struck with awe. <div class="bookquote">``What will become of Denys?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
why did you leave me? Oh, Denys, my friend! my friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Just before sunset Denys returned, almost sinking under a hairy bundle.
It was the bear's skin.

<p/>Gerard welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with a burst of joy that astonished him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought never to see you again, dear Denys. Were you in the battle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. What battle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The bloody battle of men, or fiends, that raged in the wood a while
agone;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and with this he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) described it to the life, and more fully than I
have done.

<p/>Denys patted him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) indulgently on the back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>); ``thou art a good limner; and fever is a great
spur to the imagination. One day I lay in a cart-shed with a cracked
skull, and saw two hosts manoeuvre and fight a good hour on eight feet
square, the which I did fairly describe to my comrade in due order, only
not so gorgeously as thou, for want of book learning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, then, you believe me not? when I tell you the arrows whizzed over
my head, and the combatants shouted, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May the foul fiends fly away with me if I believe a word of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arm, and quietly pointed to a tree close by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it looks like--it is-a broad arrow, as I live!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went close,
and looked up at it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It came out of the battle. I heard it, and saw it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An English arrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How know you that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry, by its length. The English bowmen draw the bow to the ear,
others only to the right breast. Hence the English loose a three-foot
shaft, and this is one of them, perdition seize them! Well, if this is
not glamour, there has been a trifle of a battle. And if there has been
a battle in so ridiculous a place for a battle as this, why then `tis
no business of mine, for my Duke hath no quarrel hereabouts. So let's to
bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the professional. And with this he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) scraped together a heap of
leaves, and made Gerard lie on it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) axe by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then lay down
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), with one hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arbalest, and drew the bear-skin over
them, hair inward. They were soon as warm as toast, and fast asleep.

<p/>But long before the dawn Gerard woke his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) comrade.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I do, Denys, I die of famine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do? why, go to sleep again incontinent: qui dort dine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I tell you I am too hungry to sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>snapped Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us march, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>replied Denys, with paternal indulgence.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had a brief paroxysm of yawns; then made a small bundle of bears'
ears, rolling them up in a strip of the skin, cut for the purpose; and
they took the road.

<p/>Gerard leaned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) axe, and propped by Denys on the other side,
hobbled along, not without sighs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate pain.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard viciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Therein you show judgment,''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>replied papa smoothly.

<p/>It was a clear starlight night; and soon the moon rising revealed the
end of the wood at no great distance: a pleasant sight, since Dusseldorf
they knew was but a short league further.

<p/>At the edge of the wood they came upon something so mysterious that they
stopped to gaze at it, before going up to it. Two white pillars rose
in the air, distant a few paces from each other; and between them stood
many figures, that looked like human forms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I go no farther till I know what this is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, in an agitated
whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Are they effigies of the saints, for men to pray to on the
road? or live robbers waiting to shoot down honest travellers? Nay,
living men they cannot be, for they stand on nothing that I see. Oh!
Denys, let us turn back till daybreak; this is no mortal sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys halted, and peered long and keenly. <div class="bookquote">``They are men,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), at
last. Gerard was for turning back all the more. <div class="bookquote">``But men that will never
hurt us, nor we them. Look not to their feet, for that they stand on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where, then, i' the name of all the saints?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look over their heads,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys gravely.

<p/>Following this direction, Gerard presently discerned the outline of
a dark wooden beam passing from pillar to pillar; and as the pair got
nearer, walking now on tiptoe, one by one dark snake-like cords came out
in the moonlight, each pendent from the beam to a dead man, and tight as
wire.

<p/>Now as they came under this awful monument of crime and wholesale
vengeance a light air swept by, and several of the corpses swung, or
gently gyrated, and every rope creaked. Gerard shuddered at this ghastly
salute. So thoroughly had the gibbet, with its sickening load, seized
and held their eyes, that it was but now they perceived a fire right
underneath, and a living figure sitting huddled over it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) axe lay
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), the bright blade shining red in the glow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was asleep.

<p/>Gerard started, but Denys only whispered, <div class="bookquote">``courage, comrade, here is a
fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! but there is a man at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There will soon be three;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) began to heap some wood on it that
the watcher had prepared; during which the prudent Gerard seized the
man's axe, and sat down tight on it, grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own, and examining the
sleeper. There was nothing outwardly distinctive in the man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore the
dress of the country folk, and the hat of the district, a three-cornered
hat called a Brunswicker, stiff enough to turn a sword cut, and with a
thick brass hat-band. The weight of the whole thing had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears
entirely down, like a fancy rabbit's in our century; but even this,
though it spoiled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a man, was nothing remarkable. They had of late
met scores of these dog's-eared rustics. The peculiarity was, this clown
watching under a laden gallows. What for?

<p/>Denys, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) felt curious, would not show it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) took out two bears'
ears from his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) bundle, and running sticks through them, began to toast
them. ```Twill be eating coined money,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``for the burgomaster
of Dusseldorf had given us a rix-dollar for these ears, as proving the
death of their owners; but better a lean purse than a lere stomach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unhappy man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``could you eat food here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where the fire is lighted there must the meat roast, and where it
roasts there must it be eaten; for nought travels worse than your
roasted meat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, eat thou, Denys, an thou canst! but I am cold and sick; there is
no room for hunger in my heart after what mine eyes have seen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
shuddered over the fire. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! how they creak! and who is this man, I
wonder? what an ill-favoured churl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys examined him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) like a connoisseur looking at a picture, and in
due course delivered judgment. ``I take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be of the refuse of that
company, whereof these -LRB-pointing carelessly upward-RRB- were the cream, and
so ran their heads into danger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At that rate, why not stun him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wakes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>and Gerard fidgeted
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat.

<p/>Denys opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) eyes with humorous surprise. <div class="bookquote">``For one who sets up for
a milksop you have the readiest hand. Why should two stun one? tush! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wakes: note now what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says at waking, and tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the watcher</b></font>)</div><p/>These last words were hardly whispered when the watcher opened his (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>) eyes.
At sight of the fire made up, and two strangers eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>) keenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>)
stared, and there was a severe and pretty successful effort to be calm;
still a perceptible tremor ran all over him (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>). Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>) manned himself,
and said gruffly. ``Good morrow. But at the very moment of saying it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
missed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) axe, and saw how Gerard was sitting upon it, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own
laid ready to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lost countenance again directly. Denys smiled
grimly at this bit of byplay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard quietly, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>The watcher was now too ill at ease to be silent. <div class="bookquote">``You make free with
my fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added in a somewhat faltering voice, <div class="bookquote">``you are
welcome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys whispered Gerard. The watcher eyed them askant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My comrade says, sith we share your fire, you shall share his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) meat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man warmly. <div class="bookquote">``I have half a kid hanging on a bush
hard by, I'll go fetch it;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arose with a cheerful and obliging
countenance, and was retiring.

<p/>Denys caught up his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) crossbow, and levelled it at his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) head. The man fell
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees.

<p/>Denys lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) weapon, and pointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) rose and
went back slowly and unsteadily, like one disjointed; and sick at heart
as the mouse, that the cat lets go a little way, and then darts and
replaces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys grimly, in French.

<p/>The man obeyed finger and tone, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) knew not a word of French.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the fire is not big enough for more than thee. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will take my
meaning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>This being communicated by Gerard, the man grinned; ever since Denys
spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had seemed greatly relieved. <div class="bookquote">``I wist not ye were strangers,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) to Gerard.

<p/>Denys cut a piece of bear's ear, and offered it with grace to him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had
just levelled crossbow at.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) took it calmly, and drew a piece of bread from his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) wallet, and
divided it with the pair. Nay, more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) winked and thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hand into
the heap of leaves he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sat on -LRB-Gerard grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) axe ready to brain him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)-RRB-
and produced a leathern bottle holding full two gallons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) put it to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mouth, and drank their healths, then handed it to Gerard; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) passed
it untouched to Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mort de ma vie!''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>cried the soldier, <div class="bookquote">``it is Rhenish wine, and fit
for the gullet of an archbishop. Here's to thee, thou prince of good
fellows, wishing thee a short life and a merry one! Come, Gerard, sup!
sup! Pshaw, never heed them, man! they heed not thee. Natheless, did I
hang over such a skin of Rhenish as this, and three churls sat beneath a
drinking it and offered me not a drop, I'd soon be down among them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Denys! Denys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My spirit would cut the cord, and womp would come my body amongst ye,
with a hand on the bottle, and one eye winking, t'other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard started up with a cry of horror and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fingers to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ears, and
was running from the place, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eye fell on the watcher's axe. The
tangible danger brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat down again on the axe with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, l’ami, le diable est mort!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>shouted Denys gaily, and offered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) a piece of bear's ear, put it right under his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) nose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
ears. Gerard turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head away with loathing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wine!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Heaven knows I have much need of it, with such
companions as thee and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took a long draught of the Rhenish wine: it ran glowing through his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
veins, and warmed and strengthened his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart, but could not check his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
tremors whenever a gust of wind came. As for Denys and the other, they
feasted recklessly, and plied the bottle unceasingly, and drank healths
and caroused beneath that creaking sepulchre and its ghastly tenants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) how they came here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mouth full, and
pointing up without looking.

<p/>On this question being interpreted to the watcher, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) replied that
treason had been their end, diabolical treason and priest-craft. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
then, being rendered communicative by drink, delivered a long prosy
narrative, the purport of which was as follows. These honest gentlemen
who now dangled here so miserably were all stout men and true, and
lived in the forest by their wits. Their independence and thriving state
excited the jealousy and hatred of a large portion of mankind, and many
attempts were made on their lives and liberties; these the Virgin and
their patron saints, coupled with their individual skill and courage
constantly baffled. But yester eve a party of merchants came slowly on
their mules from Dusseldorf. The honest men saw them crawling, and let
them penetrate near a league into the forest, then set upon them to
make them disgorge a portion of their ill-gotten gains. But alas!
the merchants were no merchants at all, but soldiers of more than one
nation, in the pay of the Archbishop of Cologne; haubergeons had they
beneath their gowns, and weapons of all sorts at hand; natheless, the
honest men fought stoutly, and pressed the traitors hard, when lo!
horsemen, that had been planted in ambush many hours before, galloped
up, and with these new diabolical engines of war, shot leaden bullets,
and laid many an honest fellow low, and so quelled the courage of others
that they yielded them prisoners. These being taken red-handed, the
victors, who with malice inconceivable had brought cords knotted round
their waists, did speedily hang, and by their side the dead ones, to
make the gallanter show. <div class="bookquote">``That one at the end was the captain. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) never
felt the cord. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was riddled with broad arrows and leaden balls or ever
they could take him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>): a worthy man as ever cried, `Stand and deliver!'
but a little hasty, not much: stay! I forgot; he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) is dead. Very hasty,
and obstinate as a pig. That one in the--buff jerkin is the lieutenant,
as good a soul as ever lived: he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) was hanged alive. This one here, I
never could abide; no -LRB-not that one; that is Conrad, my bosom friend-RRB-; I
mean this one right overhead in the chicken-toed shoon; you were always
carrying tales, ye thief, and making mischief; you know you were; and,
sirs, I am a man that would rather live united in a coppice than in a
forest with backbiters and tale-bearers: strangers, I drink to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went down the whole string, indicating with the neck of the
bottle, like a showman with his (<font color='blue'><b>showman</b></font>) pole, and giving a neat description of
each, which though pithy was invariably false; for the showman had no
real eye for character, and had misunderstood every one of these people.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough palaver!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys. <div class="bookquote">``Marchons! Give me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) axe: now tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must help you along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man's countenance fell, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw in Denys's eye that resistance
would be dangerous; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) submitted. Gerard it was who objected. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Y pensez-vous? to put my hand on a thief, it maketh my flesh creep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Childishness! all trades must live. Besides, I have my reasons. Be not
you wiser than your elder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Only if I am to lean on him (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) I must have my hand in my bosom, still
grasping the haft of my knife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a new attitude to walk in; but please thyself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trio</b></font>)</div><p/>And in that strange and mixed attitude of tender offices and deadly
suspicion the trio did walk. I wish I could draw them--I would not trust
to the pen.

<p/>The light of the watch-tower at Dusseldorf was visible as soon as they
cleared the wood, and cheered Gerard. When, after an hour's march, the
black outline of the tower itself and other buildings stood out clear to
the eye, their companion halted and said gloomily, <div class="bookquote">``You may as well slay
me out of hand as take me any nearer the gates of Dusseldorf town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>On this being communicated to Denys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) said at once, <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) go then,
for in sooth his (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) neck will be in jeopardy if he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) wends much further with
us.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Gerard acquiesced as a matter of course. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) horror of a criminal
did not in the least dispose him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to active co-operation with the law.
But the fact is, that at this epoch no private citizen in any part
of Europe ever meddled with criminals but in self-defence, except,
by-the-by, in England, which, behind other nations in some things, was
centuries before them all in this.

<p/>The man's personal liberty being restored, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) axe. It was
given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). To the friends' surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still lingered. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have
nothing for coming so far out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way with them?

<p/>``Here are two batzen, friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Add the wine, the good Rhenish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you give aught for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! the peril of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum! what say you, Denys?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say it was worth its weight in gold. Here, lad, here be silver
groshen, one for every acorn on that gallows tree; and here is one more
for thee, who wilt doubtless be there in due season.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man took the coins, but still lingered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! what now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, who thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shamefully overpaid
already. <div class="bookquote">``Dost seek the hide off our bones?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, good sirs, but you have seen to-night how parlous a life is mine.
Ye be true men, and your prayers avail; give me then a small trifle of a
prayer, an't please you; for I know not one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard's choler began to rise at the egotistical rogue; moreover, ever
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wound he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had felt gusts of irritability. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
lip and said, <div class="bookquote">``There go two words to that bargain; tell me first, is it
true what men say of you Rhenish thieves, that ye do murder innocent and
unresisting travellers as well as rob them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div><p/>The other answered sulkily, <div class="bookquote">``They you call thieves are not to blame for
that; the fault lies with the law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gramercy! so `tis the law's fault that ill men break it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean not so; but the law in this land slays an honest man an if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
do but steal. What follows? he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be pitiful, but is discouraged
herefrom; pity gains him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no pity, and doubles his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peril: an he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but cut
a purse his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life is forfeit; therefore cutteth he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the throat to boot, to
save his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own neck: dead men tell no tales. Pray then for the poor soul
who by bloody laws is driven to kill or else be slaughtered; were there
less of this unreasonable gibbeting on the highroad, there should be
less enforced cutting of throats in dark woods, my masters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fewer words had served,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>replied Gerard coldly. <div class="bookquote">``I asked a question, I
am answered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dei</b></font>)</div>and suddenly doffing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bonnet--

<p/>```Obsecro Deum omnipotentem, ut, qua cruce jam pendent isti quindecim
latrones fures et homicidae, in ea homicida fur et latro tu pependeris
quam citissime, pro publica salute, in honorem justi Dei cui sit gloria,
in aeternum, Amen.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so good day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The outlaw</b></font>)</div><p/>The greedy outlaw was satisfied last. <div class="bookquote">``That is Latin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) muttered, <div class="bookquote">``and
more than I bargained for.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So indeed it was.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) business with a mind at ease. The friends
pondered in silence the many events of the last few hours.

<p/>At last Gerard said thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``That she-bear saved both our lives-by
God's will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>replied Denys; <div class="bookquote">``and talking of that, it was lucky we did
not dawdle over our supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What mean you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean they are not all hanged; I saw a refuse of seven or eight as
black as ink around our fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When? when?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ere we had left it five minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! and you said not a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would but have worried you, and had set our friend a looking back,
and mayhap tempted him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to get his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) skull split. All other danger was
over; they could not see us, we were out of the moonshine, and indeed,
just turning a corner. Ah! there is the sun; and here are the gates of
Dusseldorf. Courage, l’ami, le diable est mort!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My head! my head!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>was all poor Gerard could reply.

<p/>So many shocks, emotions, perils, horrors, added to the wound, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
first, had tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) youthful body and sensitive nature too severely.


<p/>It was noon of the same day.

<p/>In a bedroom of <div class="bookquote">``The Silver Lion''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>the rugged Denys sat anxious, watching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) young friend.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) lay raging with fever, delirious at intervals, and one word for
ever on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret!--Margaret Margaret!''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVI

<p/>It was the afternoon of the next day. Gerard was no longer lightheaded,
but very irritable and full of fancies; and in one of these he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) begged
Denys to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a lemon to suck. Denys, who from a rough soldier had
been turned by tender friendship into a kind of grandfather, got up
hastily, and bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mind at ease, <div class="bookquote">``lemons he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) should have in
the twinkling of a quart pot,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>went and ransacked the shops for them.

<p/>They were not so common in the North as they are now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was absent
a long while, and Gerard getting very impatient, when at last the door
opened. But it was not Denys. Entered softly an imposing figure; an old
gentleman in a long sober gown trimmed with rich fur, cherry-coloured
hose, and pointed shoes, with a sword by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) side in a morocco scabbard,
a ruff round his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) neck not only starched severely, but treacherously
stiffened in furrows by rebatoes, or a little hidden framework of wood;
and on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head a four-cornered cap with a fur border; on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chin and
bosom a majestic white beard. Gerard was in no doubt as to the vocation
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) visitor, for, the sword excepted, this was familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) as the
full dress of a physician. Moreover, a boy followed at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heels with
a basket, where phials, lint, and surgical tools rather courted than
shunned observation. The old gentleman came softly to the bedside, and
said mildly and sotto voce, <div class="bookquote">``How is't with thee, my son?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard answered gratefully that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wound gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) little pain now; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) throat was parched, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head heavy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A wound! they told me not of that. Let me see it. Ay, ay, a good clean
bite. The mastiff had sound teeth that took this out, I warrant me;''
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>and the good doctor's sympathy seemed to run off to the quadruped he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had
conjured, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) jackal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This must be cauterized forthwith, or we shall have you starting back
from water, and turning somersaults in bed under our hands. `Tis the
year for raving curs, and one hath done your business; but we will
baffle him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) yet. Urchin, go heat thine iron.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>edged in Gerard, ```twas no dog, but a bear.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A bear! Young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the senior severely, <div class="bookquote">``think what you
say; `tis ill jesting with the man of art who brings his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grey hairs and
long study to heal you. A bear, quotha! Had you dissected as many bears
as I, or the tithe, and drawn their teeth to keep your hand in, you
would know that no bear's jaw ever made this foolish trifling wound. I
tell you `twas a dog, and since you put me to it, I even deny that it
was a dog of magnitude, but neither more nor less than one of these
little furious curs that are so rife, and run devious, biting each manly
leg, and laying its wearer low, but for me and my learned brethren, who
still stay the mischief with knife and cautery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, sir! when said I `twas a bear's jaw? I said, `A bear:' it was his (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>)
paw, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why didst not tell me that at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you kept telling me instead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never conceal aught from your leech, young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the listeners</b></font>)</div>continued the senior,
who was a good talker, but one of the worst listeners in Europe. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
it is an ill business. All the horny excrescences of animals, to wit,
claws of tigers, panthers, badgers, cats, bears, and the like, and
horn of deer, and nails of humans, especially children, are imbued with
direst poison. Y’had better have been bitten by a cur, whatever you may
say, than gored by bull or stag, or scratched by bear. However, shalt
have a good biting cataplasm for thy leg; meantime keep we the
body cool: put out thy tongue!-good!-fever. Let me feel thy pulse:
good!--fever. I ordain flebotomy, and on the instant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Flebotomy! that is bloodletting: humph! Well, no matter, if `tis sure
to cure me, for I will not lie idle here.''  (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>The doctor let him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) know that
flebotomy was infallible, especially in this case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hans, go fetch the things needful, and I will entertain the patient
meantime with reasons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man of art then explained to Gerard that in disease the blood
becomes hot and distempered and more or less poisonous; but a portion of
this unhealthy liquid removed, Nature is fain to create a purer fluid to
fill its place. Bleeding, therefore, being both a cooler and a purifier,
was a specific in all diseases, for all diseases were febrile, whatever
empirics might say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) warmly, <div class="bookquote">``that it suffices to bleed; any paltry
barber can open a vein -LRB-though not all can close it again-RRB-. The art is
to know what vein to empty for what disease. T’other day they brought me
one tormented with earache. I let him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) blood in the right thigh, and away
flew his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) earache. By-the-by, he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) has died since then. Another came with
the toothache. I bled him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) behind the ear, and relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) in a jiffy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) is also since dead as it happens. I bled our bailiff between the
thumb and forefinger for rheumatism. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) comes to me with
a headache and drumming in the ears, and holds out his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) hand over the
basin; but I smiled at his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) folly, and bled him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) in the left ankle sore
against his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) will, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) head as light as a nut.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Diverging then from the immediate theme after the manner of enthusiasts,
the reverend teacher proceeded thus:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Know, young man, that two schools of art contend at this moment
throughout Europe. The Arabian, whose ancient oracles are Avicenna,
Rhazes, Albucazis; and its revivers are Chauliac and Lanfranc; and
the Greek school, whose modern champions are Bessarion, Platinus, and
Marsilius Ficinus, but whose pristine doctors were medicine's very
oracles, Phoebus, Chiron, Aesculapius, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sons Podalinus and
Machaon, Pythagoras, Democritus, Praxagoras, who invented the arteries,
and Dioctes, `qui primus urinae animum dedit.' All these taught orally.
Then came Hippocrates, the eighteenth from Aesculapius, and of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) we
have manuscripts; to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) we owe `the vital principle.' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also invented
the bandage, and tapped for water on the chest; and above all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
dissected; yet only quadrupeds, for the brutal prejudices of the pagan
vulgar withheld the human body from the knife of science. Him (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>) followed
Aristotle, who gave us the aorta, the largest blood-vessel in the human
body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the reverend teacher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, sir, the Almighty gave us all that is in our bodies, and not
Aristotle, nor any Grecian man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>objected Gerard humbly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Child! of course He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave us the thing; but Aristotle did more, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave
us the name of the thing. But young men will still be talking. The
next great light was Galen; he (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) studied at Alexandria, then the home
of science. He (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>), justly malcontent with quadrupeds, dissected apes, as
coming nearer to man, and bled like a Trojan. Then came Theophilus, who
gave us the nerves, the lacteal vessels, and the pia mater.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>This worried Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot lie still and hear it said that mortal
man bestowed the parts which Adam our father took from Him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), who made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
of the clay, and us his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was ever such perversity?''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) colour rising. <div class="bookquote">``Who is
the real donor of a thing to man? he (<font color='blue'><b>donor</b></font>) who plants it secretly in the
dark recesses of man's body, or the learned wight who reveals it to
his (<font color='blue'><b>wight</b></font>) intelligence, and so enriches his (<font color='blue'><b>wight</b></font>) mind with the knowledge of it?
Comprehension is your only true possession. Are you answered?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am put to silence, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that is better still; for garrulous patients are ill to cure,
especially in fever; I say, then, that Eristratus gave us the cerebral
nerves and the milk vessels; nay, more, he (<font color='blue'><b>wight</b></font>) was the inventor of
lithotomy, whatever you may say. Then came another whom I forget; you do
somewhat perturb me with your petty exceptions. Then came Ammonius, the
author of lithotrity, and here comes Hans with the basin-to stay your
volubility. Blow thy chafer, boy, and hand me the basin; `tis well.
Arabians, quotha! What are they but a sect of yesterday who about the
year 1000 did fall in with the writings of those very Greeks, and read
them awry, having no concurrent light of their own? for their demigod,
and camel-driver, Mahound, impostor in science as in religion, had
strictly forbidden them anatomy, even of the lower animals, the which he (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>)
who severeth from medicine, `tollit solem e mundo,' as Tully quoth. Nay,
wonder not at my fervour, good youth; where the general weal stands in
jeopardy, a little warmth is civic, humane, and honourable. Now there is
settled of late in this town a pestilent Arabist, a mere empiric,
who, despising anatomy, and scarce knowing Greek from Hebrew, hath yet
spirited away half my patients; and I tremble for the rest. Put forth
thine ankle; and thou, Hans, breathe on the chafer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Whilst matters were in this posture, in came Denys with the lemons, and
stood surprised. <div class="bookquote">``What sport is toward?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), raising his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brows.

<p/>Gerard coloured a little, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) the learned doctor was going to
flebotomize him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) and cauterize him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); that was all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! indeed; and yon imp, what bloweth he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) hot coals for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What should it be for,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor to Gerard, ``but to cauterize
the vein when opened and the poisonous blood let free? `Tis the only
safe way. Avicenna indeed recommends a ligature of the vein; but how
`tis to be done he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) saith not, nor knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) himself I wot, nor any of the
spawn of Ishmael. For me, I have no faith in such tricksy expedients;
and take this with you for a safe principle: `Whatever an Arab or
Arabist says is right, must be wrong.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I see now what `tis for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys; <div class="bookquote">``and art thou so simple as
to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) put hot iron to thy living flesh? didst ever keep thy little
finger but ten moments in a candle? and this will be as many minutes.
Art not content to burn in purgatory after thy death? must thou needs
buy a foretaste on't here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard gravely; <div class="bookquote">``the good doctor spake
not of burning, but of cautery; to be sure `tis all one, but cautery
sounds not so fearful as burning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Imbecile! That is their art; to confound a plain man with dark words,
till his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hissing flesh lets him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know their meaning. Now listen to what
I have seen. When a soldier bleeds from a wound in battle, these leeches
say, `Fever. Blood him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)!' and so they burn the wick at t'other end too.
They bleed the bled. Now at fever's heels comes desperate weakness; then
the man needs all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blood to live; but these prickers and burners,
having no forethought, recking nought of what is sure to come in a few
hours, and seeing like brute beasts only what is under their noses,
having meantime robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of the very blood his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hurt had spared him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
battle that weakness withal; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dies exhausted. Hundreds have I
seen so scratched and pricked out of the world, Gerard, and tall fellows
too; but lo! if they have the luck to be wounded where no doctor can
be had, then they live; this too have I seen. Had I ever outlived that
field in Brabant but for my most lucky mischance, lack of chirurgery?
The frost chocked all my bleeding wounds, and so I lived. A chirurgeon
had pricked yet one more hole in this my body with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lance, and
drained my last drop out, and my spirit with it. Seeing them thus
distraught in bleeding of the bleeding soldier, I place no trust in
them; for what slays a veteran may well lay a milk-and-water bourgeois
low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This sounds like common sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>sighed Gerard languidly, <div class="bookquote">``but no
need to raise your voice so; I was not born deaf, and just now I hear
acutely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Common sense! very common sense indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the listener</b></font>)</div>shouted the bad listener;
<div class="bookquote">``why, this is a soldier; a brute whose business is to kill men, not cure
them.''  (<font color='red'><b>the listener</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added in very tolerable French, <div class="bookquote">``Woe be to you, unlearned
man, if you come between a physician and his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) patient; and woe be to you,
misguided youth, if you listen to that man of blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much obliged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, with mock politeness; <div class="bookquote">``but I am a true man,
and would rob no man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name. I do somewhat in the way of blood, but
not worth mention in this presence. For one I slay, you slay a score;
and for one spoonful of blood I draw, you spill a tubful. The world is
still gulled by shows. We soldiers vapour with long swords, and even in
war be-get two foes for every one we kill; but you smooth gownsmen, with
soft phrases and bare bodkins, `tis you that thin mankind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sick chamber is no place for jesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>cried the physician.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, doctor, nor for bawling,''  (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div>said the patient peevishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the senior kindly, ``be reasonable. Cuilibet
in sua arte credendum est.. My whole life has been given to this art. I
studied at Montpelier; the first school in France, and by consequence in
Europe. There learned I Dririmancy, Scatomancy, Pathology, Therapeusis,
and, greater than them all, Anatomy. For there we disciples of
Hippocrates and Galen had opportunities those great ancients never knew.
Goodbye, quadrupeds and apes, and paganism, and Mohammedanism; we bought
of the churchwardens, we shook the gallows; we undid the sexton's work
of dark nights, penetrated with love of science and our kind; all the
authorities had their orders from Paris to wink; and they winked. Gods
of Olympus, how they winked! The gracious king assisted us: he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sent us
twice a year a living criminal condemned to die, and said, `Deal ye with
him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) as science asks; dissect him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) alive, if ye think fit.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the liver of Herod, and Nero's bowels, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>)'ll make me blush for the

top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) voice.

<p/>Gerard gave a little squawk, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ears; but
speedily drew them out and shouted angrily, and as loudly, <div class="bookquote">``you great
roaring, blaspheming bull of Basan, hold your noisy tongue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys summoned a contrite look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tush, slight man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, with calm contempt, and vibrated
a hand over him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) as in this age men make a pointer dog down charge; then
flowed majestic on. <div class="bookquote">``We seldom or never dissected the living criminal,
except in part. We mostly inoculated them with such diseases as the
barren time afforded, selecting of course the more interesting ones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That means the foulest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>whispered Denys meekly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These we watched through all their stages to maturity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meaning the death of the poor rogue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>whispered Denys meekly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, my poor sufferer, who best merits your confidence, this
honest soldier with his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) youth, his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) ignorance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) prejudices, or a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of a good bloodhound,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``What, art thou so

with leprosy; I but bled him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) at the tip of the nose. I cured last year
a quartan ague: how? bled its forefinger. Our cure lost his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) memory. I
brought it him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) back on the point of my lance; I bled him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) behind the
ear. I bled a dolt of a boy, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is the only one who can tell his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
right hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left in a whole family of idiots. When the plague
was here years ago, no sham plague, such as empyrics proclaim every six
years or so, but the good honest Byzantine pest, I blooded an alderman
freely, and cauterized the symptomatic buboes, and so pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) out
of the grave; whereas our then chirurgeon, a most pernicious Arabist,
caught it himself, and died of it, aha, calling on Rhazes, Avicenna,
and Mahound, who, could they have come, had all perished as miserably as
himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my poor ears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>sighed Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And am I fallen so low that one of your presence and speech rejects my
art and listens to a rude soldier, so far behind even his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) own miserable
trade as to bear an arbalest, a worn-out invention, that German
children shoot at pigeons with, but German soldiers mock at since ever
arquebusses came and put them down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You foul-mouthed old charlatan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys, <div class="bookquote">``the arbalest is
shouldered by taller men than ever stood in Rhenish hose, and even now
it kills as many more than your noisy, stinking arquebus, as the lancet
does than all our toys together. Go to! He (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) was no fool who first called
you `leeches.' Sang-sues! va!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard groaned. ``By the holy virgin, I wish you were both at Jericho,
bellowing.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you comrade. Then I'll bark no more, but at need I'll bite. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) has a lance, I have a sword; if he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) bleeds you, I'll bleed him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>). The
moment his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) lance pricks your skin, little one, my sword-hilt knocks
against his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) ribs; I have said it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>And Denys turned pale, folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) arms, and looked gloomy and dangerous.

<p/>Gerard sighed wearily. <div class="bookquote">``Now, as all this is about me, give me leave to
say a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! let the young man choose life or death for himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard then indirectly rebuked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) noisy counsellors by contrast and
example. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) spoke with unparalleled calmness, sweetness, and gentleness.
And these were the words of Gerard the son of Eli. <div class="bookquote">``I doubt not you both
mean me well; but you assassinate me between you. Calmness and quiet are
everything to me; but you are like two dogs growling over a bone. And
in sooth, bone I should be, did this uproar last long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a dead silence, broken only by the silvery voice of Gerard,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lay tranquil, and gazed calmly at the ceiling, and trickled into
words.

<p/>``First, venerable sir, I thank you for coming to see me, whether from
humanity, or in the way of honest gain; all trades must live.

<p/>``Your learning, reverend sir, seems great, to me at least, and for your
experience, your age voucheth it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say you have bled many, and of these many, many have not died
thereafter, but lived, and done well. I must needs believe you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The physician</b></font>)</div><p/>The physician bowed; Denys grunted.

<p/>``Others, you say, you have bled, and-they are dead. I must needs believe
you.

<p/>``Denys knows few things compared with you, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) knows them well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) is
a man not given to conjecture. This I myself have noted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) has
seen the fevered and blooded for the most part die; the fevered and not
blooded live. I must needs believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).

<p/>``Here, then, all is doubt.

<p/>``But thus much is certain; if I be bled, I must pay you a fee, and be
burnt and excruciated with a hot iron, who am no felon.

<p/>``Pay a certain price in money and anguish for a doubtful remedy, that
will I never.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Next to money and ease, peace and quiet are certain goods, above all in
a sick-room; but `twould seem men cannot argue medicine without heat and
raised voices; therefore, sir, I will essay a little sleep, and Denys
will go forth and gaze on the females of the place, and I will keep
you no longer from those who can afford to lay out blood and money in
flebotomy and cautery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The physician</b></font>)</div><p/>The old physician had naturally a hot temper; he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had often during this
battle of words mastered it with difficulty, and now it mastered him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).
The most dignified course was silence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) saw this, and drew himself up,
and made loftily for the door, followed close by his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) little boy and big
basket.

<p/>But at the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) choked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) swelled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) burst. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) whirled and came
back open-mouthed, and the little boy and big basket had to
whisk semicircularly not to be run down, for de minimis non curat
Medicina-even when not in a rage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you reject my skill, you scorn my art. My revenge shall be to leave
you to yourself; lost idiot, take your last look at me, and at the sun.
Your blood be on your head!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And away he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stamped.

<p/>But on reaching the door he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whirled and came back; his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wicker tail
twirling round after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) like a cat's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In twelve hours at furthest you will be in the secondary stage of
fever. Your head will split. Your carotids will thump. Aha! And let but
a pin fall, you will jump to the ceiling. Then send for me; and I'll not
come.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) departed. But at the door-handle gathered fury, wheeled and
came flying, with pale, terror-stricken boy and wicker tail whisking
after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). ``Next will come--CRAMPS of the STOMACH. Aha!

<p/>``Then--BILIOUS VOMIT. Aha!

<p/>``Then--COLD SWEAT, and DEADLY STUPOR.

<p/>``Then--CONFUSION OF ALL THE SENSES.

<p/>``Then--BLOODY VOMIT.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And after that nothing can save you, not even I; and if I could I would
not, and so farewell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Even Denys changed colour at threats so fervent and precise; but Gerard
only gnashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) teeth with rage at the noise, and seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hard
bolster with kindling eye.

<p/>This added fuel to the fire, and brought the insulted ancient back from
the impassable door, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) whisking train.

<p/>``And after that--MADNESS!

<p/>``And after that--BLACK VOMIT

<p/>``And then--CONVULSIONS!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then--THAT CESSATION OF ALL VITAL FUNCTIONS THE VULGAR CALL
`DEATH,' for which thank your own Satanic folly and insolence.
Farewell.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) roared, <div class="bookquote">``And think not to be buried in
any Christian church-yard; for the bailiff is my good friend, and I
shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) how and why you died: felo de se! felo de se! Farewell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feet on the bed by some supernatural gymnastic
power excitement lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) so moved, the vindictive
orator came back at him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) fiercer than ever, to launch some master-threat
the world has unhappily lost; for as he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) came with his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) whisking train,
and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) fist, Gerard hurled the bolster furiously in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face
and knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) down like a shot, the boy's head cracked under his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
falling master's, and crash went the dumb-stricken orator into the
basket, and there sat wedged in an inverted angle, crushing phial
after phial. The boy, being light, was strewed afar, but in a squatting
posture; so that they sat in a sequence, like graduated specimens, the
smaller howling. But soon the doctor's face filled with horror, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
uttered a far louder and unearthly screech, and kicked and struggled
with wonderful agility for one of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) age.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was sitting on the hot coals.

<p/>They had singed the cloth and were now biting the man. Struggling wildly
but vainly to get out of the basket, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rolled yelling over with it
sideways, and lo! a great hissing; then the humane Gerard ran and
wrenched off the tight basket not without a struggle. The doctor lay on
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face groaning, handsomely singed with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own chafer, and slaked a
moment too late by his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own villainous compounds, which, however, being
as various and even beautiful in colour as they were odious in taste,
had strangely diversified his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) grey robe, and painted it more gaudy than
neat.

<p/>Gerard and Denys raised him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) up and consoled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Courage, man, `tis
but cautery; balm of Gilead, why, you recommend it but now to my comrade
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The physician</b></font>)</div><p/>The physician replied only by a look of concentrated spite, and went out
in dead silence, thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stomach forth before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in the drollest
way. The boy followed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) next moment but in that slight interval he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
left off whining, burst into a grin, and conveyed to the culprits by an
unrefined gesture his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) accurate comprehension of, and rapturous though
compressed joy at, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) master's disaster.



<p/>CHAPTER XXVII

<p/>THE worthy physician went home and told his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) housekeeper he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) was in agony
from <div class="bookquote">``a bad burn.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Those were the words. For in phlogistic as in other
things, we cauterize our neighbour's digits, but burn our own fingers.
His (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) housekeeper applied some old women's remedy mild as milk. He (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>)
submitted like a lamb to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) experience: his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) sole object in the case
of this patient being cure: meantime he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) made out his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) bill for broken
phials, and took measures to have the travellers imprisoned at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>)
made oath before a magistrate that they, being strangers and indebted to
him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>), meditated instant flight from the township.

<p/>Alas! it was his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) unlucky day. His (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) sincere desire and honest endeavour to
perjure himself were baffled by a circumstance he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) had never foreseen nor
indeed thought possible.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) had spoken the truth.

<p/>And IN AN AFFIDAVIT!

<p/>The officers, on reaching <div class="bookquote">``The Silver Lion'' (<font color='red'><b>The officers</b></font>)</div>, found the birds were flown.

<p/>They went down to the river, and from intelligence they received there,
started up the bank in hot pursuit.

<p/>This temporary escape the friends owed to Denys's good sense and
observation. After a peal of laughter, that it was a cordial to hear,
and after venting his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) watchword three times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) turned short grave, and
told Gerard Dusseldorf was no place for them. <div class="bookquote">``That old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``went off unnaturally silent for such a babbler: we are strangers
here; the bailiff is his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) friend: in five minutes we shall lie in a
dungeon for assaulting a Dusseldorf dignity, are you strong enough to
hobble to the water's edge? it is hard by. Once there you have but to
lie down in a boat instead of a bed; and what is the odds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The odds, Denys? untold, and all in favour of the boat. I pine for
Rome; for Rome is my road to Sevenbergen; and then we shall lie in the
boat, but ON the Rhine, the famous Rhine; the cool, refreshing Rhine.
I feel its breezes coming: the very sight will cure a little
hop-'o-my-thumb fever like mine; away! away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) excitable friend in this mood, Denys settled hastily with
the landlord, and they hurried to the river. On inquiry they found to
their dismay that the public boat was gone this half hour, and no other
would start that day, being afternoon. By dint, however, of asking a
great many questions, and collecting a crowd, they obtained an offer of
a private boat from an old man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two sons.

<p/>This was duly ridiculed by a bystander. <div class="bookquote">``The current is too strong for
three oars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then my comrade and I will help row,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the invalid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No need,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``Bless your silly heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) owns t'other
boat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a powerful breeze right astern; the boatmen set a broad sail,
and rowing also, went off at a spanking rate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are ye better, lad, for the river breeze?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much better. But indeed the doctor did me good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The doctor? Why, you would none of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but I mean--you will say I am nought--but knocking the old fool
down--somehow--it soothed me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amiable dove! how thy little character opens more and more every day,
like a rosebud. I read thee all wrong at first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Denys, mistake me not, neither. I trust I had borne with his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) idle
threats, though in sooth his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) voice went through my poor ears; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was
an infidel, or next door to one, and such I have been taught to abhor.
Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) not as good as say, we owed our inward parts to men with long
Greek names, and not to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), whose name is but a syllable, but whose
hand is over all the earth? Pagan!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) down forthwith--like a good Christian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Denys, you will still be jesting. Take not an ill man's part. Had
it been a thunderbolt from Heaven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had met but his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) due; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) took
but a sorry bolster from this weak arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What weak arm?''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>inquired Denys, with twinkling eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I have lived
among arms, and by Samson's hairy pow never saw I one more like a
catapult. The bolster wrapped round his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) nose and the two ends kissed
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) forehead resounded, and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) been Goliath,
or Julius Caesar, instead of an old quacksalver, down he (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) had gone. St.
Denys guard me from such feeble opposites as thou! and above all from
their weak arms--thou diabolical young hypocrite.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The river took many turns, and this sometimes brought the wind on their
side instead of right astern. Then they all moved to the weather side
to prevent the boat heeling over too much all but a child of about five
years old, the grandson of the boatman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) darling; this urchin
had slipped on board at the moment of starting, and being too light
to affect the boat's trim, was above, or rather below, the laws of
navigation.

<p/>They sailed merrily on, little conscious that they were pursued by a
whole posse of constables armed with the bailiff's writ, and that their
pursuers were coming up with them; for if the wind was strong, so was
the current.

<p/>And now Gerard suddenly remembered that this was a very good way to
Rome, but not to Burgundy. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Denys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), with an almost alarmed
look, <div class="bookquote">``this is not your road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys quietly; <div class="bookquote">``but what can I do? I cannot leave thee
till the fever leaves thee; and it is on thee still, for thou art
both red and white by turns; I have watched thee. I must e'en go on to
Cologne, I doubt, and then strike across.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank Heaven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard joyfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) added eagerly, with a little
touch of self-deception, ```Twere a sin to be so near Cologne and not see
it. Oh, man, it is a vast and ancient city such as I have often dreamed
of, but ne’er had the good luck to see. Me miserable, by what hard
fortune do I come to it now? Well then, Denys,'' continued the young man
less warmly, <div class="bookquote">``it is old enough to have been founded by a Roman lady
in the first century of grace, and sacked by Attila the barbarous, and
afterwards sore defaced by the Norman Lothaire. And it has a church
for every week in the year forbye chapels and churches innumerable
of convents and nunneries, and above all, the stupendous minster yet
unfinished, and therein, but in their own chapel, lie the three kings
that brought gifts to our Lord, Melchior gold, and Gaspar frankincense,
and Balthazar the black king, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) brought myrrh; and over their bones
stands the shrine the wonder of the world; it is of ever-shining brass
brighter than gold, studded with images fairly wrought, and inlaid with
exquisite devices, and brave with colours; and two broad stripes run to
and fro, of jewels so great, so rare, each might adorn a crown or
ransom its wearer at need; and upon it stand the three kings curiously
counterfeited, two in solid silver, richly gilt; these be bareheaded;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of Aethiop ebony, and beareth a golden crown; and in the midst
our blessed Lady, in virgin silver, with Christ in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) arms; and at the
corners, in golden branches, four goodly waxen tapers do burn night and
day. Holy eyes have watched and renewed that light unceasingly for
ages, and holy eyes shall watch them in saecula. I tell thee, Denys, the
oldest song, the oldest Flemish or German legend, found them burning,
and they shall light the earth to its grave. And there is St. Ursel's
church, a British saint's, where lie her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) bones and all the other virgins
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) fellows; eleven thousand were they who died for the faith, being put
to the sword by barbarous Moors, on the twenty-third day of October, two
hundred and thirty-eight. Their bones are piled in the vaults, and many
of their skulls are in the church. St. Ursel's is in a thin golden case,
and stands on the high altar, but shown to humble Christians only on
solemn days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eleven thousand virgins!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys. <div class="bookquote">``What babies German men must
have been in days of yore. Well, would all their bones might turn flesh
again, and their skulls sweet faces, as we pass through the gates. `Tis
odds but some of them are wearied of their estate by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tush, Denys!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard; <div class="bookquote">``why wilt thou, being good, still make
thyself seem evil? If thy wishing-cap be on, pray that we may meet the
meanest she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) of all those wise virgins in the next world, and to that

church of the Maccabees, and the cauldron in which they and their

flesh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, peremptory king! and pig-headed Maccabees! I had eaten bacon with

<p/>At this juncture one of the younger boatmen suddenly inquired what was
amiss with <div class="bookquote">``little turnip-face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boatmen</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) young nephew thus described had just come aft grave as a judge, and
burst out crying in the midst without more ado. On this phenomenon,
so sharply defined, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was subjected to many interrogatories, some
coaxingly uttered, some not. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hurt himself? had he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) over-ate
himself? was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) frightened? was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cold? was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sick? was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) an idiot?

<p/>To all and each he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) uttered the same reply, which English writers render
thus, oh! oh! oh! and French writers thus, hi! hi! hi! So fixed are
Fiction's phonetics.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can tell what ails the peevish brat?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boatman</b></font>)</div>snarled the young boatman
impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Rather look this way and tell me whom be these after!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man son</b></font>)</div>The old man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) other son looked, and saw four men walking along
the east bank of the river; at the sight they left rowing awhile, and
gathered mysteriously in the stern, whispering and casting glances
alternately at their passengers and the pedestrians.

<p/>The sequel may show they would have employed speculation better in
trying to fathom the turnip-face mystery; I beg pardon of my age: I mean
the deep mind of dauntless infancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If `tis as I doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>whispered one of the young men, <div class="bookquote">``why not give them
a squeak for their lives; let us make for the west bank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man objected stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``run our heads into
trouble for strangers! are ye mad? Nay, let us rather cross to the east
side; still side with the strong arm! that is my rede. What say you,
Werter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, please yourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div><p/>What age and youth could not decide upon, a puff of wind settled most
impartially. Came a squall, and the little vessel heeled over; the men
jumped to windward to trim her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but to their horror they saw in the very
boat from stem to stern a ditch of water rushing to leeward, and the
next moment they saw nothing, but felt the Rhine, the cold and rushing
Rhine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turnip-face''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had drawn the plug.

<p/>The officers unwound the cords from their waists.

<p/>Gerard could swim like a duck; but the best swimmer, canted out of a
boat capsized, must sink ere he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) can swim. The dark water bubbled loudly
over his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) head, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) came up almost blind and deaf for a moment;
the next, he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) saw the black boat bottom uppermost, and figures clinging
to it; he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) head like a water-dog, and made for it by a sort of
unthinking imitation; but ere he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) reached it he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) heard a voice behind him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>)
cry not loud but with deep manly distress, <div class="bookquote">``Adieu, comrade, adieu!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) looked, and there was poor Denys sinking, sinking, weighed down by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) wretched arbalest. His (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) face was pale, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) eyes staring wide,
and turned despairingly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) dear friend. Gerard uttered a wild cry
of love and terror, and made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), cleaving the water madly; but the
next moment Denys was under water.

<p/>The next, Gerard was after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>The officers knotted a rope and threw the end in.



<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII

<p/>Things good and evil balance themselves in a remarkable manner and
almost universally. The steel bow attached to the arbalestrier's back,
and carried above his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head, had sunk him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). That very steel bow, owing
to that very position, could not escape Gerard's hands, one of which
grasped it, and the other went between the bow and the cord, which was
as good. The next moment, Denys, by means of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) crossbow, was hoisted
with so eager a jerk that half his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) body bobbed up out of water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, grip me not! grip me not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, in mortal terror of that
fatal mistake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pas si bete,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>gurgled Denys.

<p/>Seeing the sort of stuff he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had to deal with, Gerard was hopeful and
calm directly. <div class="bookquote">``On thy back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sharply, and seizing the arbalest,
and taking a stroke forward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) aided the desired movement. <div class="bookquote">``Hand on
my shoulder! slap the water with the other hand! No--with a downward
motion; so. Do nothing more than I bid thee.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>Gerard had got hold of
Denys's long hair, and twisting it hard, caught the end between his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) side
teeth, and with the strong muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) youthful neck easily kept up
the soldier's head, and struck out lustily across the current. A moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had hesitated which side to make for, little knowing the awful
importance of that simple decision; then seeing the west bank a trifle
nearest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) made towards it, instead of swimming to jail like a good
boy, and so furnishing one a novel incident. Owing to the force of the
current they slanted considerably, and when they had covered near a
hundred yards, Denys murmured uneasily, <div class="bookquote">``How much more of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>mumbled Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever a duck knows, a Dutchman knows; art
safe as in bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The next moment, to their surprise, they found themselves in shallow
water, and so waded ashore. Once on terra firma, they looked at one
another from head to foot as if eyes could devour, then by one impulse
flung each an arm round the other's neck, and panted there with hearts
too full to speak. And at this sacred moment life was sweet as heaven to
both; sweetest perhaps to the poor exiled lover, who had just saved his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
friend. Oh, joy to whose height what poet has yet soared, or ever tried
to soar? To save a human life; and that life a loved one. Such moments
are worth living for, ay, three score years and ten. And then, calmer,
they took hands, and so walked along the bank hand in hand like a pair
of sweethearts, scarce knowing or caring whither they went.

<p/>The boat people were all safe on the late concave, now convex craft,
Herr Turnip-face, the <div class="bookquote">``Inverter of things,''  (<font color='red'><b>The boat people</b></font>)</div>being in the middle. All
this fracas seemed not to have essentially deranged his (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) habits. At least
he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) was greeting when he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) shot our friends into the Rhine, and greeting
when they got out again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we wait till they right the boat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Denys, our fare is paid; we owe them nought. Let us on, and
briskly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys assented, observing that they could walk all the way to Cologne on
this bank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fare not to Cologne,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the calm reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, whither then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Burgundy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Burgundy? Ah, no! that is too good to be sooth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sooth `tis, and sense into the bargain. What matters it to me how I go
to Rome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Nay, nay; you but say so to pleasure me. The change is too sudden; and
think me not so ill-hearted as take you at your word. Also did I not see
your eyes sparkle at the wonders of Cologne? the churches, the images,
the relics

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dull art thou, Denys; that was when we were to enjoy them together.
Churches! I shall see plenty, go Rome-ward how I will. The bones of
saints and martyrs; alas! the world is full of them; but a friend like
thee, where on earth's face shall I find another? No, I will not turn
thee farther from the road that leads to thy dear home, and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that
pines for thee. Neither will I rob myself of thee by leaving thee. Since
I drew thee out of Rhine I love thee better than I did. Thou art my
pearl: I fished thee; and must keep thee. So gainsay me not, or thou
wilt bring back my fever; but cry courage, and lead on; and hey for
Burgundy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys gave a joyful caper. <div class="bookquote">``Courage! va pour la Bourgogne. Oh! soyes
tranquille! cette fois il est bien decidement mort, ce coquin-la.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And
they turned their backs on the Rhine.

<p/>On this decision making itself clear, across the Rhine there was a
commotion in the little party that had been watching the discussion, and
the friends had not taken many steps ere a voice came to them over the
water. <div class="bookquote">``HALT!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard turned, and saw one of those four holding out a badge of office
and a parchment slip. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart sank; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was a good citizen, and
used to obey the voice that now bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turn again to Dusseldorf--the
Law's.

<p/>Denys did not share his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) scruples. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was a Frenchman, and despised every
other nation, laws, inmates, and customs included. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was a soldier,
and took a military view of the situation. Superior force opposed; river
between; rear open; why, `twas retreat made easy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) saw at a glance
that the boat still drifted in mid-stream, and there was no ferry nearer
than Dusseldorf. <div class="bookquote">``I shall beat a quick retreat to that hill,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``and then, being out of sight, quick step.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They sauntered off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halt! in the bailiff's name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried a voice from the shore.

<p/>Denys turned round and ostentatiously snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) fingers at the
bailiff, and proceeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halt! in the archbishop's name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) fingers at his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) grace, and proceeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halt! in the emperor's name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) fingers at his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) majesty, and proceeded.

<p/>Gerard saw this needless pantomime with regret, and as soon as they had
passed the brow of the hill, said, <div class="bookquote">``There is now but one course, we must
run to Burgundy instead of walking;''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) set off, and ran the best
part of a league without stopping.

<p/>Denys was fairly blown, and inquired what on earth had become of
Gerard's fever. <div class="bookquote">``I begin to miss it sadly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) drily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dropped it in Rhine, I trow,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply.

<p/>Presently they came to a little village, and here Denys purchased a loaf
and a huge bottle of Rhenish wine. <div class="bookquote">``For,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we must sleep in
some hole or corner. If we lie at an inn, we shall be taken in our
beds.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This was no more than common prudence on the old soldier's part.

<p/>The official network for catching law-breakers, especially plebeian
ones, was very close in that age; though the co-operation of the public
was almost null, at all events upon the Continent. The innkeepers were
everywhere under close surveillance as to their travellers, for whose
acts they were even in some degree responsible, more so it would seem
than for their sufferings.

<p/>The friends were both glad when the sun set; and delighted, when, after
a long trudge under the stars -LRB-for the moon, if I remember right, did
not rise till about three in the morning-RRB- they came to a large barn
belonging to a house at some distance. A quantity of barley had been
lately thrashed; for the heap of straw on one side the thrashing-floor
was almost as high as the unthrashed corn on the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here be two royal beds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys; <div class="bookquote">``which shall we lie on, the mow,
or the straw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The straw for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/>They sat on the heap, and ate their brown bread, and drank their wine,
and then Denys covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) friend up in straw, and heaped it high above
him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) only a breathing hole: <div class="bookquote">``Water, they say, is death to
fevered men; I'll make warm water on't, anyhow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) make his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mind easy. <div class="bookquote">``These few drops from Rhine cannot
chill me. I feel heat enough in my body now to parch a kennel, or boil a
cloud if I was in one.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And with this epigram his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) consciousness went so
rapidly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) might really be said to <div class="bookquote">``fall asleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys, who lay awake awhile, heard that which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) nestle closer.
Horses' hoofs came ringing up from Dusseldorf, and the wooden barn
vibrated as they rattled past howling in a manner too well known and
understood in the 15th century, but as unfamiliar in Europe now as a red
Indian's war-whoop.

<p/>Denys shook where he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) lay.

<p/>Gerard slept like a top.

<p/>It all swept by, and troop and howls died away.

<p/>The stout soldier drew a long breath, whistled in a whisper, closed his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
eyes, and slept like a top, too.

<p/>In the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) sat up and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) hand to wake Gerard. It lighted
on the young man's forehead, and found it quite wet. Denys then in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
quality of nurse forbore to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is ill to check sleep or sweat
in a sick man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I know that far, though I ne’er minced ape nor
gallows-bird.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After waiting a good hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) felt desperately hungry; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) turned, and
in self-defence went to sleep again.

<p/>Poor fellow, in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hard life he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been often driven to this
manoeuvre. At high noon he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was waked by Gerard moving, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
sitting up with the straw smoking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) like a dung-hill. Animal
heat versus moisture. Gerard called him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``a lazy loon.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) quietly
grinned.

<p/>They set out, and the first thing Denys did was to give Gerard his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
arbalest, etc., and mount a high tree on the road. <div class="bookquote">``Coast clear to the
next village,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and on they went.

<p/>On drawing near the village, Denys halted and suddenly inquired of
Gerard how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) felt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! can you not see? I feel as if Rome was no further than yon
hamlet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But thy body, lad; thy skin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither hot nor cold; and yesterday `twas hot one while and cold
another. But what I cannot get rid of is this tiresome leg.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Le grand malheur! Many of my comrades have found no such difficulty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! there it goes again; itches consumedly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unhappy youth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``the sum of thy troubles is this:
thy fever is gone, and thy wound is--healing. Sith so it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
indulgently, <div class="bookquote">``I shall tell thee a little piece of news I had otherwise
withheld.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is't?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>asked Gerard, sparkling with curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THE HUE AND CRY IS OUT AFTER US: AND ON FLEET HORSES.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXIX

<p/>Gerard was staggered by this sudden communication, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) colour came
and went. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) teeth with ire. For men of any spirit
at all are like the wild boar; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will run from a superior force, owing
perhaps to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) not being an ass; but if you stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heels too long
and too close, and, in short, bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will whirl, and come tearing
at a multitude of hunters, and perhaps bore you. Gerard then set his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
teeth and looked battle, But the next moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) countenance fell, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said plaintively, <div class="bookquote">``And my axe is in Rhine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They consulted together. Prudence bade them avoid that village; hunger
said <div class="bookquote">``buy food.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Prudence</b></font>)</div><p/>Hunger spoke loudest. Prudence most convincingly. They settled to strike
across the fields.

<p/>They halted at a haystack and borrowed two bundles of hay, and lay on
them in a dry ditch out of sight, but in nettles.

<p/>They sallied out in turn and came back with turnips. These they munched
at intervals in their retreat until sunset.

<p/>Presently they crept out shivering into the rain and darkness, and got
into the road on the other side of the village.

<p/>It was a dismal night, dark as pitch, and blowing hard. They could
neither see, nor hear, nor be seen, nor heard; and for aught I know,
passed like ghosts close to their foes. These they almost forgot in the
natural horrors of the black tempestuous night, in which they seemed to
grope and hew their way as in black marble. When the moon rose they were
many a league from Dusseldorf. But they still trudged on. Presently they
came to a huge building.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys, <div class="bookquote">``I think I know this convent. Aye it is. We are
in the see of Juliers. Cologne has no power here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>The next moment they were safe within the walls.



<p/>CHAPTER XXX

<p/>Here Gerard made acquaintance with a monk, who had constructed the
great dial in the prior's garden, and a wheel for drawing water, and
a winnowing machine for the grain, etc., and had ever some ingenious
mechanism on hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had made several psalteries and two dulcimers, and
was now attempting a set of regalles, or little organ for the choir.

<p/>Now Gerard played the humble psaltery a little; but the monk touched
that instrument divinely, and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) most agreeably what a novice
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was in music. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) also illuminated finely, but could not write so
beautifully as Gerard. Comparing their acquirements with the earnestness
and simplicity of an age in which accomplishments implied a true natural
bent, Youth and Age soon became like brothers, and Gerard was pressed
hard to stay that night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) consulted Denys, who assented with a rueful
shrug.

<p/>Gerard told his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) old new friend whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was going, and described their
late adventures, softening down the bolster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man traveller</b></font>)</div>said the good old man, <div class="bookquote">``I have been a great traveller in my
day, but none molested me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man traveller</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to avoid inns; they were
always haunted by rogues and roysterers, whence his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul might take harm
even did his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body escape, and to manage each day's journey so as to lie
at some peaceful monastery; then suddenly breaking off and looking as
sharp as a needle at Gerard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) how long since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been
shriven? Gerard coloured up and replied feebly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better than a fortnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And thou an exorcist! No wonder perils have overtaken thee. Come, thou
must be assoiled out of hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``and with all mine heart;''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>and was sinking
down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands joined, but the monk stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) half
fretfully--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to me! not to me! not to me! I am as full of the world as thou or
any be that lives in't. My whole soul it is in these wooden pipes, and
sorry leathern stops, which shall perish--with them whose minds are
fixed on such like vanities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``they are for the use of the Church, and
surely that sanctifies the pains and labour spent on them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is just what the devil has been whispering in mine ear this
while,''  (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div>said the monk, putting one hand behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) back and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
finger half threateningly, half playfully, at Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was even so
kind and thoughtful as to mind me that Solomon built the Lord a house
with rare hangings, and that this in him (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) was counted gracious and no
sin. Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) can quote Scripture rarely. But I am not so simple a monk
as you think, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>cried the good father, with sudden defiance,
addressing not Gerard but--Vacancy. <div class="bookquote">``This one toy finished, vigils,
fasts, and prayers for me; prayers standing, prayers lying on the chapel
floor, and prayers in a right good tub of cold water.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nudged Gerard
and winked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eye knowingly. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hates and dreads like seeing
us monks at our orisons up to our chins in cold water. For corpus domat
aqua. So now go confess thy little trumpery sins, pardonable in youth
and secularity, and leave me to mine, sweet to me as honey, and to be
expiated in proportion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head, but could not help saying, <div class="bookquote">``Where shall I find a
confessor more holy and clement?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In each of these cells,''  (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div>replied the monk simply -LRB-they were now in the
corridor-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``there, go to Brother Anselm, yonder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard followed the monk's direction, and made for a cell; but the doors
were pretty close to one another, and it seems he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mistook; for just
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was about to tap, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) old friend crying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in an
agitated whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Nay! nay! nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned, and there was the monk
at his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) cell-door, in a strange state of anxiety, going up and down
and beating the air double-handed, like a bottom sawyer. Gerard really
thought the cell he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was at must be inhabited by some dangerous wild
beast, if not by that personage whose presence in the convent had been
so distinctly proclaimed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked back inquiringly and went on to the
next door. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) old friend nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head rapidly, bursting in a
moment into a comparatively blissful expression of face, and shot back
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) den. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hour-glass, turned it, and went to work on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
regalles; and often he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked up, and said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Well-a-day, the
sands how swift they run when the man is bent over earthly toys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Father Anselm was a venerable monk, with an ample head, and a face all
dignity and love. Therefore Gerard in confessing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and replying to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gentle though searching questions, could not help thinking, <div class="bookquote">``Here is
a head!--Oh dear! oh dear! I wonder whether you will let me draw it when
I have done confessing.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And so his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own head got confused, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) forgot
a crime or two. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did not lower the bolstering this time,
nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) so uncandid as to detract from the pagan character of the
bolstered.

<p/>The penance inflicted was this: he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was to enter the convent church, and
prostrating himself, kiss the lowest step of the altar three times;
then kneeling on the floor, to say three paternosters and a credo: <div class="bookquote">``this
done, come back to me on the instant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Accordingly, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) short mortification performed, Gerard returned, and
found Father Anselm spreading plaster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After the soul the body,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``know that I am the chirurgeon here,
for want of a better. This is going on thy leg; to cool it, not to burn
it; the saints forbid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>During the operation the monastic leech, who had naturally been
interested by the Dusseldorf branch of Gerard's confession, rather sided
with Denys upon <div class="bookquote">``bleeding.''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We Dominicans seldom let blood nowadays;
the lay leeches say `tis from timidity and want of skill; but, in sooth,
we have long found that simples will cure most of the ills that can
be cured at all. Besides, they never kill in capable hands; and other
remedies slay like thunderbolts. As for the blood, the Vulgate saith
expressly it is the life of a man.' And in medicine or law, as in
divinity, to be wiser than the All-wise is to be a fool. Moreover,
simples are mighty. The little four-footed creature that kills the
poisonous snake, if bitten herself, finds an herb powerful enough to
quell that poison, though stronger and of swifter operation than any
mortal malady; and we, taught by her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wisdom, and our own traditions,
still search and try the virtues of those plants the good God hath
strewed this earth with, some to feed men's bodies, some to heal them.
Only in desperate ills we mix heavenly with earthly virtue. We steep
the hair or the bones of some dead saint in the medicine, and thus work
marvellous cures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think you, father, it is along of the reliques? for Peter a Floris, a
learned leech and no pagan, denies it stoutly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What knows Peter a Floris? And what know I? I take not on me to say
we can command the saints, and will they nill they, can draw corporal
virtue from their blest remains. But I see that the patient drinking
thus in faith is often bettered as by a charm. Doubtless faith in the
recipient is for much in all these cures. But so `twas ever. A sick
woman, that all the Jewish leeches failed to cure, did but touch
Christ's garment and was healed in a moment. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not touched that
sacred piece of cloth she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never been healed. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) without faith
not touched it only, but worn it to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grave, I trow she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been none
the better for't. But we do ill to search these things too curiously.
All we see around us calls for faith. Have then a little patience.
We shall soon know all. Meantime, I, thy confessor for the nonce, do
strictly forbid thee, on thy soul's health, to hearken learned lay folk
on things religious. Arrogance is their bane; with it they shut heaven's
open door in their own faces. Mind, I say, learned laics. Unlearned ones
have often been my masters in humility, and may be thine. Thy wound is
cared for; in three days `twill be but a scar. And now God speed thee,
and the saints make thee as good and as happy as thou art thoughtful
and gracious.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>Gerard hoped there was no need to part yet, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was
to dine in the refectory. But Father Anselm told him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), with a shade of
regret just perceptible and no more, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) did not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cell this
week, being himself in penitence; and with this he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) took Gerard's head
delicately in both hands, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) on the brow, and almost before
the cell door had closed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), was back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) pious offices. Gerard
went away chilled to the heart by the isolation of the monastic life,
and saddened too. <div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``here is a kind face I must never
look to see again on earth; a kind voice gone from mine ear and my heart
for ever. There is nothing but meeting and parting in this sorrowful
world. Well-a-day! well-a-day!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This pensive mood was interrupted by
a young monk who came for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to the refectory; there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
found several monks seated at a table, and Denys standing like a poker,
being examined as to the towns he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) should pass through: the friars
then clubbed their knowledge, and marked out the route, noting all the
religious houses on or near that road; and this they gave Gerard. Then
supper, and after it the old monk carried Gerard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cell, and they
had an eager chat, and the friar incidentally revealed the cause of
his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) pantomime in the corridor. <div class="bookquote">``Ye had well-nigh fallen into Brother
Jerome's clutches. Yon was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) cell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Father Jerome an ill man, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An ill man!''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>and the friar crossed himself; <div class="bookquote">``a saint, an anchorite, the
very pillar of this house! He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) had sent ye barefoot to Loretto. Nay, I
forgot, y’are bound for Italy; the spiteful old saint upon earth, had
sent ye to Canterbury or Compostella. But Jerome was born old and with
a cowl; Anselm and I were boys once, and wicked beyond anything you
can imagine''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Gerard wore a somewhat incredulous look-RRB-: <div class="bookquote">``this keeps us
humble more or less, and makes us reasonably lenient to youth and hot
blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, at Gerard's earnest request, one more heavenly strain upon the
psalterion, and so to bed, the troubled spirit calmed, and the sore
heart soothed.


<p/>I have described in full this day, marked only by contrast, a day that
came like oil on waves after so many passions and perils--because it
must stand in this narrative as the representative of many such days
which now succeeded to it. For our travellers on their weary way
experienced that which most of my readers will find in the longer
journey of life, viz., that stirring events are not evenly distributed
over the whole road, but come by fits and starts, and as it were, in
clusters. To some extent this may be because they draw one another by
links more or less subtle. But there is more in it than that. It happens
so. Life is an intermittent fever. Now all narrators, whether of history
or fiction, are compelled to slur these barren portions of time or else
line trunks. The practice, however, tends to give the unguarded reader
a wrong arithmetical impression, which there is a particular reason
for avoiding in these pages as far as possible. I invite therefore your
intelligence to my aid, and ask you to try and realize that, although
there were no more vivid adventures for a long while, one day's march
succeeded another; one monastery after another fed and lodged them
gratis with a welcome always charitable, sometimes genial; and though
they met no enemy but winter and rough weather, antagonists not always
contemptible, yet they trudged over a much larger tract of territory
than that, their passage through which I have described so minutely. And
so the pair, Gerard bronzed in the face and travel-stained from head to
foot, and Denys with his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) shoes in tatters, stiff and footsore both of
them, drew near the Burgundian frontier.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXI

<p/>Gerard was almost as eager for this promised land as Denys; for the
latter constantly chanted its praises, and at every little annoyance
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``they did things better in Burgundy;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and above all played on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) foible by guaranteeing clean bedclothes at the inns of that polished
nation. <div class="bookquote">``I ask no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hollander</b></font>)</div>the Hollander would say; <div class="bookquote">``to think that I have
not lain once in a naked bed since I left home! When I look at their
linen, instead of doffing habit and hose, it is mine eyes and nose I
would fain be shut of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hollander</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) love of country so far as to walk twenty leagues in
shoes that had exploded, rather than buy of a German churl, who would
throw all manner of obstacles in a customer's way, his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) incivility, his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
dinner, his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) body.

<p/>Towards sunset they found themselves at equal distances from a little
town and a monastery, only the latter was off the road. Denys was for
the inn, Gerard for the convent. Denys gave way, but on condition that
once in Burgundy they should always stop at an inn. Gerard consented
to this the more readily that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) chart with its list of convents ended
here. So they turned off the road. And now Gerard asked with surprise
whence this sudden aversion to places that had fed and lodged them
gratis so often. The soldier hemmed and hawed at first, but at last his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
wrongs burst forth. It came out that this was no sudden aversion, but an
ancient and abiding horror, which he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had suppressed till now, but with
infinite difficulty, and out of politeness: <div class="bookquote">``I saw they had put powder
in your drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``so I forbore them. However, being the last,
why not ease my mind? Know then I have been like a fish out of water
in all those great dungeons. You straightway levant with some old
shaveling: so you see not my purgatory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me! I have been selfish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, I forgive thee, little one; `tis not thy fault: art not the
first fool that has been priest-rid, and monk-hit. But I'll not
forgive them my misery.''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>Then, about a century before Henry VIII.'s
commissioners, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) indictment. These gloomy piles were
all built alike. Inns differed, but here all was monotony. Great gate,
little gate, so many steps and then a gloomy cloister. Here the dortour,
there the great cold refectory, where you must sit mumchance, or at
least inaudible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) who liked to speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mind out; <div class="bookquote">``and then,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``nobody is a man here, but all are slaves, and of what? of a
peevish, tinkling bell, that never sleeps. An `twere a trumpet now, aye
sounding alarums, `twouldn't freeze a man's heart so. Tinkle, tinkle,
tinkle, and you must sit to meat with may be no stomach for food. Ere
your meat settles in your stomach, tinkle, tinkle! and ye must to church
with may be no stomach for devotion: I am not a hog at prayers, for one.
Tinkle, tinkle, and now you must to bed with your eyes open. Well, by
then you have contrived to shut them, some uneasy imp of darkness has
got to the bell-rope, and tinkle, tinkle, it behoves you say a prayer in
the dark, whether you know one or not. If they heard the sort of prayers
I mutter when they break my rest with their tinkle! Well, you drop off
again and get about an eyeful of sleep: lo, it is tinkle, tinkle, for
matins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the only clapper you love is a woman's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>put in Gerard half
contemptuously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because there is some music in that even when it scolds,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the stout
reply. <div class="bookquote">``And then to be always checked. If I do but put my finger in the
salt-cellar, straightway I hear, `Have you no knife that you finger the
salt?' And if I but wipe my knife on the cloth to save time, then `tis,
`Wipe thy knife dirty on the bread, and clean upon the cloth!' Oh small
of soul! these little peevish pedantries fall chill upon good fellowship
like wee icicles a-melting down from strawen eaves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hold cleanliness no pedantry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Shouldst learn better
manners once for all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At every other word, you mean; every obscene or blasphemous one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Exaggerator, go to! Why, at the very last of these dungeons I found the
poor travellers sitting all chilled and mute round one shaveling, like
rogues awaiting their turn to be hanged; so to cheer them up, I did but
cry out, `Courage, tout le monde, le dia--

Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wheel and wyte on me in a sort of Alsatian French, turning

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Being thyself unable to speak ten words of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) language without a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what said he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What signifies it what a fool says?''

then, it is just a custom?' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). I not divining the old fox, and
thinking to clear myself, said, `Ay, it was.' `Then that is ten times
worse,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). `'Twill bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) about your ears one of these days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)

for the tidings which neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) missals nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) breviary had ever let

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is't not true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True or not, it was ill manners,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>replied Denys guardedly. <div class="bookquote">``And so

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but, Denys, whether you hearken his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) rede, or slight it, wherefore

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard was staggered: ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could recover at this thunderbolt of
Gallicism, Denys went triumphant off at a tangent, and stigmatized all
monks as hypocrites. <div class="bookquote">``Do but look at them, how they creep about and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard eagerly, <div class="bookquote">``that modest downcast gaze is part of their

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>``Cussed toads eating hoc hac horum? No such thing; just so looks a
cut-purse. Can't meet a true man's eye. Doff cowl, monk; and behold,
a thief; don cowl thief, and lo, a monk. Tell me not they will ever be
able to look God Almighty in the face, when they can't even look a true
man in the face down here. Ah, here it is, black as ink! into the well
we go, comrade. Misericorde, there goes the tinkle already. `Tis the
best of tinkles though; `tis for dinner: stay, listen! I thought so: the
wolf in my stomach cried `Amen!''' This last statement he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) confirmed with
two oaths, and marched like a victorious gamecock into the convent,
thinking by Gerard's silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and not dreaming how
profoundly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had disgusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XXXII

<p/>In the refectory allusion was made, at the table where Gerard sat,
to the sudden death of the monk who had undertaken to write out fresh
copies of the charter of the monastery, and the rule, etc..

<p/>Gerard caught this, and timidly offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) services. There was a
hesitation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mistook. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, not for hire, my lords, but for love,
and as a trifling return for many a good night's lodging the brethren of
your order have bestowed on me a poor wayfarer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A monk</b></font>)</div><p/>A monk smiled approvingly; but hinted that the late brother was an
excellent penman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) work could not be continued but by a master.
Gerard on this drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wallet with some trepidation a vellum deed,
the back of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had cleaned and written upon by way of specimen.
The monk gave quite a start at sight of it, and very hastily went up
the hall to the high table, and bending his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) knee so as just to touch in
passing the fifth step and the tenth, or last, presented it to the prior
with comments. Instantly a dozen knowing eyes were fixed on it, and a
buzz of voices was heard; and soon Gerard saw the prior point more than
once, and the monk came back, looking as proud as Punch, with a savoury
crustade ryal, or game pie gravied and spiced, for Gerard, and a silver
grace cup full of rich pimentum. This latter Gerard took, and bowing
low, first to the distant prior, then to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own company, quaffed, and
circulated the cup.

<p/>Instantly, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) surprise, the whole table hailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) as a brother:
<div class="bookquote">``Art convent bred, deny it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>a brother</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) acknowledged it, and gave Heaven
thanks for it, for otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been as rude and ignorant as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
brothers, Sybrandt and Cornelis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But `tis passing strange how you could know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You drank with the cup in both hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>monks</b></font>)</div>said two monks, speaking
together.

<p/>The voices had for some time been loudish round a table at the bottom
of the hall; but presently came a burst of mirth so obstreperous and
prolonged, that the prior sent the very sub-prior all down the hall to
check it, and inflict penance on every monk at the table. And Gerard's
cheek burned with shame; for in the heart of the unruly merriment his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
ear had caught the word <div class="bookquote">``courage!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>and the trumpet tones of Denys of
Burgundy.

<p/>Soon Gerard was installed in feu Werter's cell, with wax lights, and a
little frame that could be set at any angle, and all the materials of
caligraphy. The work, however, was too much for one evening. Then came
the question, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ask Denys, the monk-hater, to stay longer?
However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and offered to abide by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) decision. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was
agreeably surprised when Denys said graciously, <div class="bookquote">``A day's rest will do
neither of us harm. Write thou, and I'll pass the time as I may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard's work was vastly admired; they agreed that the records of the
monastery had gained by poor Werter's death. The sub-prior forced a
rix-dollar on Gerard, and several brushes and colours out of the convent
stock, which was very large. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) march warm at heart, for
this was of good omen; since it was on the pen he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) relied to make
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fortune and recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) well-beloved. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Denys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
good-humouredly, ``see what the good monks have given me; now, do try to
be fairer to them; for to be round with you, it chilled my friendship
for a moment to hear even you call my benefactors `hypocrites.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I recant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you! thank you! Good Denys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was a scurrilous vagabond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, say not so, neither!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we soldiers are rude and hasty. I give myself the lie, and I offer
those I misunderstood all my esteem. `Tis unjust that thousands should
be defamed for the hypocrisy of a few.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now are you reasonable. You have pondered what I said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, it is their own doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard crowed a little, we all like to be proved in the right; and
was all attention when Denys offered to relate how his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) conversion was
effected.

<p/>``Well then, at dinner the first day a young monk beside me did open his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>)
jaws and laughed right out and most musically. `Good,' said I, `at last
I have fallen on a man and not a shorn ape.' So, to sound him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) further,
I slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) broad back and administered my consigne. `Heaven forbid!'
says he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>). I stared. For the dog looked as sad as Solomon; a better mime
saw you never, even at a Mystery. `I see war is no sharpener of the
wits,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>). `What are the clergy for but to fight the foul fiend?
and what else are the monks for?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fiend being dead,
The friars are sped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>monks</b></font>)</div><p/>You may plough up the convents, and we poor monks shall have nought to
do--but turn soldiers, and so bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) to life again.' Then there was a
great laugh at my expense. `Well, you are the monk for me,' said I. `And
you are the crossbowman for me,' quo' he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>). `And I'll be bound you could
tell us tales of the war should make our hair stand on end.' `Excusez!
the barber has put that out of the question,' quoth I, and then I had
the laugh.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What wretched ribaldry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>observed Gerard pensively.

<p/>The candid Denys at once admitted he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had seen merrier jests hatched with
less cackle. ```Twas a great matter to have got rid of hypocrisy. `So,'
said I, `I can give you the chaire de poule, if that may content ye.'
`That we will see,' was the cry, and a signal went round.''

<p/>Denys then related, bursting with glee, how at bedtime he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had been taken
to a cell instead of the great dortour, and strictly forbidden to sleep;
and to aid his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) vigil, a book had been lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) of pictures representing
a hundred merry adventures of monks in pursuit of the female laity;
and how in due course he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had been taken out barefooted and down to the
parlour, where was a supper fit for the duke, and at it twelve jolly
friars, the roaringest boys he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had ever met in peace or war. How the
story, the toast, the jest, the wine-cup had gone round, and some
had played cards with a gorgeous pack, where Saint Theresa, and Saint
Catherine, etc., bedizened with gold, stood for the four queens; and
black, white, grey, and crutched friars for the four knaves; and had
staked their very rosaries, swearing like troopers when they lost. And
how about midnight a sly monk had stolen out, but had by him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) and others
been as cannily followed into the garden, and seen to thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) hand
into the ivy and out with a rope-ladder. With this he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) had run up on
the wall, which was ten feet broad, yet not so nimbly but what a russet
kirtle had popped up from the outer world as quick as he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>); and so to
billing and cooing: that this situation had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) as rather feline
than ecclesiastical, and drawn from him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) the appropriate comment of a
<div class="bookquote">``mew!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The monks had joined the mewsical chorus, and the lay visitor
shrieked and been sore discomforted; but Abelard only cried, <div class="bookquote">``What, are
ye there, ye jealous miauling knaves? ye shall caterwaul to some tune
to-morrow night. I'll fit every man-jack of ye with a fardingale.''  (<font color='red'><b>Abelard</b></font>)</div>That
this brutal threat had reconciled him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to stay another day--at Gerard's
request.

<p/>Gerard groaned.

<p/>Meantime, unable to disconcert so brazen a monk, and the demoiselle
beginning to whimper, they had danced caterwauling in a circle, then
bestowed a solemn benediction on the two wall-flowers, and off to
the parlour, where they found a pair lying dead drunk, and other
two affectionate to tears. That they had straightway carried off the
inanimate, and dragged off the loving and lachymose, kicked them all
merrily each into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so shut up in measureless content.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard was disgusted: and said so.

<p/>Denys chuckled, and proceeded to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) how the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) and the
young monks had drawn the fish-ponds and secreted much pike, carp,
tench, and eel for their own use: and how, in the dead of night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had
been taken shoeless by crooked ways into the chapel, a ghost-like place,
being dark, and then down some steps into a crypt below the chapel
floor, where suddenly paradise had burst on him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).

<p/>```Tis there the holy fathers retire to pray,'' put in Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys; <div class="bookquote">``wax candles by the dozen were lighted, and
princely cheer; fifteen soups maigre, with marvellous twangs of venison,
grouse, and hare in them, and twenty different fishes -LRB-being Friday-RRB-,
cooked with wondrous art, and each he (<font color='blue'><b>knaves</b></font>) between two buxom lasses, and each
lass between two lads with a cowl; all but me: and to think I had to woo
by interpreter. I doubt the knave put in three words for himself and
one for me; if he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) didn't, hang him (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) for a fool. And some of the weaker
vessels were novices, and not wont to hold good wine; had to be coaxed
ere they would put it to their white teeth; mais elles s'y faisaient;
and the story, and the jest, and the cup went round -LRB-by-the-by, they had
flagons made to simulate breviaries-RRB-; and a monk touched the cittern,
and sang ditties with a voice tunable as a lark in spring. The posies
did turn the faces of the women folk bright red at first: but elles s'y
faisaient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Gerard exploded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miserable wretches! Corrupters of youth! Perverters of innocence! but
for your being there, Denys, who have been taught no better, oh,
would God the church had fallen on the whole gang. Impious, abominable
hypocrites!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hypocrites?''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys, with unfeigned surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Why, that is what I
clept them ere I knew them: and you withstood me. Nay, they are sinners;
all good fellows are that; but, by St. Denys his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) helmeted skull, no
hypocrites, but right jolly roaring blades.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Denys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``you little know the peril you ran that
night. That church you defiled amongst you is haunted; I had it from
one of the elder monks. The dead walk there, their light feet have been
heard to patter o’er the stones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Misericorde!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>whispered Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) voice almost to a whisper;
<div class="bookquote">``celestial sounds have issued from the purlieus of that very crypt you
turned into a tavern. Voices of the dead holding unearthly communion
have chilled the ear of midnight, and at times, Denys, the faithful in
their nightly watches have even heard music from dead lips; and chords,
made by no mortal finger, swept by no mortal hand, have rung faintly,
like echoes, deep among the dead in those sacred vaults.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys wore a look of dismay. <div class="bookquote">``Ugh! if I had known, mules and wain-ropes
had not hauled me thither; and so''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a sigh-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I had lost a merry
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Whether further discussion might have thrown any more light upon these
ghostly sounds, who can tell? for up came a <div class="bookquote">``bearded brother''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from the
monastery, spurring his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mule, and waving a piece of vellum in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hand.
It was the deed between Ghysbrecht and Floris Brandt. Gerard valued it
deeply as a remembrance of home: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned pale at first but to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
had so nearly lost it, and to Denys's infinite amusement not only gave a
piece of money to the lay brother, but kissed the mule's nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll read you now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``were you twice as ill written;
and--to make sure of never losing you'' (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>--here he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat down, and taking out
needle and thread, sewed it with feminine dexterity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) doublet, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mind, and heart, and soul were away to Sevenbergen.

<p/>They reached the promised land, and Denys, who was in high spirits,
doffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) bonnet to all the females; who curtsied and smiled in return;
fired his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) consigne at most of the men; at which some stared, some
grinned, some both; and finally landed his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) friend at one of the
long-promised Burgundian inns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a little one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but I know it of old for a good one;
Les Trois Poissons.' But what is this writ up? I mind not this;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
pointed to an inscription that ran across the whole building in a single
line of huge letters. ``Oh, I see. `Ici on loge a pied et a cheval,'''
said Denys, going minutely through the inscription, and looking
bumptious when he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had effected it.

<p/>Gerard did look, and the sentence in question ran thus:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``ON NE LOGE CEANS A CREDIT; CE BONHOMME EST MORT, LES MAUVAIS PAIEURS
L’ONT TUE.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXIII

<p/>They met the landlord in the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome, messieurs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) cap, with a low bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, we are not in Germany,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/>In the public room they found the mistress, a buxom woman of forty. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
curtsied to them, and smiled right cordially <div class="bookquote">``Give yourself the trouble
of sitting ye down, fair sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to Gerard, and dusted two chairs
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) apron, not that they needed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, dame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), ``this is a polite
nation: the trouble of sitting down? That will I with singular patience;
and presently the labour of eating, also the toil of digestion, and
finally, by Hercules his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) aid, the strain of going to bed, and the
struggle of sinking fast asleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Denys, what are you doing? ordering supper for only two?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, can we sup without waiting for forty more? Burgundy forever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha! Courage, camarade. Le dia--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``C’est convenu.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The salic law seemed not to have penetrated to French inns. In this one
at least wimple and kirtle reigned supreme; doublets and hose were few
in number, and feeble in act. The landlord himself wandered objectless,
eternally taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cap to folk for want of thought; and the women,
as they passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in turn, thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) quietly aside without looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), as we remove a live twig in bustling through a wood.

<p/>A maid brought in supper, and the mistress followed her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), empty handed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fall to, my masters,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) cheerily; <div class="bookquote">``y’have but one enemy here;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) lies under your knife.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I shrewdly suspect this of formula.-RRB-

<p/>They fell to. The mistress drew her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) chair a little toward the table; and
provided company as well as meat; gossiped genially with them like old
acquaintances: but this form gone through, the busy dame was soon off
and sent in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) daughter, a beautiful young woman of about twenty,
who took the vacant seat. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was not quite so broad and genial as the
elder, but gentle and cheerful, and showed a womanly tenderness for
Gerard on learning the distance the poor boy had come, and had to go.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) stayed nearly half-an-hour, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) left them Gerard said,
<div class="bookquote">``This an inn? Why, it is like home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Qui fit Francois il fit courtois,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, bursting with gratified
pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courteous? nay, Christian; to welcome us like home guests and old
friends, us vagrants, here to-day and gone to-morrow. But indeed who
better merits pity and kindness than the worn traveller far from his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>)
folk? Hola! here's another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The new-comer</b></font>)</div><p/>The new-comer was the chambermaid, a woman of about twenty-five, with
a cocked nose, a large laughing mouth, and a sparkling black eye, and a
bare arm very stout but not very shapely.

<p/>The moment she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came in, one of the travellers passed a somewhat free
jest on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); the next the whole company were roaring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) expense,
so swiftly had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) practised tongue done his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) business. Even as, in
a passage of arms between a novice and a master of fence, foils
clash--novice pinked. On this another, and then another, must break a
lance with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but Marion stuck her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) great arms upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) haunches, and
held the whole room in play. This country girl possessed in perfection
that rude and ready humour which looks mean and vulgar on paper, but
carries all before it spoken: not wit's rapier; its bludgeon. Nature had
done much for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in this way, and daily practice in an inn the rest.

<p/>Yet shall she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not be photographed by me, but feebly indicated: for it
was just four hundred years ago, the raillery was coarse, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) returned
every stroke in kind, and though a virtuous woman, said things without
winking, which no decent man of our day would say even among men.

<p/>Gerard sat gaping with astonishment. This was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) almost a new
variety of <div class="bookquote">``that interesting species,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>homo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) whispered ``Denys, Now
I see why you Frenchmen say `a woman's tongue is her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sword:''' just then
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) levelled another assailant; and the chivalrous Denys, to console
and support ``the weaker vessel,'' the iron kettle among the clay pots,
administered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) consigne, <div class="bookquote">``Courage, ma mie, le--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>etc..

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) directly. <div class="bookquote">``How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) be dead as long as there is an
archer left alive?''  (<font color='red'><b>General</b></font>)</div>-LRB-General laughter at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ally's expense.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is `washing day,' my masters,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), with sudden gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apres? We travellers cannot strip and go bare while you wash our
clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div>objected a peevish old fellow by the fireside, who had kept
mumchance during the raillery, but crept out into the sunshine of
commonplaces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I aimed not your way, ancient man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marion</b></font>)</div>replied Marion superciliously. <div class="bookquote">``But
since you ask me''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-here she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) scanned him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) slowly from head to foot-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I
trow you might take a turn in the tub, clothes and all, and no harm
done''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-laughter-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``But what I spoke for, I thought this young sire might
like his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) beard starched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Gerard's turn had come; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) chin crop was thin and silky.

<p/>The loudest of all the laughers this time was the traitor Denys, whose
beard was of a good length, and singularly stiff and bristly; so that
Shakespeare, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>), hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) in the bull's eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--As You Like It.

<p/>Gerard bore the Amazonian satire mighty calmly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had little personal
vanity. ``Nay, `chambriere,''' said he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>), with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``mine is all
unworthy your pains; take you this fair growth in hand!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pointed
to Denys's vegetable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, time for that, when I starch the besoms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>Whilst they were all shouting over this palpable hit, the mistress
returned, and in no more time than it took her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to cross the threshold,
did our Amazon turn to a seeming Madonna meek and mild.

<p/>Mistresses are wonderful subjugators. Their like I think breathes not
on the globe. Housemaids, decide! It was a waste of histrionic ability
though; for the landlady had heard, and did not at heart disapprove, the
peals of laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Marion, lass,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) good-humouredly, <div class="bookquote">``if you laid me an
egg every time you cackle, `L’es Trois Poissons' would never lack an
omelet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, dame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``what is to pay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Where is the hurry? cannot you be content to pay when you go? lose the
guest, find the money, is the rule of `The Three Fish.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, dame, outside `The Three Fish' it is thus written--`Ici-on ne
loge--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! Let that flea stick on the wall! Look hither,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) pointed
to the smoky ceiling, which was covered with hieroglyphics. These were
accounts, vulgo scores; intelligible to this dame and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) daughter, who
wrote them at need by simply mounting a low stool, and scratching with
a knife so as to show lines of ceiling through the deposit of smoke. The
dame explained that the writing on the wall was put there to frighten
moneyless folk from the inn altogether, or to be acted on at odd times
when a non-paying face should come in and insist on being served. <div class="bookquote">``We
can't refuse them plump, you know. The law forbids us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how know you mine is not such a face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out fie! it is the best face that has entered `The Three Fish' this
autumn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And mine, dame?''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys; <div class="bookquote">``dost see no knavery here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) calmly. <div class="bookquote">``Not such a good one as the lad's; nor ever will
be. But it is the face of a true man. For all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) drily,
<div class="bookquote">``an I were ten years younger, I'd as lieve not meet that face on a dark
night too far from home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard stared. Denys laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Why, dame, I would but sip the night dew
off the flower; and you needn't take ten years off, nor ten days, to be
worth risking a scratched face for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, our mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marion</b></font>)</div>said Marion, who had just come in, <div class="bookquote">``said I not
t'other day you could make a fool of them still, an if you were properly
minded?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say ye did; it sounds like some daft wench's speech.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``this is wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Oh! no, no, that is no wonder at all. Why, I have been here all
my life; and reading faces is the first thing a girl picks up in an
inn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marion</b></font>)</div><p/>Marion. <div class="bookquote">``And frying eggs the second; no, telling lies; frying eggs is
the third, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>The Mistress. <div class="bookquote">``And holding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tongue the last, and modesty the day
after never at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marion</b></font>)</div><p/>Marion. <div class="bookquote">``Alack! Talk of my tongue. But I say no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) under whose

Catch what's left on't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) staggered and sank backwards on to the
handsomest fellow in the room, which happened to be Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tic! tic!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) peevishly; <div class="bookquote">``there, don't be stupid! that is too

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Marion resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) elasticity with a grimace, made two little bounds
into the middle of the floor, and there turned a pirouette. <div class="bookquote">``There,

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>said the mistress, <div class="bookquote">``this girl is not so stupid as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not quite take me, dame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``That honesty in a face

insanity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) miserable mulierosity?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>Poor Gerard got angrier the more
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, `tis but the word I was fain to invent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Invent? What, can a child like you make other words than grow in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, dame, mulierose--that means wrapped up, body and soul,
in women. So prithee tell me; how did you ever detect the noodle's
mulierosity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! good youth, you make a mountain of a molehill. We that are women
be notice-takers; and out of the tail of our eye see more than most men
can, glaring through a prospect glass. Whiles I move to and fro doing
this and that, my glance is still on my guests, and I did notice that
this soldier's eyes were never off the womenfolk: my daughter, or
Marion, or even an old woman like me, all was gold to him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>): and there a
sat glowering; oh, you foolish, foolish man! Now you still turned to the
speaker, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) or him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), and that is common sense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys burst into a hoarse laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You never were more out. Why, this

in the whole bundle of ye, brown and fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Man alive, that is just the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hostess</b></font>)</div>said the hostess. <div class="bookquote">``Yourn is the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, they are all that till better acquainted. I'd as lieve have her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
no more than honest, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) will serve to keep you out of worse

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor of his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) pouch either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marion</b></font>)</div>said Marion, striking in, <div class="bookquote">``and his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) lips, they

 (<font color='red'><b>Marion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Overmuch clack! Marion overmuch clack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ods bodikins, mistress; ye didn't hire me to be one o' your three
fishes, did ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marion</b></font>)</div>and Marion sulked thirty seconds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that the way to speak to our mistress?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the landlord,
who had slipped in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your whisht,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) wife sharply; <div class="bookquote">``it is not your business to
check the girl; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is a good servant to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, is the cock never to crow, and the hens at it all day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can crow as loud as you like, my man out o' doors. But the hen
means to rule the roost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know a byword to that tune.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do ye, now? out wi't then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Femme veut en toute saison,
Estre dame en sa mason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard it afore; but `tis as sooth as gospel. Ay, they that
set these bywords a rolling had eyes and tongues, and tongues and eyes.
Before all the world give me an old saw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And me a young husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marion</b></font>)</div>said Marion. <div class="bookquote">``Now there was a chance for you
all, and nobody spoke. Oh! it is too late now, I've changed my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the better for some poor fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>suggested Denys.

<p/>And now the arrival of the young mistress, or, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was called, the
little mistress, was the signal for them all to draw round the fire,
like one happy family, travellers, host, hostess, and even servants in
the outer ring, and tell stories till bedtime. And Gerard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turn
told a tremendous one out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) repertory, a MS. collection of <div class="bookquote">``acts of
the saints,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>and made them all shudder deliciously; but soon after began
to nod, exhausted by the effort, I should say. The young mistress saw,
and gave Marion a look. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) instantly lighted a rush, and laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>)
hand on Gerard's shoulder, invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a
room where were two nice white beds, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) choose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Either is paradise,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'll take this one. Do you know, I have
not lain in a naked bed once since I left my home in Holland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack! poor soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``well, then, the sooner my flax and your
down -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!-RRB- come together, the better; so--allons!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) held out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) cheek as business-like as if it had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) hand for a fee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allons? what does that mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It means `good-night.' Ahem! What, don't they salute the chambermaid in
your part?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not all in a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, do they make a business on't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Nay, perverter of words, I mean we make not so free with strange women.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They must be strange women if they do not think you strange fools,
then. Here is a coil. Why, all the old greasy greybeards that lie at our
inn do kiss us chambermaids; faugh! and what have we poor wretches to
set on t'other side the compt but now and then a nice young--? Alack!
time flies, chambermaids can't be spared long in the nursery, so how
is't to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An't please you arrange with my comrade for both. He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) is mulierose; I am
not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, `tis the curb he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) will want, not the spur. Well! well! you shall
to bed without paying the usual toll; and oh, but `tis sweet to fall
in with a young man who can withstand these ancient ill customs, and
gainsay brazen hussies. Shalt have thy reward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you! But what are you doing with my bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me? oh, only taking off these sheets, and going to put on the pair the
drunken miller slept in last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! no! You cruel, black-hearted thing! There! there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A la bonne heure! What will not perseverance effect? But note now the
frowardness of a mad wench! I cared not for't a button. I am dead sick
of that sport this five years. But you denied me; so then forthwith I
behoved to have it; belike had gone through fire and water for't. Alas,
young sir, we women are kittle cattle; poor perverse toads: excuse us:
and keep us in our place, savoir, at arm's length; and so good-night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) turned and said, with a complete change of tone and
manner: <div class="bookquote">``The Virgin guard thy head, and the holy Evangelists watch the
bed where lies a poor young wanderer far from home! Amen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) run tearing down the stairs, and soon a
peal of laughter from the salle betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) whereabouts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that is a character,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard profoundly, and yawned over the
discovery.

<p/>In a very few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was in a dry bath of cold, clean linen,
inexpressibly refreshing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) after so long disuse: then came a
delicious glow; and then--Sevenbergen.


<p/>In the morning Gerard awoke infinitely refreshed, and was for rising,
but found himself a close prisoner. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) linen had vanished. Now this
was paralysis; for the nightgown is a recent institution. In Gerard's
century, and indeed long after, men did not play fast and loose with
clean sheets -LRB-when they could get them-RRB-, but crept into them clothed
with their innocence, like Adam: out of bed they seem to have taken most
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) eldest son.

<p/>Gerard bewailed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) captivity to Denys; but that instant the door
opened, and in sailed Marion with their linen, newly washed and ironed,
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) two arms, and set it down on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you good girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack, have you found me out at last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed. Is this another custom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, not to take them unbidden: but at night we aye question
travellers, are they for linen washed. So I came into you, but you were
both sound. Then said I to the little mistress, `La! where is the sense
of waking wearied men, t'ask them is Charles the Great dead, and would
they liever carry foul linen or clean, especially this one with a skin
like cream? `And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has, I declare,' said the young mistress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>remarked Denys, with the air of a commentator.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess once more, and you'll hit the mark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) not, Marion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is an impudent fellow; and I am sure we
cannot be grateful enough for your goodness, and I am sorry I ever
refused you--anything you fancied you should like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, are ye there,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said l’espiegle. <div class="bookquote">``I take that to mean you would
fain brush the morning dew off, as your bashful companion calls it; well
then, excuse me, `tis customary, but not prudent. I decline. Quits with
you, lad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop! stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) was making off victorious, <div class="bookquote">``I am
curious to know how many, of ye were here last night a-feasting your
eyes on us twain.

<p/>```Twas so satisfactory a feast as we weren't half a minute over't. Who?
why the big mistress, the little mistress, Janet, and me, and the whole
posse comitatus, on tiptoe. We mostly make our rounds the last thing,
not to get burned down; and in prodigious numbers. Somehow that maketh
us bolder, especially where archers lie scattered about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did not you tell me? I'd have lain awake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Beau sire, the saying goes that the good and the ill are all one while
their lids are closed. So we said, `Here is one who will serve God best
asleep, Break not his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rest!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) is funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard dictatorially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be either that or knavish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because `The Three Fish' pay me to be funny. You will eat before you
part? Good! then I'll go see the meat be fit for such worshipful teeth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Denys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish that was a great boy, and going along with us, to keep us
cheery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do not I. But I wish it was going along with us as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now Heaven forefend! A fine fool you would make of yourself.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They broke their fast, settled their score, and said farewell. Then
it was they found that Marion had not exaggerated the <div class="bookquote">``custom of the
country.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marion</b></font>)</div>The three principal women took and kissed them right heartily,
and they kissed the three principal women. The landlord took and kissed
them, and they kissed the landlord; and the cry was, <div class="bookquote">``Come back, the
sooner the better!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never pass `The Three Fish'; should your purses be void, bring
yourselves: `le sieur credit' is not dead for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And they took the road again.

<p/>They came to a little town, and Denys went to buy shoes. The shopkeeper
was in the doorway, but wide awake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) received Denys with a bow down
to the ground. The customer was soon fitted, and followed to the street,
and dismissed with graceful salutes from the doorstep.

<p/>The friends agreed it was Elysium to deal with such a shoemaker as this.
<div class="bookquote">``Not but what my German shoes have lasted well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard the
just.

<p/>Outside the town was a pebbled walk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is to keep the burghers's feet dry, a-walking o' Sundays with
their wives and daughters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys.

<p/>Those simple words of Denys, one stroke of a careless tongue, painted
<div class="bookquote">``home''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>in Gerard's heart. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, how sweet!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy! what is this? A gibbet! and ugh, two skeletons thereon!
Oh, Denys, what a sorry sight to woo by!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, <div class="bookquote">``a comfortable sight; for every rogue i' the air
there is one the less a-foot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>A little farther on they came to two pillars, and between these was a
huge wheel closely studded with iron prongs; and entangled in these were
bones and fragments of cloth miserably dispersed over the wheel.

<p/>Gerard hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, to think those patches and bones
are all that is left of a man! of one who was what we are now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excusez! a thing that went on two legs and stole; are we no more than
that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How know ye he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stole? Have true men never suffered death and torture
too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None of my kith ever found their way to the gibbet, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The better their luck. Prithee, how died the saints?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hard. But not in Burgundy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye massacred them wholesale at Lyons, and that is on Burgundy's
threshold. To you the gibbet proves the crime, because you read not
story. Alas! had you stood on Calvary that bloody day we sigh for to
this hour, I tremble to think you had perhaps shouted for joy at the
gibbet builded there; for the cross was but the Roman gallows, Father
Martin says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The blaspheming old hound!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, fie! fie! a holy and a book-learned man. Ay, Denys, y’had read
them, that suffered there, by the bare light of the gibbet. `Drive
in the nails!' y’had cried: `drive in the spear!' Here be three
malefactors. Three `roues.' Yet of those little three one was the first
Christian saint, and another was the Saviour of the world which gibbeted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) honour they managed things better in Burgundy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) added, too, after profound reflection, that the horrors Gerard had
alluded to had more than once made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) curse and swear with rage when
told by the good cure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) native village at Eastertide: <div class="bookquote">``but they
chanced in an outlandish nation, and near a thousand years agone. Mort
de ma vie, let us hope it is not true; or at least sore exaggerated. Do
but see how all tales gather as they roll!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reflected again, and all in a moment turned red with ire. <div class="bookquote">``Do
ye not blush to play with your book-craft on your unlettered friend, and
throw dust in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes, evening the saints with these reptiles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) good humour. <div class="bookquote">``Since your heart beats for
vermin, feel for the carrion crows! they be as good vermin as these;
would ye send them to bed supperless, poor pretty poppets? Why, these
be their larder; the pangs of hunger would gnaw them dead, but for cold
cut-purse hung up here and there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard, who had for some time maintained a dead silence, informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
the subject was closed between them, and for ever. <div class="bookquote">``There are things,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``in which our hearts seem wide as the poles asunder, and eke
our heads. But I love thee dearly all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added, with infinite
grace and tenderness.

<p/>Towards afternoon they heard a faint wailing noise on ahead; it grew
distincter as they proceeded. Being fast walkers they soon came up with
its cause: a score of pikemen, accompanied by several constables, were
marching along, and in advance of them was a herd of animals they were
driving. These creatures, in number rather more than a hundred, were of
various ages, only very few were downright old: the males were downcast
and silent. It was the females from whom all the outcry came. In other
words, the animals thus driven along at the law's point were men and
women.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``what a band of them! But stay, surely all
those children cannot be thieves; why, there are some in arms. What on
earth is this, Denys?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) to ask that <div class="bookquote">``bourgeois''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>with the badge; <div class="bookquote">``This is
Burgundy: here a civil question ever draws a civil reply.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard went up to the officer, and removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cap, a civility which
was immediately returned, said, <div class="bookquote">``For our Lady's sake, sir, what do ye
with these poor folk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, what is that to you, my lad?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the functionary
suspiciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master, I'm a stranger, and athirst for knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is another matter. What are we doing? ahem. Why we--Dost hear,
Jacques? Here is a stranger seeks to know what we are doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>and the
two machines were tickled that there should be a man who did not know
something they happened to know. In all ages this has tickled. However,
the chuckle was brief and moderated by the native courtesy, and the
official turned to Gerard again. <div class="bookquote">``What we are doing? hum!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
hesitated, not from any doubt as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was doing, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
was hunting for a single word that should convey the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ce que nous faisons, mon gars?--Mais--dam--NOUS TRANSVASONS.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You decant? that should mean you pour from one vessel to another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) explained that last year the town of Charmes had been
sore thinned by a pestilence, whole houses emptied and trades short of
hands. Much ado to get in the rye, and the flax half spoiled. So the
bailiff and aldermen had written to the duke's secretary; and the duke
he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) sent far and wide to know what town was too full. <div class="bookquote">``That are we,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had
the baillie of Toul writ back. <div class="bookquote">``Then send four or five score of your
townsfolk,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the order. <div class="bookquote">``Was not this to decant the full town into

not let the duchy be weakened, nor its fair towns laid waste by sword
nor pestilence; but meets the one with pike, and arbalest -LRB-touching his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
cap to the sergeant and Denys alternately-RRB-, and t'other with policy?
LONG LIVE THE DUKE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The pikemen of course were not to be outdone in loyalty; so they shouted
with stentorian lungs <div class="bookquote">``LONG LIVE THE DUKE!''  (<font color='red'><b>the ones sentiment</b></font>)</div>Then the decanted ones,
partly because loyalty was a non-reasoning sentiment in those days,
partly perhaps because they feared some further ill consequence should
they alone be mute, raised a feeble, tremulous shout, <div class="bookquote">``Long live the
Duke!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ones sentiment</b></font>)</div><p/>But, at this, insulted nature rebelled. Perhaps indeed the sham
sentiment drew out the real, for, on the very heels of that royal noise,
a loud and piercing wail burst from every woman's bosom, and a deep,
deep groan from every man's; oh! the air filled in a moment with womanly
and manly anguish. Judge what it must have been when the rude pikemen
halted unbidden, all confused; as if a wall of sorrow had started up
before them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``En avant,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>roared the sergeant, and they marched again, but muttering
and cursing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah the ugly sound,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the civilian, wincing. <div class="bookquote">``Les malheureux!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried
he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) ruefully: for where is the single man can hear the sudden agony of
a multitude and not be moved? <div class="bookquote">``Les ingrats! They are going whence
they were de trop to where they will be welcome: from starvation to
plenty--and they object. They even make dismal noises. One would think
we were thrusting them forth from Burgundy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>whispered Gerard, trembling; <div class="bookquote">``come away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>and the friends
strode forward.

<p/>When they passed the head of the column, and saw the men walk with their
eyes bent in bitter gloom upon the ground, and the women, some carrying,
some leading little children, and weeping as they went, and the poor
bairns, some frolicking, some weeping because <div class="bookquote">``their mammies''  (<font color='red'><b>some children</b></font>)</div>wept,
Gerard tried hard to say a word of comfort, but choked and could utter
nothing to the mourners; but gasped, <div class="bookquote">``Come on, Denys, I cannot mock such
sorrow with little words of comfort.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mourners</b></font>)</div>And now, artist-like, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) aim
was to get swiftly out of the grief he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could not soothe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) almost ran
not to hear these sighs and sobs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, mate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, <div class="bookquote">``art the colour of a lemon. Man alive, take not
other folk's troubles to heart! not one of those whining milksops there
but would see thee, a stranger, hanged without winking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard scarce listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Decant them?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) groaned; <div class="bookquote">``ay, if blood were no thicker than wine.
Princes, ye are wolves. Poor things! Poor things! Ah, Denys! Denys!
with looking on their grief mine own comes home to me. Well-a-day! ah,
well-a-day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, now you talk reason. That you, poor lad, should be driven all the
way from Holland to Rome is pitiful indeed. But these snivelling curs,
where is their hurt? There is six score of `em to keep one another
company: besides, they are not going out of Burgundy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better for them if they had never been in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mechant, va! they are but going from one village to another, a mule's
journey! whilst thou--there, no more. Courage, camarade, le diable est
mort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head very doubtfully, but kept silence for about a
mile, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``Ay, Denys, but then I am sustained
by booklearning. These are simple folk that likely thought their village
was the world: now what is this? more weeping. Oh! `tis a sweet world
Humph! A little girl that hath broke her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pipkin. Now may I hang on one
of your gibbets but I'll dry somebody's tears,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pounced savagely
upon this little martyr, like a kite on a chick, but with more generous
intentions. It was a pretty little lass of about twelve; the tears were
raining down her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) two peaches, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) palms lifted to heaven in that
utter, though temporary, desolation which attends calamity at twelve;
and at her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) feet the fatal cause, a broken pot, worth, say the fifth of a
modern farthing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, hast broken thy pot, little one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, acting intensest
sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helas! bel gars; as you behold;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the hands came down from the sky
and both pointed at the fragments. A statuette of adversity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you weep so for that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Needs I must, bel gars. My mammy will massacre me. Do they not already''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a fresh burst of woe-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``c-c-call me J-J-Jean-net-on C-c-casse tout?
It wanted but this; that I should break my poor pot. Helas! fallait-il
donc, mere de Dieu?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, little love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard; ```tis not thy heart lies broken;
money will soon mend pots. See now, here is a piece of silver, and
there, scarce a stone's throw off, is a potter; take the bit of silver
to him (<font color='blue'><b>potter</b></font>), and buy another pot, and the copper the potter will give thee
keep that to play with thy comrades.''

<p/>The little mind took in all this, and smiles began to struggle with the
tears: but spasms are like waves, they cannot go down the very moment
the wind of trouble is lulled. So Denys thought well to bring up his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
reserve of consolation <div class="bookquote">``Courage, ma mie, le diable est mort!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried that
inventive warrior gaily. Gerard shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shoulders at such a way of
cheering a little girl,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fine thing
Is a lute with one string,''

 (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div><p/>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>The little girl's face broke into warm sunshine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the good news! oh, the good news!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sang out with such heartfelt
joy, it went off into a honeyed whine; even as our gay old tunes have
a pathos underneath <div class="bookquote">``So then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``they will no longer be able to
threaten us little girls with him (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>), making our lives a burden!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
bounded off <div class="bookquote">``to tell Nanette,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.

<p/>There is a theory that everything has its counterpart; if true, Denys it
would seem had found the mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) consigne fitted.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was roaring with laughter at its unexpected success and
Gerard's amazement, a little hand pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) jerkin and a little face
peeped round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) waist. Curiosity was now the dominant passion in that
small but vivid countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Est-ce toi qui l’a tue, beau soldat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oui, ma mie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, as gruffly as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) could, rightly deeming
this would smack of supernatural puissance to owners of bell-like
trebles. <div class="bookquote">``C’est moi. Ca vaut une petite embrassade--pas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Je crois ben. Aie! aie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Qu’as-tu?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ca pique! ca pique!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quel dommage! je vais la couper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Nein, ce n’est rien; et pisque t'as tue ce mechant. T’es fierement
beau, tout d’ meme, toi; t'es lien miex que ma grande soeur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you not kiss me, too, ma mie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Je ne demande par miex. Tiens, tiens, tiens! c’est doulce celle-ci. Ah!
que j’aimons les hommes! Des fames, ca ne m'aurait jamais donne l’arjan,
blanc, plutot ca m'aurait ri au nez. C’est si peu de chose, les fames.
Serviteur, beaulx sires! Bon voiage; et n’oubliez point la Jeanneton!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Adieu, petit coeur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, and on they marched; but presently
looking back they saw the contemner of women in the middle of the road,
making them a reverence, and blowing them kisses with little May morning
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard lustily. <div class="bookquote">``I shall win to Rome yet. Holy St.
Bavon, what a sunbeam of innocence hath shot across our bloodthirsty
road! Forget thee, little Jeanneton? not likely, amidst all this
slobbering, and gibbeting, and decanting. Come on, thou laggard!
forward!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dost call this marching?''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Denys; <div class="bookquote">``why, we shall walk o’er
Christmas Day and never see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>At the next town they came to, suddenly an arbalestrier ran out of a
tavern after them, and in a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) beard and Denys's were like two
brushes stuck together. It was a comrade. He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) insisted on their coming
into the tavern with him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>), and breaking a bottle of wine. In course of
conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) told Denys there was an insurrection in the Duke's
Flemish provinces, and soldiers were ordered thither from all parts of
Burgundy. ``Indeed, I marvelled to see thy face turned this way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I go to embrace my folk that I have not seen these three years. Ye can
quell a bit of a rising without me I trow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly Denys gave a start. <div class="bookquote">``Dost hear Gerard? this comrade is bound
for Holland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then? ah, a letter! a letter to Margaret! but will he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) be so good,
so kind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The soldier</b></font>)</div><p/>The soldier with a torrent of blasphemy informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) would not only
take it, but go a league or two out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) way to do it.

<p/>In an instant out came inkhorn and paper from Gerard's wallet; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
wrote a long letter to Margaret, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) briefly what I fear I have
spun too tediously; dwelt most on the bear, and the plunge in the Rhine,
and the character of Denys, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) painted to the life. And with many
endearing expressions bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to be of good cheer; some trouble and
peril there had been, but all that was over now, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) only grief left
was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) could not hope to have a word from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand till he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) should
reach Rome. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) ended with comforting her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) again as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) could. And
so absorbed was he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) love and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) work, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) did not see all the
people in the room were standing peeping, to watch the nimble and true
finger execute such rare penmanship.

<p/>Denys, proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) friend's skill, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) alone, till presently the
writer's face worked, and soon the scalding tears began to run down his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
young cheeks, one after another, on the paper where he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was then writing
comfort, comfort. Then Denys rudely repulsed the curious, and asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
comrade with a faltering voice whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had the heart to let so sweet
a love-letter miscarry? The other swore by the face of St. Luke he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) would
lose the forefinger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) right hand sooner.

<p/>Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) so ready, Gerard charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) also with a short, cold letter
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) parents; and in it he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) drew hastily with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pen two hands
grasping each other, to signify farewell. By-the-by, one drop of
bitterness found its way into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) letter to Margaret. But of that anon.

<p/>Gerard now offered money to the soldier. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hesitated, but declined it.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no! art comrade of my comrade; and may''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-etc.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``but thy love for
the wench touches me. I'll break another bottle at thy charge an thou
wilt, and so cry quits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well said, comrade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys. <div class="bookquote">``Hadst taken money, I had invited
thee to walk in the courtyard and cross swords with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whereupon I had cut thy comb for thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>retorted the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadst done thy endeavour, drole, I doubt not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They drank the new bottle, shook hands, adhered to custom, and parted on
opposite routes.

<p/>This delay, however, somewhat put out Denys's calculations, and evening
surprised them ere they reached a little town he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was making for, where
was a famous hotel. However, they fell in with a roadside auberge, and
Denys, seeing a buxom girl at the door, said, <div class="bookquote">``This seems a decent
inn,''  (<font color='red'><b>a buxom girl</b></font>)</div>and led the way into the kitchen. They ordered supper, to which
no objection was raised, only the landlord requested them to pay for it
beforehand. It was not an uncommon proposal in any part of the world.
Still it was not universal, and Denys was nettled, and dashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hand
somewhat ostentatiously into his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) purse and pulled out a gold angel.
<div class="bookquote">``Count me the change, and speedily,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You tavern-keepers are
more likely to rob me than I you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>While the supper was preparing, Denys disappeared, and was eventually
found by Gerard in the yard, helping Manon, his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) plump but not bright
decoy duck, to draw water, and pouring extravagant compliments into her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>)
dullish ear. Gerard grunted and returned to table, but Denys did not
come in for a good quarter of an hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uphill work at the end of a march,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What matters that to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard drily. <div class="bookquote">``The mad dog bites all
the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exaggerator. You know I bite but the fairer half. Well, here comes
supper; that is better worth biting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>During supper the girl kept constantly coming in and out, and looking
point-blank at them, especially at Denys; and at last in leaning over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) to remove a dish, dropped a word in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) ear; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) replied with a
nod.

<p/>As soon as supper was cleared away, Denys rose and strolled to the door,
telling Gerard the sullen fair had relented, and given him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) a little
rendezvous in the stable-yard.

<p/>Gerard suggested that the calf-pen would have been a more appropriate
locality. <div class="bookquote">``I shall go to bed, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), a little crossly. <div class="bookquote">``Where
is the landlord? out at this time of night? no matter. I know our room.
Shall you be long, pray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I. I grudge leaving the fire and thee. But what can I do? There are
two sorts of invitations a Burgundian never declines.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys found a figure seated by the well. It was Manon; but instead
of receiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had a right to expect, coming by
invitation, all she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) did was to sob. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) what ailed her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>)
sobbed. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) do anything for her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) sobbed.

<p/>The good-natured Denys, driven to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) wits' end, which was no great
distance, proffered the custom of the country by way of consolation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>)
repulsed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) roughly. <div class="bookquote">``Is it a time for fooling?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>), and sobbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, waxing wroth. But the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
added tenderly, <div class="bookquote">``and I, who could never bear to see beauty in distress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who then? your sweetheart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, que nenni. My sweetheart is not on earth now: and to think I have
not an ecu to buy masses for his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) soul;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and in this shallow nature the
grief seemed now to be all turned in another direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, <div class="bookquote">``shalt have money to buy masses for thy dead
lad; I swear it. Meantime tell me why you weep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For me? Art mad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I am not mad. `Tis you that were mad to open your purse before
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>The mystery seemed to thicken, and Denys, wearied of stirring up the
mud by questions, held his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) peace to see if it would not clear of itself.
Then the girl, finding herself no longer questioned, seemed to go
through some internal combat. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, doggedly and aloud, <div class="bookquote">``I
will. The Virgin give me courage? What matters it if they kill me, since
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is dead? Soldier, the landlord is out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, is he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, do landlords leave their taverns at this time of night? also
see what a tempest! We are sheltered here, but t'other side it blows a
hurricane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is gone to fetch the band.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The band! what band?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those who will cut your throat and take your gold. Wretched man; to go
and shake gold in an innkeeper's face!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>The blow came so unexpectedly it staggered even Denys, accustomed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
was to sudden perils. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) muttered a single word, but in it a volume.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard! What is that? Oh, `tis thy comrade's name, poor lad. Get him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
out quick ere they come; and fly to the next town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And thou?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will kill me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That shall they not. Fly with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>```Twill avail me nought: one of the band will be sent to kill me. They
are sworn to slay all who betray them.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take thee to my native place full thirty leagues from hence, and
put thee under my own mother's wing, ere they shall hurt a hair o' thy
head. But first Gerard. Stay thou here whilst I fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was darting off, the girl seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) convulsively, and with all
the iron strength excitement lends to women. <div class="bookquote">``Stay me not! for pity's
sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) cried; ```tis life or death.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sh!--sh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>whispered the girl, shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mouth hard with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand,
and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pale lips close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes, that seemed to
turn backwards, straining towards some indistinct sound.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) listened.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) heard footsteps, many footsteps, and no voices. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
ear, <div class="bookquote">``They are come.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And trembled like a leaf.

<p/>Denys felt it was so. Travellers in that number would never have come in
dead silence.

<p/>The feet were now at the very door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How many?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), in a hollow whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) very ear. And who, that had seen
this man and woman in that attitude, would have guessed what freezing
hearts were theirs, and what terrible whispers passed between them?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How armed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sword and dagger: and the giant with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) axe. They call him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) the Abbot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my comrade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing can save him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Better lose one life than two. Fly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys's blood froze at this cynical advice. <div class="bookquote">``Poor creature, you know not
a soldier's heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hands a moment, and a hundred thoughts of dangers
baffled whirled through his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) brain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, girl! There is one chance for our lives, if thou wilt but be
true to us. Run to the town; to the nearest tavern, and tell the first
soldier there, that a soldier here is sore beset, but armed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
life to be saved if they will but run. Then to the bailiff. But first
to the soldiers. Nay, not a word, but buss me, good lass, and fly! men's
lives hang on thy heels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kilted up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gown to run. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) came round to the road with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cross the road cringing with fear, then glide away, then turn into
an erect shadow, then melt away in the storm.

<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) must get to Gerard. But how? He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had to run the gauntlet of
the whole band. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) asked himself, what was the worst thing they could
do? for he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had learned in war that an enemy does, not what you hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
will do, but what you hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) will not do. <div class="bookquote">``Attack me as I enter the
kitchen! Then I must not give them time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) drew near to the latch, a terrible thought crossed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Suppose they had already dealt with Gerard. Why, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``nought is left but to kill, and be killed;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) strung his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) bow, and
walked rapidly into the kitchen. There were seven hideous faces seated
round the fire, and the landlord pouring them out neat brandy, blood's
forerunner in every age.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? company!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys gaily; <div class="bookquote">``one minute, my lads, and I'll be
with you;''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) snatched up a lighted candle off the table, opened the
door that led to the staircase, and went up it hallooing. <div class="bookquote">``What, Gerard!
whither hast thou skulked to?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hallooed louder,
<div class="bookquote">``Gerard, where art thou?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>After a moment, in which Denys lived an hour of agony, a peevish,
half-inarticulate noise issued from the room at the head of the little
stairs. Denys burst in, and there was Gerard asleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said, in a choking voice, then began to sing loud,
untuneful ditties. Gerard put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fingers into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ears; but presently
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw in Denys's face a horror that contrasted strangely with this
sudden merriment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What ails thee?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), sitting up and staring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hand spoke even more plainly than his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) lips.
<div class="bookquote">``Listen to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys then pointing significantly to the door, to show Gerard sharp ears
were listening hard by, continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) song aloud but under cover of it
threw in short muttered syllables.

<p/>``-LRB-Our lives are in peril.-RRB-

<p/>``-LRB-Thieves.-RRB-

<p/>``-LRB-Thy doublet.-RRB-

<p/>``-LRB-Thy sword.-RRB-

<p/>``Aid.

<p/>``Coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put off time.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then aloud--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now, wilt have t'other bottle?--Say nay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I tell thee, there are half-a-dozen jolly fellows. Tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but I am too wearied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Go thou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went to the door and called out cheerfully
<div class="bookquote">``Landlord, the young milksop will not rise. Give those honest fellows
t'other bottle. I will pay for't in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard a brutal and fierce chuckle.

<p/>Having thus by observation made sure the kitchen door was shut, and the
miscreants were not actually listening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) examined the chamber door
closely: then quietly shut it, but did not bolt it; and went and
inspected the window.

<p/>It was too small to get out of, and yet a thick bar of iron had been
let in the stone to make it smaller; and just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) made this chilling
discovery, the outer door of the house was bolted with a loud clang.

<p/>Denys groaned. <div class="bookquote">``The beasts are in the shambles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the thieves</b></font>)</div><p/>But would the thieves attack them while they were awake? Probably not.

<p/>Not to throw away this their best chance, the poor souls now made a
series of desperate efforts to converse, as if discussing ordinary
matters; and by this means Gerard learned all that had passed, and that
the girl was gone for aid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray Heaven she (<font color='blue'><b>milksop</b></font>) may not lose heart by the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys,
sorrowfully.

<p/>And Denys begged Gerard's forgiveness for bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) way
for this.

<p/>Gerard forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would fear them less, Gerard, but for one they call the Abbot.
I picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) out at once. Taller than you, bigger than us both put
together. Fights with an axe. Gerard, a man to lead a herd of deer to
battle. I shall kill that man to-night, or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will kill me. I think
somehow `tis he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will kill me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saints forbid! Shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the door! What avails his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strength against
your weapon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall pick him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out; but if it comes to hand fighting, run swiftly
under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guard, or you are a dead man. I tell thee neither of us may
stand a blow of that axe: thou never sawest such a body of a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard was for bolting the door; but Denys with a sign showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) that
half the door-post turned outward on a hinge, and the great bolt was
little more than a blind. <div class="bookquote">``I have forborne to bolt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that
they may think us the less suspicious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Near an hour rolled away thus. It seemed an age. Yet it was but a little
hour, and the town was a league distant. And some of the voices in the
kitchen became angry and impatient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They will not wait much longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, <div class="bookquote">``and we have no chance at
all unless we surprise them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do whate’er you bid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard meekly.

<p/>There was a cupboard on the same side as the door; but between it and
the window. It reached nearly to the ground, but not quite. Denys opened
the cupboard door and placed Gerard on a chair behind it. <div class="bookquote">``If they
run for the bed, strike at the napes of their necks! a sword cut there
always kills or disables.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then arranged the bolsters and their shoes
in the bed so as to deceive a person peeping from a distance, and drew
the short curtains at the head.

<p/>Meantime Gerard was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees. Denys looked round and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, <div class="bookquote">``above all, pray them to forgive me for bringing you
into this guet-apens!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>And now they grasped hands and looked in one another's eyes oh, such a
look! Denys's hand was cold, and Gerard's warm.

<p/>They took their posts.

<p/>Denys blew out the candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must keep silence now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>souls</b></font>)</div><p/>But in the terrible tension of their nerves and very souls they found
they could hear a whisper fainter than any man could catch at all
outside that door. They could hear each other's hearts thump at times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good news!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>breathed Denys, listening at the door. <div class="bookquote">``They are casting
lots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray that it may be the Abbot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes. Why?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) comes alone I can make sure of him (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Denys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear I shall go mad, if they do not come soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I feign sleep? Shall I snore?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Will that-------?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do then and God have mercy on us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys snored at intervals.

<p/>There was a scuffling of feet heard in the kitchen, and then all was
still.

<p/>Denys snored again. Then took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) position behind the door.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), or they, who had drawn the lot, seemed determined to run no
foolish risks. Nothing was attempted in a hurry.

<p/>When they were almost starved with cold, and waiting for the attack, the
door on the stairs opened softly and closed again. Nothing more.

<p/>There was another harrowing silence.

<p/>Then a single light footstep on the stair; and nothing more.

<p/>Then a light crept under the door and nothing more.

<p/>Presently there was a gentle scratching, not half so loud as a mouse's,
and the false door-post opened by degrees, and left a perpendicular
space, through which the light streamed in. The door, had it been
bolted, would now have hung by the bare tip of the bolt, which went into
the real door-post, but as it was, it swung gently open of itself. It
opened inwards, so Denys did not raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) crossbow from the ground, but
merely grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) dagger.

<p/>The candle was held up, and shaded from behind by a man's hand.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was inspecting the beds from the threshold, satisfied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
victims were both in bed.

<p/>The man glided into the apartment. But at the first step something in
the position of the cupboard and chair made him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) uneasy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) ventured no
further, but put the candle on the floor and stooped to peer under
the chair; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) stooped, an iron hand grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) shoulder, and a
dagger was driven so fiercely through his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) neck that the point came
out at his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) gullet. There was a terrible hiccough, but no cry; and
half-a-dozen silent strokes followed in swift succession, each a
death-blow, and the assassin was laid noiselessly on the floor.

<p/>Denys closed the door, bolted it gently, drew the post to, and even
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was going whispered Gerard to bring a chair. It was done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Help me set him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Parbleu.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Frighten them! Gain time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Even while saying this, Denys had whipped a piece of string round the
dead man's neck, and tied him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) to the chair, and there the ghastly figure
sat fronting the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Denys, I can do better. Saints forgive me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Be quick then, we have not many moments.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>And Denys got his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) crossbow ready, and tearing off his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) straw mattress,
reared it before him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) and prepared to shoot the moment the door should
open, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had no hope any more would come singly, when they found the
first did not return.

<p/>While thus employed, Gerard was busy about the seated corpse, and to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) amazement Denys saw a luminous glow spreading rapidly over the white
face.

<p/>Gerard blew out the candle; and on this the corpse's face shone still
more like a glowworm's head.

<p/>Denys shook in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) shoes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) teeth chattered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, in Heaven's name, is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! `tis but phosphorus, but `twill serve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Away! they will surprise thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In fact, uneasy mutterings were heard below, and at last a deep voice
said, <div class="bookquote">``What makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) so long? is the drole rifling them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>comrade enemy</b></font>)</div><p/>It was their comrade they suspected then, not the enemy. Soon a step
came softly but rapidly up the stairs: the door was gently tried.

<p/>When this resisted, which was clearly not expected, the sham post was
very cautiously moved, and an eye no doubt peeped through the aperture:
for there was a howl of dismay, and the man was heard to stumble back
and burst into the kitchen, here a Babel of voices rose directly on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
return.

<p/>Gerard ran to the dead thief and began to work on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Back, madman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>whispered Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay. I know these ignorant brutes; they will not venture here
awhile. I can make him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) ten times more fearful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At least close that opening! Let them not see you at your devilish
work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard closed the sham post, and in half a minute his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) brush gave the
dead head a sight to strike any man with dismay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) art to a
strange use, and one unparalleled perhaps in the history of mankind.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) illuminated his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dead enemy's face to frighten his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) living foe: the
staring eyeballs he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) made globes of fire; the teeth he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) left white, for
so they were more terrible by the contrast; but the palate and tongue
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tipped with fire, and made one lurid cavern of the red depths the
chapfallen jaw revealed: and on the brow he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wrote in burning letters
<div class="bookquote">``La Mort.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was doing it, the stout Denys was quaking, and
fearing the vengeance of Heaven; for one mans courage is not another's;
and the band of miscreants below were quarrelling and disputing loudly,
and now without disguise.

<p/>The steps that led down to the kitchen were fifteen, but they were
nearly perpendicular: there was therefore in point of fact no distance
between the besiegers and besieged, and the latter now caught almost
every word. At last one was heard to cry out, <div class="bookquote">``I tell ye the devil has
got him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) and branded him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) with hellfire. I am more like to leave this
cursed house than go again into a room that is full of fiends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Art drunk? or mad? or a coward?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another.

<p/>``Call me a coward, I'll give thee my dagger's point, and send thee where
Pierre sits o' fire for ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, no quarrelling when work is afoot,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>roared a tremendous diapason,
<div class="bookquote">``or I'll brain ye both with my fist, and send ye where we shall all go
soon or late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Abbot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>whispered Denys gravely.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) felt the voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had just heard could belong to no man but the
colossus he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had seen in passing through the kitchen. It made the place
vibrate. The quarrelling continued some time, and then there was a dead
silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look out, Gerard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay. What will they do next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall soon know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I wait for you, or cut down the first that opens the door?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait for me, lest we strike the same and waste a blow. Alas! we cannot
afford that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Dead silence.

<p/>Sudden came into the room a thing that made them start and their hearts
quiver.

<p/>And what was it? A moonbeam.

<p/>Even so can this machine, the body, by the soul's action, be strung
up to start and quiver. The sudden ray shot keen and pure into that
shamble.

<p/>Its calm, cold, silvery soul traversed the apartment in a stream of no
great volume, for the window was narrow.

<p/>After the first tremor Gerard whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Courage, Denys! God's eye
is on us even here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face turned
towards the window.

<p/>Ay it was like a holy eye opening suddenly on human crime and human
passions. Many a scene of blood and crime that pure cold eye had rested
on; but on few more ghastly than this, where two men, with a lighted
corpse between them, waited panting, to kill and be killed. Nor did the
moonlight deaden that horrible corpse-light. If anything it added to
its ghastliness: for the body sat at the edge of the moonbeam, which cut
sharp across the shoulder and the ear, and seemed blue and ghastly and
unnatural by the side of that lurid glow in which the face and eyes and
teeth shone horribly. But Denys dared not look that way.

<p/>The moon drew a broad stripe of light across the door, and on that his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
eyes were glued. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Gerard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard looked and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sword.

<p/>Acutely as they had listened, they had heard of late no sound on
the stair. Yet therein the door-post, at the edge of the stream of
moonlight, were the tips of the fingers of a hand.

<p/>The nails glistened.

<p/>Presently they began to crawl and crawl down towards the bolt, but
with infinite slowness and caution. In so doing they crept into the
moonlight. The actual motion was imperceptible, but slowly, slowly,
the fingers came out whiter and whiter; but the hand between the main
knuckles and the wrist remained dark.

<p/>Denys slowly raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) crossbow.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) levelled it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) took a long steady aim.

<p/>Gerard palpitated. At last the crossbow twanged. The hand was instantly
nailed, with a stern jar, to the quivering door-post. There was a scream
of anguish. <div class="bookquote">``Cut,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>whispered Denys eagerly, and Gerard's uplifted sword
descended and severed the wrist with two swift blows. A body sank down
moaning outside.

<p/>The hand remained inside, immovable, with blood trickling from it down
the wall. The fierce bolt, slightly barbed, had gone through it and deep
into the real door-post.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, with terrible cynicism.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) strung his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) crossbow, and kneeled behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) cover again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The next will be the Abbot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The wounded man moved, and presently crawled down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) companions on
the stairs, and the kitchen door was shut.

<p/>There nothing was heard now but low muttering. The last incident had
revealed the mortal character of the weapons used by the besieged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to think the Abbot's stomach is not so great as his (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) body,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said
Denys.

<p/>The words were scarcely out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mouth when the following events
happened all in a couple of seconds. The kitchen door was opened
roughly, a heavy but active man darted up the stairs without any manner
of disguise, and a single ponderous blow sent the door not only off its
hinges, but right across the room on to Denys's fortification, which it
struck so rudely as nearly to lay him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) flat. And in the doorway stood a
colossus with a glittering axe.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) saw the dead man with the moon's blue light on half his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) face, and the
red light on the other half and inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) chapfallen jaws: he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) stared,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) arms fell, his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) knees knocked together, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) crouched with terror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``LA MORT!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) cried, in tones of terror, and turned and fled. In which
act Denys started up and shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) through both jaws. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sprang with one
bound into the kitchen, and there leaned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) axe, spitting blood and
teeth and curses.

<p/>Denys strung his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) bow and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) breast.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) drew it out dismayed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My last bolt is gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) groaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we have our swords, and you have slain the giant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys gravely, <div class="bookquote">``I have not. And the worst is I have
wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Fool! to shoot at a retreating lion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had never faced thy
handiwork again, but for my meddling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! to your guard! I hear them open the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Denys, depressed by the one error he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had committed in all this
fearful night, felt convinced his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) last hour had come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sword,
but like one doomed. But what is this? a red light flickers on the
ceiling. Gerard flew to the window and looked out. There were men with
torches, and breastplates gleaming red. <div class="bookquote">``We are saved! Armed men!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sword through the window shouting, <div class="bookquote">``Quick! quick! we are
sore pressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Back!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>yelled Denys; <div class="bookquote">``they come! strike none but him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>That very moment the Abbot and two men with naked weapons rushed into
the room. Even as they came, the outer door was hammered fiercely, and
the Abbot's comrades hearing it, and seeing the torchlight, turned and
fled. Not so the terrible Abbot: wild with rage and pain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) spurned his (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>)
dead comrade, chair and all, across the room, then, as the men faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>)
on each side with kindling eyeballs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) tremendous axe like a
feather right and left, and cleared a space, then lifted it to hew them
both in pieces.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) antagonists were inferior in strength, but not in swiftness and
daring, and above all they had settled how to attack him (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>). The moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) reared his (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) axe, they flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) like cats, and both together. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>)
struck a full blow with his (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) weapon he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) would most likely kill one, but
the other would certainly kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) saw this, and intelligent as
well as powerful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) thrust the handle fiercely in Denys's face, and,
turning, jobbed with the steel at Gerard. Denys went staggering back
covered with blood. Gerard had rushed in like lightning, and, just as
the axe turned to descend on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sword so fiercely through
the giant's body, that the very hilt sounded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ribs like the blow
of a pugilist, and Denys, staggering back to help his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) friend, saw a
steel point come out of the Abbot behind.

<p/>The stricken giant bellowed like a bull, dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) axe, and clutching
Gerard's throat tremendously, shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) like a child. Then Denys with
a fierce snarl drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sword into the giant's back. <div class="bookquote">``Stand firm now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) pushed the cold steel through and through the giant and out at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) breast.

<p/>Thus horribly spitted on both sides, the Abbot gave a violent shudder,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) heels hammered the ground convulsively. His (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) lips, fast turning
blue, opened wide and deep, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``LA MORT!-LA MORT!-LA MORT!!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the first time in a roar of despair, and then twice in a horror-stricken
whisper, never to be forgotten.

<p/>Just then the street door was forced.

<p/>Suddenly the Abbot's arms whirled like windmills, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) huge body
wrenched wildly and carried them to the doorway, twisting their wrists
and nearly throwing them off their legs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)'ll win clear yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys: <div class="bookquote">``out steel! and in again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>They tore out their smoking swords, but ere they could stab again,
the Abbot leaped full five feet high, and fell with a tremendous crash
against the door below, carrying it away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) like a sheet of paper,
and through the aperture the glare of torches burst on the awe-struck
faces above, half blinding them.

<p/>The thieves at the first alarm had made for the back door, but driven
thence by a strong guard ran back to the kitchen, just in time to see
the lock forced out of the socket, and half-a-dozen mailed archers burst
in upon them. On these in pure despair they drew their swords.

<p/>But ere a blow was struck on either side, the staircase door behind them
was battered into their midst with one ponderous blow, and with it the
Abbot's body came flying, hurled as they thought by no mortal hand, and
rolled on the floor spouting blood from back and bosom in two furious
jets, and quivered, but breathed no more.

<p/>The thieves smitten with dismay fell on their knees directly, and the
archers bound them, while, above, the rescued ones still stood like
statues rooted to the spot, their dripping swords extended in the red
torchlight, expecting their indomitable enemy to leap back on them as
wonderfully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) had gone.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where be the true men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here be we. God bless you all! God bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a rush to the stairs, and half-a-dozen hard but friendly hands
were held out and grasped them warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Y’have saved our lives, lads,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys, <div class="bookquote">``y’have saved our lives
this night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>A wild sight met the eyes of the rescued pair. The room flaring with
torches, the glittering breastplates of the archers, their bronzed
faces, the white cheeks of the bound thieves, and the bleeding giant,
whose dead body these hard men left lying there in its own gore.

<p/>Gerard went round the archers and took them each by the hand with
glistening eyes, and on this they all kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); and this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
kissed them in return. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said to one handsome archer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own
age, <div class="bookquote">``Prithee, good soldier, have an eye to me. A strange drowsiness
overcomes me. Let no one cut my throat while I sleep--for pity's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>archer</b></font>)</div><p/>The archer promised with a laugh; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought Gerard was jesting: and
the latter went off into a deep sleep almost immediately.

<p/>Denys was surprised at this: but did not interfere; for it suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
immediate purpose. A couple of archers were inspecting the Abbot's body,
turning it half over with their feet, and inquiring, <div class="bookquote">``Which of the two
had flung this enormous rogue down from an upper storey like that; they
would fain have the trick of his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Abbot</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys at first pished and pshawed, but dared not play the braggart, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``That young vagabond will break in and say `twas
the finger of Heaven, and no mortal arm, or some such stuff, and make me
look like a fool.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But now, seeing Gerard unconscious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) suddenly gave
this required information.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, you see, comrades, I had run my sword through this one up
to the hilt, and one or two more of `em came buzzing about me; so it
behoved me have my sword or die: so I just put my foot against his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
stomach, gave a tug with my hand and a spring with my foot, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
flying to kingdom come! He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) died in the air, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) carrion rolled
in amongst you without ceremony: made you jump, I warrant me. But
pikestaves and pillage! what avails prattling of, these trifles once
they are gone by? buvons, camarades, buvons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The archers</b></font>)</div><p/>The archers remarked that it was easy to say <div class="bookquote">``buvons''  (<font color='red'><b>The archers</b></font>)</div>where no liquor
was, but not so easy to do it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I'll soon find you liquor. My nose hath a natural alacrity at
scenting out the wine. You follow me: and I my nose: bring a torch!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And
they left the room, and finding a short flight of stone steps, descended
them and entered a large, low, damp cellar.

<p/>It smelt close and dank: and the walls were encrusted here and there
with what seemed cobwebs; but proved to be saltpetre that had oozed out
of the damp stones and crystallized.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! the fine mouldy smell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys; <div class="bookquote">``in such places still lurks the
good wine; advance thy torch. Diable! what is that in the corner? A pile
of rags? No: `tis a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>They gathered round with the torch, and lo! a figure crouched on a heap
in the corner, pale as ashes and shivering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it is the landlord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get up, thou craven heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>the archers</b></font>)</div>shouted one of the archers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, man, the thieves are bound, and we are dry that bound them. Up!
and show us thy wine; for no bottles see here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, be the rascals bound?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>stammered the pale landlord; <div class="bookquote">``good news.
W-w-wine? that will I, honest sirs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) rose with unsure joints and offered to lead the way to the wine
cellar. But Denys interposed. <div class="bookquote">``You are all in the dark, comrades. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
in league with the thieves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack, good soldier, me in league with the accursed robbers! Is that
reasonable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The girl said so anyway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The girl! What girl? Ah! Curse her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), traitress!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the archer</b></font>)</div>interposed the other archer; <div class="bookquote">``the girl is not here, but gone on
to the bailiff. So let the burghers settle whether this craven be guilty
or no: for we caught him (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) not in the act: and let him (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) draw us our wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys shrewdly. <div class="bookquote">``Why cursed he (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) the girl? If he (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) be a
true man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should bless her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as we do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``I have but my good name to live by, and
I cursed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to you, because you said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had belied me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! I trow thou art a thief, and where is the thief that cannot lie
with a smooth face? Therefore hold him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>), comrades: a prisoner can draw
wine an if his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hands be not bound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlord offered no objection; but on the contrary said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) would
with pleasure show them where his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) little stock of wine was, but hoped
they would pay for what they should drink, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) rent was due this two
months.

<p/>The archers smiled grimly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) simplicity, as they thought it; one of
them laid a hand quietly but firmly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) shoulder, the other led on
with the torch.

<p/>They had reached the threshold when Denys cried <div class="bookquote">``Halt!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here be bottles in this corner; advance thy light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The torch-bearer</b></font>)</div><p/>The torch-bearer went towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had just taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) scabbard
and was probing the heap the landlord had just been crouched upon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``the wine is in the next cellar. There
is nothing there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing is mighty hard, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, and drew out something with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hand from the heap.

<p/>It proved to be only a bone.

<p/>Denys threw it on the floor: it rattled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nought there but the bones of the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now `twas nothing. Now that we have found something `tis nothing
but bones. Here's another. Humph? look at this one, comrade; and you
come too and look at it, and bring you smooth knave along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The archer</b></font>)</div><p/>The archer with the torch, whose name was Philippe, held the bone to the
light and turned it round and round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if this was a field of battle, I should say `twas the shankbone
of a man; no more, no less. But `tisn't a battlefield, nor a churchyard;
`tis an inn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, mate; but yon knave's ashy face is as good a light to me as a
field of battle. I read the bone by it, Bring yon face nearer, I say.
When the chine is amissing, and the house dog can't look at you without
his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) tail creeping between his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) legs, who was the thief? Good brothers
mine, my mind it doth misgive me. The deeper I thrust the more there be.
Mayhap if these bones could tell their tale they would make true men's
flesh creep that heard it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! young man, what hideous fancies are these! The bones are bones
of beeves, and sheep, and kids, and not, as you think, of men and women.
Holy saints preserve us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold thy peace! thy words are air. Thou hast not got burghers by the
ear, that know not a veal knuckle from their grandsire's ribs; but
soldiers-men that have gone to look for their dear comrades, and found
their bones picked as clean by the crows as these I doubt have been by
thee and thy mates. Men and women, saidst thou? And prithee, when spake
I a word of women's bones? Wouldst make a child suspect thee. Field
of battle, comrade! Was not this house a field of battle half an hour
agone? Drag him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) close to me, let me read his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) face: now then, what is
this, thou knave?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) thrust a small object suddenly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! I know not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I would not swear neither: but it is too like the thumb bone of
a man's hand; mates, my flesh it creeps. Churchyard! how know I this is
not one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) now drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sword out of the scabbard and began to rake the heap
of earth and broken crockery and bones out on the floor.

<p/>The landlord assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) but wasted his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) time. <div class="bookquote">``We poor innkeepers are
sinners,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``we give short measure and baptize the wine: we are
fain to do these things; the laws are so unjust to us; but we are not
assassins. How could we afford to kill our customers? May Heaven's
lightning strike me dead if there be any bones there but such as have
been used for meat. `Tis the kitchen wench flings them here: I swear by
God's holy mother, by holy Paul, by holy Dominic, and Denys my patron
saint--ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys held out a bone under his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) eye in dead silence. It was a bone no
man, however ignorant, however lying, could confound with those of sheep
or oxen. The sight of it shut the lying lips, and palsied the heartless
heart.

<p/>The landlord's hair rose visibly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) head like spikes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) knees
gave way as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) limbs had been struck from under him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). But the archers
dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) fiercely up, and kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) erect under the torch, staring
fascinated at the dead skull which, white as the living cheek opposed,
but no whiter, glared back again at its murderer, whose pale lip now
opened and opened, but could utter no sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys solemnly, and trembling now with rage, <div class="bookquote">``look on the
sockets out of which thou hast picked the eyes, and let them blast thine
eyes, that crows shall pick out ere this week shall end. Now, hold thou
that while I search on. Hold it, I say, or here I rob the gallows--''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) threatened the quaking wretch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) naked sword, till with a groan
he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) took the skull and held it, almost fainting.

<p/>Oh! that every murderer, and contriver of murder, could see him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>), sick,
and staggering with terror, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) hair on end, holding the cold
skull, and feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) own head would soon be like it. And soon
the heap was scattered, and alas! not one nor two, but many skulls were
brought to light, the culprit moaning at each discovery.

<p/>Suddenly Denys uttered a strange cry of distress to come from so bold
and hard a man; and held up to the torch a mass of human hair. It was
long, glossy, and golden. A woman's beautiful hair. At the sight of it
the archers instinctively shook the craven wretch in their hands: and he (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>)
whined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a little sister with hair just so fair and shining as this,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>gulped Denys. <div class="bookquote">``Jesu! if it should be hers! There quick, take my sword
and dagger, and keep them from my hand, lest I strike him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dead and wrong
the gibbet. And thou, poor innocent victim, on whose head this most
lovely hair did grow, hear me swear this, on bended knee, never to
leave this man till I see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) broken to pieces on the wheel even for thy
sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) knee. <div class="bookquote">``Ay, had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as many lives as here be hairs, I'd
have them all, by God,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) put the hair into his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) bosom. Then in a
sudden fury seized the landlord fiercely by the neck, and forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) knees; and foot on head ground his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) face savagely among the bones
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) victims, where they lay thickest; and the assassin first yelled,
then whined and whimpered, just as a dog first yells, then whines, when
his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) nose is so forced into some leveret or other innocent he (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) has killed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now lend me thy bowstring, Philippe!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) passed it through the eyes of
a skull alternately, and hung the ghastly relic of mortality and crime
round the man's neck; then pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up and kicked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) industriously
into the kitchen, where one of the aldermen of the burgh had arrived
with constables, and was even now taking an archer's deposition.

<p/>The grave burgher was much startled at sight of the landlord driven
in bleeding from a dozen scratches inflicted by the bones of his (<font color='blue'><b>burgher</b></font>) own
victims, and carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>burgher</b></font>) horrible collar. But Denys came panting after,
and in a few fiery words soon made all clear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bind him (<font color='blue'><b>Philippe</b></font>) like the rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>the alderman</b></font>)</div>said the alderman sternly. <div class="bookquote">``I count him (<font color='blue'><b>Philippe</b></font>) the
blackest of them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the wretch</b></font>)</div><p/>While his (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) hands were being bound, the poor wretch begged piteously that
<div class="bookquote">``the skull might be taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>Philippe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the wretch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph!''  (<font color='red'><b>the alderman</b></font>)</div>said the alderman. <div class="bookquote">``Certes I had not ordered such a thing to be
put on mortal man. Yet being there, I will not lift voice nor finger to
doff it. Methinks it fits thee truly, thou bloody dog. `Tis thy ensign,
and hangs well above a heart so foul as thine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) then inquired of Denys if he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) thought they had secured the whole gang,
or but a part.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your worship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, <div class="bookquote">``there are but seven of them, and this
landlord. One we slew upstairs, one we trundled down dead, the rest are

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! go fetch the dead one from upstairs, and lay him (<font color='blue'><b>ensign</b></font>) beside him (<font color='blue'><b>ensign</b></font>) I
caused to be removed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here a voice like a guinea-fowl's broke peevishly in. <div class="bookquote">``Now, now, now,
where is the hand? that is what I want to see.''  (<font color='red'><b>The speaker</b></font>)</div>The speaker was a little
pettifogging clerk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will find it above, nailed to the door-post by a crossbow bolt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) whispered his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) master, <div class="bookquote">``What a goodly show
will the `pieces de conviction' make!''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>and with this he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) wrote them down,
enumerating them in separate squeaks as he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) penned them. Skulls--Bones--A
woman's hair--A thief's hands 1 axe--2 carcasses--1 crossbow bolt.
This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) itched to search the cellar himself: there might be other
invaluable morsels of evidence, an ear, or even an earring. The alderman
assenting, he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) caught up a torch and was hurrying thither, when an
accident stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>), and indeed carried him (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) a step or two in the
opposite direction.

<p/>The constables had gone up the stair in single file.

<p/>But the head constable no sooner saw the phosphorescent corpse seated
by the bedside, than he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) stood stupefied; and next he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) began to shake like
one in an ague, and, terror gaining on him (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) more and more, he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) uttered a
sort of howl and recoiled swiftly. Forgetting the steps in his (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) recoil,
he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) tumbled over backward on his (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) nearest companion; but he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>), shaken by the
shout of dismay, and catching a glimpse of something horrid, was already
staggering back, and in no condition to sustain the head constable, who,
like most head constables, was a ponderous man. The two carried away the
third, and the three the fourth, and they streamed into the kitchen, and
settled on the floor, overlapping each other like a sequence laid out on
a card-table. The clerk coming hastily with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) torch ran an involuntary
tilt against the fourth man, who, sharing the momentum of the mass,
knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instantly on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, the ace of that fair quint; and there
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay kicking and waving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) torch, apparently in triumph, but
really in convulsion, sense and wind being driven out together by the
concussion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to do now, in Heaven's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>the alderman</b></font>)</div>cried the alderman, starting up
with considerable alarm. But Denys explained, and offered to accompany
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) worship. <div class="bookquote">``So be it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the latter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) men picked themselves
ruefully up, and the alderman put himself at their head and examined the
premises above and below. As for the prisoners, their interrogatory was
postponed till they could be confronted with the servant.

<p/>Before dawn, the thieves, alive and dead, and all the relics and
evidences of crime and retribution, were swept away into the law's
net, and the inn was silent and almost deserted. There remained but one
constable, and Denys and Gerard, the latter still sleeping heavily.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXV

<p/>Gerard awoke, and found Denys watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) with some anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is you for sleeping! Why, `tis high noon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a blessed sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard; <div class="bookquote">``methinks Heaven sent it me. It
hath put as it were a veil between me and that awful night. To think
that you and I sit here alive and well. How terrible a dream I seem to
have had!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, lad, that is the wise way to look at these things when once they
are past, why, they are dreams, shadows. Break thy fast, and then thou
wilt think no more on't. Moreover, I promised to bring thee on to the
town by noon, and take thee to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) worship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard then sopped some rye bread in red wine and ate it to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
fast: then went with Denys over the scene of combat, and came back
shuddering, and finally took the road with his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) friend, and kept peering
through the hedges, and expecting sudden attacks unreasonably, till they
reached the little town. Denys took him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``The White Hart'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No fear of cut-throats here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). ``I know the landlord this many
a year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) is a burgess, and looks to be bailiff. `Tis here I was making
for yestreen. But we lost time, and night o’ertook us--and--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you saw a woman at the door, and would be wiser than a Jeanneton;
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told us they were nought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what saved our lives if not a woman? Ay, and risked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own to do
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true, Denys; and though women are nothing to me, I long to
thank this poor girl, and reward her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), ay, though I share every doit in
my purse with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Do not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Parbleu.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where shall we find her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mayhap the alderman will tell us. We must go to him (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The alderman</b></font>)</div><p/>The alderman received them with a most singular and inexplicable
expression of countenance. However, after a moment's reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) wore
a grim smile, and finally proceeded to put interrogatories to Gerard,
and took down the answers. This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) told them that they must
stay in the town till the thieves were tried, and be at hand to give
evidence, on peril of fine and imprisonment. They looked very blank at
this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), ```twill not be long, the culprits having been taken
red-handed.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``And you know, in any case you could not leave
the place this week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys stared at this remark, and Gerard smiled at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought the
simplicity of the old gentleman in dreaming that a provincial town of
Burgundy had attraction to detain him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) from Rome and Margaret.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) now went to that which was nearest both their hearts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your worship,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we cannot find our benefactress in the town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, but who is your benefactress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? why the good girl that came to you by night and saved our lives at
peril of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own. Oh sir, our hearts burn within us to thank and bless
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); where is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXVI

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In prison, sir; good lack, for what misdeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is a witness, and may be a necessary one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Messire Bailiff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>put in Denys, <div class="bookquote">``you lay not all your witnesses by
the heels I trow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>The alderman, pleased at being called bailiff, became communicative.
<div class="bookquote">``In a case of blood we detain all testimony that is like to give us leg
bail, and so defeat justice, and that is why we still keep the women
folk. For a man at odd times hides a week in one mind, but a woman, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) do her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) duty to the realm o' Friday, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shall undo it afore Sunday,
or try. Could you see yon wench now, you should find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a-blubbering
at having betrayed five males to the gallows. Had they been females,
we might have trusted to a subpoena. For they despise one another.
And there they show some sense. But now I think on't, there were other
reasons for laying this one by the heels. Hand me those depositions,
young sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) glasses. <div class="bookquote">``Ay! she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was implicated; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
one of the band.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>A loud disclaimer burst from Denys and Gerard at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No need to deave me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the alderman</b></font>)</div>said the alderman. ``Here `tis in black and white.
`Jean Hardy -LRB-that is one of the thieves-RRB-, being questioned, confessed
that--humph? Ay, here `tis. `And that the girl Manon was the decoy,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) sweetheart was Georges Vipont, one of the band; and hanged last
month: and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) had been deject ever since, and had openly blamed
the band for his (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) death, saying if they had not been rank cowards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) had
never been taken, and it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) did but betray them out of
very spite, and--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard indignantly; <div class="bookquote">``what signifies the opinion
of a cut-throat, burning to be revenged on her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) who has delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) to
justice? And an you go to that, what avails his (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) testimony? Is a thief
never a liar? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) not aye a liar? and here a motive to lie? Revenge,
why, `tis the strongest of all the passions. And oh, sir, what madness
to question a detected felon and listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>felon</b></font>) lying away an honest
life--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>felon</b></font>) were a true man swearing in open day, with his (<font color='blue'><b>felon</b></font>) true hand
on the Gospel laid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the alderman</b></font>)</div>said the alderman, <div class="bookquote">``restrain thy heat in presence of
authority! I find by your tone you are a stranger. Know then that in
this land we question all the world. We are not so weak as to hope to
get at the truth by shutting either our left ear or our right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the alderman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you would listen to Satan belying the saints!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ta! ta! The law meddles but with men and women, and these cannot

it in, we do winnow and sift it. And who told you I had swallowed the

on't as was borne out by better proof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better proof?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>and Gerard looked blank. <div class="bookquote">``Why, who but the thieves would
breathe a word against her (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry, herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Herself, sir? what, did you question her (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you we question all the world. Here is her (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) deposition; can you
read?--Read it yourself, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard looked at Denys and read him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) Manon's deposition.

<p/>``I am a native of Epinal. I left my native place two years ago because
I was unfortunate: I could not like the man they bade me. So my father
beat me. I ran away from my father. I went to service. I left service
because the mistress was jealous of me. The reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) gave for
turning me off was, because I was saucy. Last year I stood in the
marketplace to be hired with other girls. The landlord of `The Fair
Star' hired me. I was eleven months with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). A young man courted me. I
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I found out that travellers came and never went away again.
I told my lover. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) bade me hold my peace. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) threatened me. I found my
lover was one of a band of thieves. When travellers were to be robbed,
the landlord went out and told the band to come. Then I wept and prayed
for the travellers' souls. I never told. A month ago my lover died.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The soldier put me in mind of my lover. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was bearded like him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) I had
lost. I cannot tell whether I should have interfered, if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had had no
beard. I am sorry I told now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>The paper almost dropped from Gerard's hands. Now for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
saw that Manon's life was in mortal danger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knew the dogged law, and
the dogged men that executed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) threw himself suddenly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees
at the alderman's feet. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir! think of the difference between those
cruel men and this poor weak woman! Could you have the heart to send her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
to the same death with them; could you have the heart to condemn us to
look on and see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) slaughtered, who, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) risked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life for
ours, had not now been in jeopardy? Alas, sir! show me and my comrade
some pity, if you have none for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), poor soul. Denys and I be true men,
and you will rend our hearts if you kill that poor simple girl. What
can we do? What is left for us to do then but cut our throats at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
gallows' foot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The alderman</b></font>)</div><p/>The alderman was tough, but mortal; the prayers and agitation of Gerard
first astounded, then touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) showed it in a curious way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
became peevish and fretful. <div class="bookquote">``There, get up, do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I doubt
whether anybody would say as many words for me. What ho, Daniel!
go fetch the town clerk.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And on that functionary entering from an
adjoining room, <div class="bookquote">``Here is a foolish lad fretting about yon girl. Can
we stretch a point? say we admit her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to bear witness, and question her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
favourably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The town clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>The town clerk was one of your <div class="bookquote">``impossibility''  (<font color='red'><b>The town clerk</b></font>)</div>men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir, we cannot do that: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not concerned in this business.
Had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) been accessory, we might have offered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a pardon to bear
witness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard burst in, <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did better. Instead of being accessory, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
stayed the crime; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) proffered herself as witness by running hither
with the tale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tush, young man, `tis a matter of law.''  (<font color='red'><b>The alderman clerk</b></font>)</div>The alderman and the clerk then
had a long discussion, the one maintaining, the other denying, that she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>)
stood as fair in law as if she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had been accessory to the attempt on
our travellers' lives. And this was lucky for Manon: for the alderman,
irritated by the clerk reiterating that he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) could not do this, and could
not that, and could not do t'other, said <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do
anything he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) had Manon out, and upon the landlord of <div class="bookquote">``The
White Hart''  (<font color='red'><b>Manon</b></font>)</div>being her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) bondsman, and Denys depositing five gold pieces
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), and the girl promising, not without some coaxing from Denys,
to attend as a witness, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) liberated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but eased his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) conscience by
telling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) own terms his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) reason for this leniency.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The town had to buy a new rope for everybody hanged, and present it
to the bourreau, or compound with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) in money: and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>)
opinion worth this municipal expense, whereas decided characters like
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) late confederates, were.''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>And so Denys and Gerard carried her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) off,
Gerard dancing round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for joy, Denys keeping up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart by
assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of the demise of a troublesome personage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) weeping
inauspiciously. However, on the road to <div class="bookquote">``The White Hart''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>the public
found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out, and having heard the whole story from the archers, who
naturally told it warmly in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) favour, followed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hurrahing and
encouraging her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), till finding herself backed by numbers she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) plucked up
heart. The landlord too saw at a glance that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) presence in the inn
would draw custom, and received her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) politely, and assigned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) an upper
chamber: here she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) buried herself, and being alone rained tears again.

<p/>Poor little mind, it was like a ripple, up and down, down and up, up and
down. Bidding the landlord be very kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a prisoner
without letting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feel it, the friends went out: and lo! as they
stepped into the street they saw two processions coming towards them
from opposite sides. One was a large one, attended with noise and howls
and those indescribable cries by which rude natures reveal at odd times
that relationship to the beasts of the field and forest, which at other
times we succeed in hiding. The other, very thinly attended by a few
nuns and friars, came slow and silent.

<p/>The prisoners going to exposure in the market-place. The gathered bones
of the victims coming to the churchyard.

<p/>And the two met in the narrow street nearly at the inn door, and could
not pass each other for a long time, and the bier, that bore the relics
of mortality, got wedged against the cart that carried the men who had
made those bones what they were, and in a few hours must die for it
themselves. The mob had not the quick intelligence to be at once struck
with this stern meeting: but at last a woman cried, <div class="bookquote">``Look at your work,
ye dogs!''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>and the crowd took it like wildfire, and there was a horrible
yell, and the culprits groaned and tried to hide their heads upon their
bosoms, but could not, their hands being tied. And there they stood,
images of pale hollow-eyed despair, and oh how they looked on the bier,
and envied those whom they had sent before them on the dark road they
were going upon themselves! And the two men who were the cause of both
processions stood and looked gravely on, and even Manon, hearing the
disturbance, crept to the window, and, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) face, peeped trembling
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) fingers, as women will.

<p/>This strange meeting parted Denys and Gerard. The former yielded
to curiosity and revenge, the latter doffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bonnet, and piously
followed the poor remains of those whose fate had so nearly been his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
own. For some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was the one lay mourner: but when they had reached
the suburbs, a long way from the greater attraction that was filling the
market-place, more than one artisan threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tools, and more
than one shopman left his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shop, and touched with pity or a sense of our
common humanity, and perhaps decided somewhat by the example of Gerard,
followed the bones bareheaded, and saw them deposited with the prayers
of the Church in hallowed ground.

<p/>After the funeral rites Gerard stepped respectfully up to the cure, and
offered to buy a mass for their souls.

<p/>Gerard, son of Catherine, always looked at two sides of a penny: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
tried to purchase this mass a trifle under the usual terms, on account
of the pitiable circumstances. But the good cure gently but adroitly
parried his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ingenuity, and blandly screwed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) up to the market price.

<p/>In the course of the business they discovered a similarity of
sentiments. Piety and worldly prudence are not very rare companions:
still it is unusual to carry both so far as these two men did. Their
collision in the prayer market led to mutual esteem, as when knight
encountered knight worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) steel. Moreover the good cure loved a
bit of gossip, and finding his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) customer was one of those who had fought
the thieves at Domfront, would have him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) parlour and hear the
whole from his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own lips. And his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) heart warmed to Gerard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said
<div class="bookquote">``God was good to thee. I thank Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for't with all my soul. Thou art
a good lad.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added drily, <div class="bookquote">``Shouldst have told me this tale in the
churchyard. I doubt, I had given thee the mass for love. However,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) -LRB-the thermometer suddenly falling-RRB-, ```tis ill luck to go back upon a
bargain. But I'll broach a bottle of my old Medoc for thee: and few
be the guests I would do that for.'' The cure went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cupboard, and
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) groped for the choice bottle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) muttered to himself, <div class="bookquote">``At their
old tricks again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plait-il?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said nought. Ay, here `tis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Nay, your reverence. You surely spoke: you said, `At their old tricks
again!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Said I so in sooth?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reverence smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then proceeded to
broach the wine, and filled a cup for each. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) put a log of wood on
the fire, for stoves were none in Burgundy. <div class="bookquote">``And so I said `At their old
tricks!' did I? Come, sip the good wine, and, whilst it lasts, story for
story, I care not if I tell you a little tale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard's eyes sparkled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou lovest a story?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, but raise not thine expectations too high, neither. `Tis but a
foolish trifle compared with thine adventures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>THE CURE'S TALE.

<p/>``Once upon a time, then, in the kingdom of France, and in the duchy
of Burgundy, and not a day's journey from the town where now we sit
a-sipping of old Medoc, there lived a cure. I say he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) lived; but barely.
The parish was small, the parishioners greedy; and never gave their
cure a doit more than he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) could compel. The nearer they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) to a
disembodied spirit by meagre diet, the holier should be his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) prayers in
their behalf. I know not if this was their creed, but their practice
gave it colour.

<p/>``At last he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) pickled a rod for them.

<p/>``One day the richest farmer in the place had twins to baptize. The cure
was had to the christening dinner as usual; but ere he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would baptize
the children, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) demanded, not the christening fees only, but the burial
fees. `Saints defend us, parson, cried the mother; `talk not of burying!
I did never see children liker to live.' `Nor I,' said the cure, `the
praise be to God. Natheless, they are sure to die, being sons of Adam,
as well as of thee, dame. But die when they will, `twill cost them
nothing, the burial fees being paid and entered in this book.' `For all
that `twill cost them something,' quoth the miller, the greatest wag
in the place, and as big a knave as any; for which was the biggest God
knoweth, but no mortal man, not even the hangman. `Miller, I tell thee
nay,' quo' the cure. `Parson, I tell you ay,' quo' the miller. `'Twill
cost them their lives.' At which millstone conceit was a great laugh;
and in the general mirth the fees were paid and the Christians made.

<p/>``But when the next parishioner's child, and the next after, and all, had
to pay each his (<font color='blue'><b>parishioner</b></font>) burial fee, or lose his (<font color='blue'><b>parishioner</b></font>) place in heaven, discontent did
secretly rankle in the parish. Well, one fine day they met in
secret, and sent a churchwarden with a complaint to the bishop, and a
thunderbolt fell on the poor cure. Came to him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) at dinner-time a summons
to the episcopal palace, to bring the parish books and answer certain
charges. Then the cure guessed where the shoe pinched. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) food
on the board, for small his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) appetite now, and took the parish books and
went quaking.

<p/>``The bishop entertained him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) with a frown, and exposed the plaint.
`Monseigneur,' said the cure right humbly, `doth the parish allege many
things against me, or this one only?' `In sooth, but this one,' said the
bishop, and softened a little. `First, monseigneur, I acknowledge the
fact.' `'Tis well,' quoth the bishop; `that saves time and trouble. Now
to your excuse, if excuse there be.' `Monseigneur, I have been cure of
that parish seven years, and fifty children have I baptized, and buried
not five. At first I used to say, ``Heaven be praised, the air of this
village is main healthy;'' but on searching the register book I found
`twas always so, and on probing the matter, it came out that of those
born at Domfront, all, but here and there one, did go and get hanged at
Aix. But this was to defraud not their cure only, but the entire Church
of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dues, since <div class="bookquote">``pendards''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pay no funeral fees, being buried in air.
Thereupon, knowing by sad experience their greed, and how they grudge
the Church every sou, I laid a trap to keep them from hanging; for,
greed against greed, there be of them that will die in their beds like
true men ere the Church shall gain those funeral fees for nought.'
Then the bishop laughed till the tears ran down, and questioned the
churchwarden, and he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was fain to confess that too many of the parish did
come to that unlucky end at Aix. `Then,' said the bishop, `I do approve
the act, for myself and my successors; and so be it ever, till they
mend their manners and die in their beds.' And the next day came the
ringleaders crestfallen to the cure, and said, `Parson, ye were even
good to us, barring this untoward matter: prithee let there be no ill
blood anent so trivial a thing.' And the cure said, `My children, I were
unworthy to be your pastor could I not forgive a wrong; go in peace, and
get me as many children as may be, that by the double fees the cure you
love may miss starvation.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the bishop often told the story, and it kept his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) memory of the cure
alive, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) shifted him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) to a decent parish, where he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) can offer
a glass of old Medoc to such as are worthy of it. Their name it is not
legion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>A light broke in upon Gerard, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) countenance showed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) host, <div class="bookquote">``I am that cure: so now thou canst guess why I said
`At their old tricks.' My life on't they have wheedled my successor into
remitting those funeral fees. You are well out of that parish. And so am
I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>niece</b></font>)</div><p/>The cure's little niece burst in, <div class="bookquote">``Uncle, the weighing--la! a stranger!''
 (<font color='red'><b>niece</b></font>)</div>And burst out.

<p/>The cure rose directly, but would not part with Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wet thy beard once more, and come with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sexton weights</b></font>)</div><p/>In the church porch they found the sexton with a huge pair of scales,
and weights of all sizes. Several humble persons were standing by, and
soon a woman stepped forward with a sickly child and said, <div class="bookquote">``Be it heavy
be it light, I vow, in rye meal of the best, whate’er this child shall
weigh, and the same will duly pay to Holy Church, an if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) shall cast
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) trouble. Pray, good people, for this child, and for me his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mother
hither come in dole and care!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child was weighed, and yelled as if the scale had been the font.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage! dame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``This is a good sign. There is plenty of
life here to battle its trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, blest be the tongue that tells me so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the poor woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
hushed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ponderling against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom, and stood aloof watching,
whilst another woman brought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child to scale.

<p/>But presently a loud, dictatorial voice was heard, <div class="bookquote">``Way there, make way
for the seigneur!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The folk</b></font>)</div><p/>The small folk parted on both sides like waves ploughed by a lordly
galley, and in marched in gorgeous attire, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cap adorned by a feather
with a topaz at its root, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) jerkin richly furred, satin doublet, red
hose, shoes like skates, diamond-hilted sword in velvet scabbard, and
hawk on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wrist, <div class="bookquote">``the lord of the manor.''  (<font color='red'><b>The folk</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) flung himself into the
scales as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was lord of the zodiac as well as the manor: whereat the
hawk balanced and flapped; but stuck: then winked.

<p/>While the sexton heaved in the great weights, the cure told Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``My
lord had been sick unto death, and vowed his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) weight in bread and cheese
to the poor, the Church taking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tenth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Permit me, my lord; if your lordship continues to press your lordship's
staff on the other scale, you will disturb the balance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lordship grinned and removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) staff, and leaned on it. The cure
politely but firmly objected to that too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mille diables! what am I to do with it, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Deign to hold it out so, my lord, wide of both scales.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/>When my lord did this, and so fell into the trap he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had laid for
Holy Church, the good cure whispered to Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Cretensis incidit in
Cretensem!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which I take to mean, <div class="bookquote">``Diamond cut diamond.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then said
with an obsequious air, <div class="bookquote">``If that your lordship grudges Heaven full
weight, you might set the hawk on your lacquey, and so save a pound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gramercy for thy rede, cure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the great man, reproachfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall I for one sorry pound grudge my poor fowl the benefit of Holy
Church? I'd as lieve the devil should have me and all my house as her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),
any day i' the year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sweet is affection,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered the cure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Between a bird and a brute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>whispered Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tush!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the cure looked terrified.

<p/>The seigneur's weight was booked, and Heaven I trust and believe did not
weigh his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gratitude in the balance of the sanctuary. For my unlearned
reader is not to suppose there was anything the least eccentric in the
man, or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gratitude to the Giver of health and all good gifts. Men
look forward to death, and back upon past sickness with different eyes.
Item, when men drive a bargain, they strive to get the sunny side of
it; it matters not one straw whether it is with man or Heaven they are
bargaining. In this respect we are the same now, at bottom, as we were
four hundred years ago: only in those days we did it a grain or two more
naively, and that naivete shone out more palpably, because, in that rude
age, body prevailing over mind, all sentiments took material forms.
Man repented with scourges, prayed by bead, bribed the saints with wax
tapers, put fish into the body to sanctify the soul, sojourned in cold
water for empire over the emotions, and thanked God for returning health
in 1 cwt. 2 stone 7 lb 3 oz. 1 dwt. of bread and cheese.

<p/>Whilst I have been preaching, who preach so rarely and so ill, the good
cure has been soliciting the lord of the manor to step into the church,
and give order what shall be done with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) great-great-grandfather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ods bodikins! what, have you dug him (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, my lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) never was buried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, the old dict was true after all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So true that the workmen this very day found a skeleton erect in the
pillar they are repairing. I had sent to my lord at once, but I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
would be here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)! `Tis he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>descendant</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) descendant, quickening his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) pace. <div class="bookquote">``Let us
go see the old boy. This youth is a stranger, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard bowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Know then that my great-great-grandfather held his (<font color='blue'><b>great-great-grandfather</b></font>) head high and being
on the point of death, revolted against lying under the aisle with his (<font color='blue'><b>great-great-grandfather</b></font>)
forbears for mean folk to pass over. So, as the tradition goes, he (<font color='blue'><b>great-great-grandfather</b></font>) swore
his (<font color='blue'><b>great-great-grandfather</b></font>) son -LRB-my great-grandfather-RRB-, to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>great-great-grandfather</b></font>) erect in one of the pillars
of the church''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-here they entered the porch-RRB-. ```For,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), `NO BASE
MAN SHALL PASS OVER MY STOMACH.' Peste!'' and even while speaking, his (<font color='blue'><b>MAN</b></font>)
lordship parried adroitly with his (<font color='blue'><b>MAN</b></font>) stick a skull that came hopping at
him (<font color='blue'><b>MAN</b></font>), bowled by a boy in the middle of the aisle, who took to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heels
yelling with fear the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had done. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lordship
hurled the skull furiously after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ran, at which the cure gave a
shout of dismay and put forth his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm to hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but was too late.

<p/>The cure groaned aloud. And as if this had evoked spirits of mischief,
up started a whole pack of children from some ambuscade, and unseen, but
heard loud enough, clattered out of the church like a covey rising in a
thick wood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! these pernicious brats,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the cure. <div class="bookquote">``The workmen cannot go to
their nonemete but the church is rife with them. Pray Heaven they have
not found his (<font color='blue'><b>great-great-grandfather</b></font>) late lordship; nay, I mind, I hid his (<font color='blue'><b>great-great-grandfather</b></font>) lordship under a
workmen's jerkin, and--saints defend us! the jerkin has been moved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor cure's worst misgivings were realized: the rising generation
of the plebians had played the mischief with the haughty old noble. <div class="bookquote">``The
little ones had jockeyed for the bones oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and pocketed such of them as
seemed adapted for certain primitive games then in vogue amongst them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll excommunicate them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>roared the curate, <div class="bookquote">``and all their race.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never heed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the scapegrace lord</b></font>)</div>said the scapegrace lord: and stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hawk; <div class="bookquote">``there is
enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>great-great-grandfather</b></font>) to swear by. Put him (<font color='blue'><b>great-great-grandfather</b></font>) back! put him (<font color='blue'><b>great-great-grandfather</b></font>) back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the scapegrace lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, my lord, `tis your will his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) bones be laid in hallowed earth,
and masses said for his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) poor prideful soul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The noble stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hawk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are ye there, Master Cure?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Nay, the business is too old:
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is out of purgatory by this time, up or down. I shall not draw
my purse-strings for him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). Every dog his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) day. Adieu, Messires, adieu,
ancestor;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) sauntered off whistling to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hawk and caressing it.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) reverence looked ruefully after him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cretensis incidit in Cretensem,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) sorrowfully. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I
had him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) safe for a dozen masses. Yet I blame him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) not, but that young
ne’er-do-weel which did trundle his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) ancestor's skull at us: for who
could venerate his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) great-great-grandsire and play football with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
head? Well it behoves us to be better Christians than he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is.''  (<font color='red'><b>the workmen</b></font>)</div>So they
gathered the bones reverently, and the cure locked them up, and forbade
the workmen, who now entered the church, to close up the pillar, till he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
should recover by threats of the Church's wrath every atom of my lord.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) showed Gerard a famous shrine in the church. Before it were the
usual gifts of tapers, etc.. There was also a wax image of a falcon, most
curiously moulded and coloured to the life, eyes and all. Gerard's eye
fell at once on this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) expressed the liveliest admiration. The
cure assented. Then Gerard asked, <div class="bookquote">``Could the saint have loved hawking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>The cure laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) simplicity. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, `tis but a statuary hawk. When
they have a bird of gentle breed they cannot train, they make his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) image,
and send it to this shrine with a present, and pray the saint to work
upon the stubborn mind of the original, and make it ductile as wax: that
is the notion, and methinks a reasonable one, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard assented. <div class="bookquote">``But alack, reverend sir, were I a saint, methinks I
should side with the innocent dove, rather than with the cruel hawk that
rends her (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By St. Denys you are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the cure. <div class="bookquote">``But, que voulez-vous?
the saints are debonair, and have been flesh themselves, and know man's
frailty and absurdity. `Tis the Bishop of Avignon sent this one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! do bishops hawk in this country?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One and all. Every noble person hawks, and lives with hawk on wrist.
Why, my lord abbot hard by, and his (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) lordship that has just parted from
us, had a two years' feud as to where they should put their hawks down
on that very altar there. Each claimed the right hand of the altar for
his (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) bird.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What desecration!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay! nay! thou knowest we make them doff both glove and hawk to take
the blessed eucharist. Their jewelled gloves will they give to a servant
or simple Christian to hold: but their beloved hawks they will put down
on no place less than the altar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard inquired how the battle of the hawks ended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the abbot he (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) yielded, as the Church yields to laymen. He (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) searched
ancient books, and found that the left hand was the more honourable,
being in truth the right hand, since the altar is east, but looks
westward. So he (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) gave my lord the soi-disant right hand, and contented
himself with the real right hand, and even so may the Church still
outwit the lay nobles and their arrogance, saving your presence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir, I honour the Church. I am convent bred, and owe all I have
and am to Holy Church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that accounts for my sudden liking to thee. Art a gracious youth.
Come and see me whenever thou wilt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard took this as a hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) might go now. It jumped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own
wish, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was curious to hear what Denys had seen and done all this
time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) reverence and walked out of the church; but was
no sooner clear of it than he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) set off to run with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) might: and
tearing round a corner, ran into a large stomach, whose owner clutched
him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), to keep himself steady under the shock; but did not release his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
hold on regaining his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) equilibrium.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let go, man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so. You are my prisoner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prisoner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for, in Heaven's name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for? Why, sorcery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``SORCERY?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorcery.''



 (<font color='red'><b>The culprits</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXVII

<p/>The culprits were condemned to stand pinioned in the marketplace for two
hours, that should any persons recognize them or any of them as guilty
of other crimes, they might depose to that effect at the trial.

<p/>They stood, however, the whole period, and no one advanced anything
fresh against them. This was the less remarkable that they were night
birds, vampires who preyed in the dark on weary travellers, mostly
strangers.

<p/>But just as they were being taken down, a fearful scream was heard in
the crowd, and a woman pointed at one of them, with eyes almost starting
from their sockets: but ere she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could speak she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fainted away.

<p/>Then men and women crowded round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), partly to aid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), partly from
curiosity. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to recover they fell to conjectures.

<p/>```Twas at him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pointed.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, `twas at this one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another, ```twas at yon hangdog with the hair hung round
his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) neck.''

<p/>All further conjectures were cut short. The poor creature no sooner
recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) senses than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flew at the landlord like a lioness.
<div class="bookquote">``My child! Man! man! Give me back my child.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seized the glossy
golden hair that the officers had hung round his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) neck, and tore it
from his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) neck, and covered it with kisses; then, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poor confused mind
clearing, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw even by this token that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lost girl was dead, and
sank suddenly down shrieking and sobbing so over the poor hair, that the
crowd rushed on the assassin with one savage growl. His (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) life had ended
then and speedily, for in those days all carried death at their girdles.
But Denys drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sword directly, and shouting <div class="bookquote">``A moi, camarades!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>kept
the mob at bay. <div class="bookquote">``Who lays a finger on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dies.''  (<font color='red'><b>archers</b></font>)</div>Other archers backed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), and with some difficulty they kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) uninjured, while Denys
appealed to those who shouted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) blood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of vengeance is this? would you be so mad as rob the wheel,
and give the vermin an easy death?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the archers</b></font>)</div><p/>The mob was kept passive by the archers' steel rather than by Denys's
words, and growled at intervals with flashing eyes. The municipal
officers, seeing this, collected round, and with the archers made a
guard, and prudently carried the accused back to gaol.

<p/>The mob hooted them and the prisoners indiscriminately. Denys saw the
latter safely lodged, then made for <div class="bookquote">``The White Hart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>where he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) expected
to find Gerard.

<p/>On the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) saw two girls working at a first-floor window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) saluted
them. They smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) entered into conversation. Their manners were
easy, their complexion high.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) invited them to a repast at <div class="bookquote">``The White Hart.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>They objected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
acquiesced in their refusal. They consented. And in this charming
society he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) forgot all about poor Gerard, who meantime was carried off to
gaol; but on the way suddenly stopped, having now somewhat recovered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) presence of mind, and demanded to know by whose authority he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was
arrested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the vice-baillie's,''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>said the constable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The vice-baillie? Alas! what have I, a stranger, done to offend a
vice-baillie? For this charge of sorcery must be a blind. No sorcerer am
I; but a poor true lad far from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div><p/>This vague shift disgusted the officer. <div class="bookquote">``Show him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) the capias, Jacques,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).

<p/>Jacques held out the writ in both hands about a yard and a half from
Gerard's eye; and at the same moment the large constable suddenly pinned
him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>); both officers were on tenterhooks lest the prisoner should grab the
document, to which they attached a superstitious importance.

<p/>But the poor prisoner had no such thought. Query whether he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would have
touched it with the tongs. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) just craned out his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) neck and read it, and
to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) infinite surprise found the vice-bailiff who had signed the writ
was the friendly alderman. He (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) took courage and assured his (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) captor there
was some error. But finding he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) made no impression, demanded to be taken
before the alderman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What say you to that, Jacques?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible. We have no orders to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) before his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) worship. Read the
writ!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, but good kind fellows, what harm can it be? I will give you each
an ecu.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jacques, what say you to that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! I say we have no orders not to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) worship. Read the
writ!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then say we take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) to prison round by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) worship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was agreed. They got the money; and bade Gerard observe they were
doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a favour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw they wanted a little gratitude as well as
much silver. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tried to satisfy this cupidity, but it stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
throat. Feigning was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) forte.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) entered the alderman's presence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mouth, and
begged with faltering voice to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had done to offend since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
left that very room with Manon and Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nought that I know of,''  (<font color='red'><b>the alderman</b></font>)</div>said the alderman.

<p/>On the writ being shown him (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) told Gerard he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) had signed it at
daybreak. <div class="bookquote">``I get old, and my memory faileth me: a discussing of the girl
I quite forgot your own offence: but I remember now. All is well. You
are he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) I committed for sorcery. Stay! ere you go to gaol, you shall hear
what your accuser says: run and fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>), you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man could not find the accuser all at once. So the alderman, getting
impatient, told Gerard the main charge was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had set a dead body a
burning with diabolical fire, that flamed, but did not consume. <div class="bookquote">``And if
`tis true, young man, I'm sorry for thee, for thou wilt assuredly burn
with fire of good pine logs in the market-place of Neufchasteau.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, for pity's sake let me have speech with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reverence the
cure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The alderman</b></font>)</div><p/>The alderman advised Gerard against it. <div class="bookquote">``The Church was harder upon
sorcerers than was the corporation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, sir, I am innocent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, between snarling and whining.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you think you are innocent--officer, go with him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) to the cure;
but see he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) `scape you not. Innocent, quotha?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They found the cure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) doublet repairing a wheelbarrow. Gerard
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) all, and appealed piteously to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Just for using a little
phosphorus in self-defence against cut-throats they are going to hang.''

 (<font color='red'><b>magician</b></font>)</div><p/>It was lucky for our magician that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had already told his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tale in full
to the cure, for thus that shrewd personage had hold of the stick at the
right end. The corporation held it by the ferule. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reverence looked
exceedingly grave and said, <div class="bookquote">``I must question you privately on this
untoward business.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) into a private room and bade the officer
stand outside and guard the door, and be ready to come if called. The
big constable stood outside the door, quaking, and expecting to see the
room fly away and leave a stink of brimstone. Instantly they were alone
the cure unlocked his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) countenance and was himself again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Show me the trick on't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), all curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot, sir, unless the room be darkened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The cure speedily closed out the light with a wooden shutter. <div class="bookquote">``Now,
then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But on what shall I put it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Here is no dead face. `Twas
that made it look so dire.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The cure groped about the room. <div class="bookquote">``Good; here
is an image: `tis my patron saint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid! That were profanation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw! `twill rub off, will't not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but it goes against me to take such liberty with a saint,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sorcerer</b></font>)</div>objected
the sorcerer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fiddlestick!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the divine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure by putting it on his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) holiness will show your reverence it is
no Satanic art.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mayhap `twas for that I did propose it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the cure subtly.

<p/>Thus encouraged, Gerard fired the eyes and nostrils of the image and
made the cure jump. Then lighted up the hair in patches; and set the
whole face shining like a glow-worm's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By'r Lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>a magician</b></font>)</div>shouted the cure, ```tis strange, and small my wonder that
they took you for a magician, seeing a dead face thus fired. Now come
thy ways with me!''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>magician</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>magician</b></font>) grey gown and great hat, and in a few minutes they found
themselves in presence of the alderman. By his (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) side, poisoning his (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) mind,
stood the accuser, a singular figure in red hose and red shoes, a black
gown with blue bands, and a cocked hat.

<p/>After saluting the alderman, the cure turned to this personage and said
good-humouredly, <div class="bookquote">``So, Mangis, at thy work again, babbling away honest
men's lives! Come, your worship, this is the old tale! two of a trade
can ne’er agree. Here is Mangis, who professes sorcery, and would sell
himself to Satan to-night, but that Satan is not so weak as buy what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) can have gratis, this Mangis, who would be a sorcerer, but is only
a quacksalver, accuses of magic a true lad, who did but use in
self-defence a secret of chemistry well-known to me and all churchmen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this personage</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is no churchman, to dabble in such mysteries,''  (<font color='red'><b>the alderman</b></font>)</div>objected the
alderman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>churchman</b></font>) is more churchman than layman, being convent bred, and in the lesser
orders,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the ready cure. <div class="bookquote">``Therefore, sorcerer, withdraw thy plaint
without more words!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I will not, your reverence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mangis</b></font>)</div>replied Mangis stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``A sorcerer I
am, but a white one, not a black one. I make no pact with Satan, but on
the contrary still battle him (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) with lawful and necessary arts, I ne’er
profane the sacraments, as do the black sorcerers, nor turn myself into
a cat and go sucking infants' blood, nor e'en their breath, nor set dead
men o' fire. I but tell the peasants when their cattle and their hens
are possessed, and at what time of the moon to plant rye, and what days
in each month are lucky for wooing of women and selling of bullocks
and so forth: above all, it is my art and my trade to detect the black
magicians, as I did that whole tribe of them who were burnt at Dol but
last year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, Mangis. And what is the upshot of that famous fire thy tongue did
kindle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, their ashes were cast to the wind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay. But the true end of thy comedy is this. The parliament of Dijon
hath since sifted the matter, and found they were no sorcerers, but good
and peaceful citizens; and but last week did order masses to be said for
their souls, and expiatory farces and mysteries to be played for them
in seven towns of Burgundy; all which will not of those cinders make men
and women again. Now `tis our custom in this land, when we have slain
the innocent by hearkening false knaves like thee, not to blame our
credulous ears, but the false tongue that gulled them. Therefore bethink
thee that, at a word from me to my lord bishop, thou wilt smell burning
pine nearer than e'er knave smelt it and lived, and wilt travel on a
smoky cloud to him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) whose heart thou bearest -LRB-for the word devil in the
Latin it meaneth `false accuser'-RRB-, and whose livery thou wearest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>staff</b></font>)</div><p/>And the cure pointed at Mangis with his (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) staff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true i'fegs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the alderman</b></font>)</div>said the alderman, <div class="bookquote">``for red and black be the foul
fiendys colours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the alderman</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time the white sorcerer's cheek was as colourless as his (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) dress
was fiery. Indeed the contrast amounted to pictorial. He (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) stammered out,
<div class="bookquote">``I respect Holy Church and her (<font color='blue'><b>accuser</b></font>) will; he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) shall fire the churchyard, and
all in it, for me: I do withdraw the plaint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then withdraw thyself,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the vice-bailiff.

<p/>The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) was gone the cure took the conversational tone, and told
the alderman courteously that the accused had received the chemical
substance from Holy Church, and had restored it her (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>), by giving it all to
him (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then `tis in good hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply; <div class="bookquote">``young man, you are free. Let
me have your reverence's prayers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubt it not! Humph! Vice-baillie, the town owes me four silver franks,
this three months and more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They shall be paid, cure, ay, ere the week be out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>On this good understanding Church and State parted. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) was in
the street Gerard caught the priest's hand, and kissed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir! Oh, your reverence. You have saved me from the fiery stake.
What can I say, what do? what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nought, foolish lad. Bounty rewards itself. Natheless--Humph?--I wish
I had done't without leasing. It ill becomes my function to utter
falsehoods.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Falsehood, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>Gerard was mystified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didst not hear me say thou hadst given me that same phosphorus? `Twill
cost me a fortnight's penance, that light word.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The cure sighed, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eye twinkled cunningly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Now Heaven forbid! That was no
falsehood, father: well you knew the phosphorus was yours, is yours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thrust the bottle into the cure's hand. <div class="bookquote">``But alas, `tis too poor
a gift: will you not take from my purse somewhat for Holy Church?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) purse with glistening eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the other brusquely, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands quickly behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>);
<div class="bookquote">``not a doit. Fie! fie! art pauper et exul. Come thou rather each day at
noon and take thy diet with me; for my heart warms to thee;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went
off very abruptly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>They itched.

<p/>But they itched in vain.

<p/>Where there's a heart there's a Rubicon.

<p/>Gerard went hastily to the inn to relieve Denys of the anxiety so long
and mysterious an absence must have caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) seated
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ease, playing dice with two young ladies whose manners were
unreserved, and complexion high.

<p/>Gerard was hurt. <div class="bookquote">``N’oubliez point la Jeanneton!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), colouring up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What of her (<font color='blue'><b>pauper</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, gaily rattling the dice.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>pauper</b></font>) said, `Le peu que sont les femmes.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, did she (<font color='blue'><b>pauper</b></font>)? And what say you to that, mesdemoiselles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We say that none run women down, but such as are too old, or too
ill-favoured, or too witless to please them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Witless, quotha? Wise men have not folly enough to please them, nor
madness enough to desire to please them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard loftily; <div class="bookquote">``but `tis
to my comrade I speak, not to you, you brazen toads, that make so free
with a man at first sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Preach away, comrade. Fling a byword or two at our heads. Know, girls,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) is a very Solomon for bywords. Methinks he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was brought up by
hand on `em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be thy friendship a byword!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>retorted Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``The friendship that
melts to nought at sight of a farthingale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Malheureux!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys, <div class="bookquote">``I speak but pellets, and thou answerest
daggers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply. <div class="bookquote">``Adieu.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a little savage!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>said one of the girls.

<p/>Gerard opened the door and put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I have thought of a
byword,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) spitefully--

<p/>``Qui hante femmes et dez
Il mourra en pauvretez.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And having delivered this thunderbolt of antique wisdom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
slammed the door viciously ere any of them could retort.

<p/>And now, being somewhat exhausted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) anxieties, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went to the bar
for a morsel of bread and a cup of wine. The landlord would sell nothing
less than a pint bottle. Well then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would have a bottle; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
came to compare the contents of the bottle with its size, great was the
discrepancy: on this he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) examined the bottle keenly, and found that
the glass was thin where the bottle tapered, but towards the bottom
unnaturally thick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pointed this out at once.

<p/>The landlord answered superciliously that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did not make bottles: and
was nowise accountable for their shape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That we will see presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``I will take this thy pint to
the vice-bailiff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, for Heaven's sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the landlord, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tone at
once. <div class="bookquote">``I love to content my customers. If by chance this pint be short,
we will charge it and its fellow three sous insteads of two sous each.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it. But much I admire that you, the host of so fair an inn,
should practise thus. The wine, too, smacketh strongly of spring water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Young sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``we cut no travellers' throats at this
inn, as they do at most. However, you know all about that, `The White
Hart' is no lion, nor bear. Whatever masterful robbery is done here, is
done upon the poor host. How then could he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) live at all if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) dealt not a
little crooked with the few who pay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard objected to this system root and branch. Honest trade was small
profits, quick returns; and neither to cheat nor be cheated.

<p/>The landlord sighed at this picture. <div class="bookquote">``So might one keep an inn in
heaven, but not in Burgundy. When foot soldiers going to the wars are
quartered on me, how can I but lose by their custom? Two sous per day is
their pay, and they eat two sous' worth, and drink into the bargain. The
pardoners are my good friends, but palmers and pilgrims, what think you
I gain by them? marry, a loss. Minstrels and jongleurs draw custom and
so claim to pay no score, except for liquor. By the secular monks I
neither gain nor lose, but the black and grey friars have made vow
of poverty, but not of famine; eat like wolves and give the poor host
nought but their prayers; and mayhap not them: how can he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) tell? In my
father's day we had the weddings; but now the great gentry let their
houses and their plates, their mugs and their spoons to any honest
couple that want to wed, and thither the very mechanics go with their
brides and bridal train. They come not to us: indeed we could not find
seats and vessels for such a crowd as eat and drink and dance the week
out at the homeliest wedding now. In my father's day the great gentry
sold wine by the barrel only; but now they have leave to cry it, and
sell it by the galopin, in the very market-place. How can we vie with
them? They grow it. We buy it of the grower. The coroner's quests we
have still, and these would bring goodly profit, but the meat is aye
gone ere the mouths be full.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should make better provision,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hearer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The law will not let us. We are forbidden to go into the market for
the first hour. So, when we arrive, the burghers have bought all but the
refuse. Besides, the law forbids us to buy more than three bushels
of meal at a time: yet market day comes but once a week. As for the
butchers, they will not kill for us unless we bribe them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard kindly, <div class="bookquote">``the shoe pinches every trader
somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ay: but not as it pinches us. Our shoe is trode all o' one side as well
as pinches us lame. A savoir, if we pay not the merchants we buy meal,
meat, and wine of, they can cast us into prison and keep us there till
we pay or die. But we cannot cast into prison those who buy those very
victuals of us. A traveller's horse we may keep for his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) debt; but where,
in Heaven's name? In our own stable, eating his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) head off at our cost.
Nay, we may keep the traveller himself; but where? In gaol? Nay, in
our own good house, and there must we lodge and feed him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) gratis. And so
fling good silver after bad? Merci; no: let him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) go with a wanion. Our
honestest customers are the thieves. Would to Heaven there were more of
them. They look not too close into the shape of the canakin, nor into
the host's reckoning: with them and with their purses `tis lightly come,
and lightly go. Also they spend freely, not knowing but each carouse may
be their last. But the thief-takers, instead of profiting by this
fair example, are for ever robbing the poor host. When noble or honest
travellers descend at our door, come the Provost's men pretending to
suspect them, and demanding to search them and their papers. To save
which offence the host must bleed wine and meat. Then come the excise to
examine all your weights and measures. You must stop their mouths with
meat and wine. Town excise. Royal excise. Parliament excise. A swarm
of them, and all with a wolf in their stomachs and a sponge in their
gullets. Monks, friars, pilgrims, palmers, soldiers, excisemen,
provost-marshals and men, and mere bad debtors, how can `The White Hart'
butt against all these? Cutting no throats in self-defence as do your
`Swans' and `Roses' and `Boar's Heads' and `Red Lions' and `Eagles,'
your `Moons,' `Stars,' and `Moors,' how can `The White Hart' give a pint
of wine for a pint? And everything risen so. Why, lad, not a pound of
bread I sell but cost me three good copper deniers, twelve to the sou;
and each pint of wine, bought by the tun, costs me four deniers; every
sack of charcoal two sous, and gone in a day. A pair of partridges five
sous. What think you of that? Heard one ever the like? five sous for two
little beasts all bone and feather? A pair of pigeons, thirty deniers.
`Tis ruination!!! For we may not raise our pricen with the market. Oh,
no, I tell thee the shoe is trode all o' one side as well as pinches the
water into our eyn. We may charge nought for mustard, pepper, salt,
or firewood. Think you we get them for nought? Candle it is a sou the
pound. Salt five sous the stone, pepper four sous the pound, mustard
twenty deniers the pint; and raw meat, dwindleth it on the spit with no
cost to me but loss of weight? Why, what think you I pay my cook? But
you shall never guess. A HUNDRED SOUS A YEAR AS I AM A LIVING SINNER.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And my waiter thirty sous, besides his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) perquisites. He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) is a hantle

another town, stopping, halting, or passing: those be the words. They
can fine us before the bailiff if we refuse them, mass or no mass;
and say a townsman should creep in with the true travellers, are we to
blame? They all vow they are tired wayfarers; and can I ken every face
in a great town like this? So if we respect the law our poor souls are

 (<font color='red'><b>readers</b></font>)</div><p/>So luckily for my readers, though not for all concerned, this injured
orator was arrested in mid career. Another man burst in upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrongs
with all the advantage of a recent wrong; a wrong red hot. It was Denys
cursing and swearing and crying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was robbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did those hussies pass this way? who are they? where do they bide? They

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried the landlord to Gerard.

<p/>Gerard implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to be calm, and say how it had befallen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First one went out on some pretence: then after a while the other went
to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>vipers</b></font>) back, and neither returning, I clapped hand to purse and
found it empty: the ungrateful creatures, I was letting them win it in a
gallop: but loaded dice were not quick enough; they must claw it all in
a lump.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard was for going at once to the alderman and setting the officers to
find them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys. <div class="bookquote">``I hate the law. No: as it came so let it go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard would not give it up so.

<p/>At a hint from the landlord he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) forced Denys along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to the
provost-marshal. That dignitary shook his (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) head. ``We have no clue to
occasional thieves, that work honestly at their needles, till some gull

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys furiously. <div class="bookquote">``I knew what use a bourgeois would

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are clear of the town ere this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak no more on't if you prize my friendship. I have five pieces with

I. What saidst thou at the door? No matter. Well, then, I did offer
marriage to that Manon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard was dumfounded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? You offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marriage. Is that such a mighty strange thing to offer a wench?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis a strange thing to offer to a strange girl in passing.''

<p/>``Nay, I am not such a sot as you opine. I saw the corn in all that
chaff. I knew I could not get her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) by fair means, so I was fain to try
foul. `Mademoiselle,' said I, `marriage is not one of my habits, but
struck by your qualities I make an exception; deign to bestow this hand
on me.'''

<p/>``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) bestowed it on thine ear.'''

<p/>``Not so. On the contrary she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>)--Art a disrespectful young monkey. Know
that here, not being Holland or any other barbarous state, courtesy
begets courtesy. Says she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>), a colouring like a rose, `Soldier, you are
too late. He (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) is not a patch on you for looks; but then--he (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) has loved me
a long time.'

<p/>```He (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>)? who?'

<p/>```T’other.'

<p/>```What other?'

<p/>``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) that was not too late.' Oh, that is the way they all speak, the
loves; the she-wolves. Their little minds go in leaps. Think you they
marshal their words in order of battle? Their tongues are in too great
a hurry. Says she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), `I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) not; not to say love him (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) does me,
and dearly; and for that reason I'd sooner die than cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) grief, I
would.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did love him (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Who doubts that? Why she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said so, round about, as they always say these
things, and with `nay' for `ay.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well one thing led to another, and at last, as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could not give me
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gave me a piece of advice, and that was to leave part of
my money with the young mistress. Then, when bad company had cleaned me
out, I should have some to travel back with, said she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). I said I would
better her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) advice, and leave it with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) face got red. Says she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>),
`Think what you do. Chambermaids have an ill name for honesty.' `Oh, the
devil is not so black as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is painted,' said I. `I'll risk it;' and I
left fifteen gold pieces with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you may ever see them again. It is wondrous in
what esteem you do hold this sex, to trust so to the first comer. For my
part I know little about them; I never saw but one I could love as well

cheap. `Levius quid femina,' said they, which is but la Jeanneton's
tune in Latin, `Le peu que sont les femmes.' Also do but see how the
greybeards of our own day speak of them, being no longer blinded by
desire: this alderman, to wit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, novice of novices,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys, <div class="bookquote">``not to have seen why that old

piece of bad taste, and ten to one `twas good taste, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) doth bespatter
creation's fairer half, thereby proving what? le peu que sont les

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see women have a shrewd champion in thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, with a smile.
But the next moment inquired gravely why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had not told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) all this
before.

<p/>Denys grinned. <div class="bookquote">``Had the girl said `Ay,' why then I had told thee
straight. But `tis a rule with us soldiers never to publish our defeats:
`tis much if after each check we claim not a victory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Young as I am, I have seen this; that
after every great battle the generals on both sides go to the nearest
church, and sing each a Te Deum for the victory; methinks a Te Martem,
or Te Bellonam, or Te Mercurium, Mercury being the god of lies, were
more fitting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pas si bete,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys approvingly. <div class="bookquote">``Hast a good eye: canst see a
steeple by daylight. So now tell me how thou hast fared in this town all
day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, ```tis well thou hast asked me: for else I had never
told thee.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then related in full how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been arrested, and by
what a providential circumstance he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had escaped long imprisonment or
speedy conflagration.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) narrative produced an effect he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) little expected or desired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a traitor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>cried Denys. <div class="bookquote">``I left thee in a strange place to fight
thine own battles, while I shook the dice with those jades. Now take
thou this sword and pass it through my body forthwith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for in Heaven's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>inquired Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For an example,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>roared Denys. <div class="bookquote">``For a warning to all false loons that
profess friendship, and disgrace it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. Not a bad notion. Where will you
have it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, through my heart; that is, where other men have a heart, but I
none, or a Satanic false one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard made a motion to run him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) through, and flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
neck instead. <div class="bookquote">``I know no way to thy heart but this, thou great silly
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys uttered an exclamation, then hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) warmly--and, quite
overcome by this sudden turn of youthful affection and native grace,
gulped out in a broken voice, <div class="bookquote">``Railest on women--and art--like
them--with thy pretty ways. Thy mother's milk is in thee still. Satan
would love thee, or--le bon Dieu would kick him (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) out of hell for shaming

let thee out of my sight till Italy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the friends</b></font>)</div><p/>And so the staunch friends were more than reconciled after their short
tiff.

<p/>The next day the thieves were tried. The pieces de conviction were
reduced in number, to the great chagrin of the little clerk, by the
interment of the bones. But there was still a pretty show. A thief's
hand struck off flagrante delicto; a murdered woman's hair; the Abbot's
axe, and other tools of crime. The skulls, etc., were sworn to by the
constables who had found them. Evidence was lax in that age and place.
They all confessed but the landlord. And Manon was called to bring the
crime home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) evidence was conclusive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) made a vain attempt
to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) credibility by drawing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) own sweetheart had
been one of the gang, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) had held her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) tongue so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>)
was alive. The public prosecutor came to the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) witness,
and elicited that a knife had been held to her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) throat, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) own
sweetheart sworn with solemn oaths to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) should she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) betray them,
and that this terrible threat, and not the mere fear of death, had glued
her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) lips.

<p/>The other thieves were condemned to be hanged, and the landlord to be
broken on the wheel. He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) uttered a piercing cry when his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) sentence was
pronounced.

<p/>As for poor Manon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) became the subject of universal criticism. Nor
did opinion any longer run dead in her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) favour; it divided into two broad
currents. And strange to relate, the majority of her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) own sex took her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>)
part, and the males were but equally divided; which hardly happens once
in a hundred years. Perhaps some lady will explain the phenomenon. As
for me, I am a little shy of explaining things I don't understand. It
has become so common. Meantime, had she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) been a lover of notoriety, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
would have been happy, for the town talked of nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The poor
girl, however, had but one wish to escape the crowd that followed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
and hide her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head somewhere where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could cry over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``pendard,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>whom all these proceedings brought vividly back to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) affectionate
remembrance. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was hanged he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
was not one of your fastidious girls, who love their male divinities any
the less for beating them, kicking them, or killing them, but rather
the better, provided these attentions are interspersed with occasional
caresses; so it would have been odd indeed had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) taken offence at a
mere threat of that sort. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had never threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with a rival. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
sobbed single-mindedly.

<p/>Meantime the inn was filled with thirsters for a sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), who
feasted and drank, to pass away the time till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should deign to
appear. When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been sobbing some time, there was a tap at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
door, and the landlord entered with a proposal. ``Nay, weep not, good
lass, your fortune it is made an you like. Say the word, and you are
chambermaid of `The White Hart.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manon</b></font>)</div>said Manon with a fresh burst of grief. <div class="bookquote">``Never more will I
be a servant in an inn. I'll go to my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlord consoled and coaxed her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>): and she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) became calmer, but none
the less determined against his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) proposal.

<p/>The landlord left her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>). But ere long he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) returned and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) another
proposal. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) be his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) wife, and landlady of <div class="bookquote">``The White Hart'' (<font color='red'><b>landlady</b></font>)</div>?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do ill to mock me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) sorrowfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sweetheart. I mock thee not. I am too old for sorry jests. Say you
the word, and you are my partner for better for worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), and saw he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was in earnest: on this she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) suddenly
rained hard to the memory of <div class="bookquote">``le pendard'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>: the tears came in a torrent,
being the last; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) hand to the landlord of <div class="bookquote">``The White
Hart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and broke a gold crown with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) in sign of plighted troth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will keep it dark till the house is quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but meantime prithee give me linen to hem, or work to
do; for the time hangs on me like lead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) betrothed's eye brightened at this housewifely request, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) up two dozen flagons of various sizes to clean and polish.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) gathered complacency as she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) reflected that by a strange turn of
fortune all this bright pewter was to be hers.

<p/>Meantime the landlord went downstairs, and falling in with our friends
drew them aside into the bar.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) then addressed Denys with considerable solemnity. <div class="bookquote">``We are old
acquaintances, and you want not for sagacity: now advise me in a strait.
My custom is somewhat declining: this girl Manon is the talk of the
town; see how full the inn is to-night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) doth refuse to be my
chambermaid. I have half a mind to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>). What think you? shall I
say the word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys in reply merely open his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) eyes wide with amazement.

<p/>The landlord turned to Gerard with a half-inquiring look,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard; <div class="bookquote">``I am too young to advise my seniors and
betters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter. Let us hear your thought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, it was said of a good wife by the ancients, `bene quae
latuit, bene vixit,' that is, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is the best wife that is least talked
of: but here `male quae patuit' were as near the mark. Therefore, an
you bear the lass good-will, why not club purses with Denys and me and
convey her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) safe home with a dowry? Then mayhap some rustical person in
her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) own place may be brought to wife her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so many words?''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys. <div class="bookquote">``This old fox is not the ass he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) affects
to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! that is your advice, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord testily. <div class="bookquote">``Well then
we shall soon know who is the fool, you or me, for I have spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)
as it happens; and what is more, she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) has said Ay, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) is polishing
the flagons at this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys drily, ```twas an ambuscade. Well, in that case, my
advice is, run for the notary, tie the noose, and let us three drink the
bride's health, till we see six sots a-tippling.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall. Ay, now you utter sense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a clerk friends</b></font>)</div><p/>In ten minutes a civil marriage was effected upstairs before a notary
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) clerk and our two friends.

<p/>In ten minutes more the white hind, dead sick of seclusion, had taken
her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) place within the bar, and was serving out liquids, and bustling, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) colour rising a little.

<p/>In six little minutes more she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) soundly rated a careless servant-girl for
carrying a nipperkin of wine awry and spilling good liquor.

<p/>During the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) received across the bar eight offers of marriage,
some of them from respectable burghers. Now the landlord and our two
friends had in perfect innocence ensconced themselves behind a screen,
to drink at their ease the new couple's health. The above comedy was
thrown in for their entertainment by bounteous fate. They heard the
proposals made one after another, and uninventive Manon's invariable
answer--<div class="bookquote">``Serviteur; you are a day after the fair.''  (<font color='red'><b>Manon</b></font>)</div>The landlord chuckled
and looked good-natured superiority at both his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) late advisers, with
their traditional notions that men shun a woman <div class="bookquote">``quae patuit,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>i.e. who
has become the town talk.

<p/>But Denys scarce noticed the spouse's triumph over him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was so
occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) own over Gerard. At each municipal tender of undying
affection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) turned almost purple with the effort it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) not
to roar with glee; and driving his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) elbow into the deep-meditating
and much-puzzled pupil of antiquity, whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Le peu que sont les
hommes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the pupil</b></font>)</div><p/>The next morning Gerard was eager to start, but Denys was under a vow to
see the murderers of the golden-haired girl executed.

<p/>Gerard respected his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) vow, but avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) example.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went to bid the cure farewell instead, and sought and received his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
blessing. About noon the travellers got clear of the town. Just outside
the south gate they passed the gallows; it had eight tenants: the
skeleton of Manon's late wept, and now being fast forgotten, lover, and
the bodies of those who had so nearly taken our travellers' lives. A
hand was nailed to the beam. And hard by on a huge wheel was clawed the
dead landlord, with every bone in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) body broken to pieces.

<p/>Gerard averted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head and hurried by. Denys lingered, and crowed over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) dead foes. <div class="bookquote">``Times are changed, my lads, since we two sat shaking in
the cold awaiting you seven to come and cut our throats.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fie, Denys! Death squares all reckonings. Prithee pass on without
another word, if you prize my respect a groat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>To this earnest remonstrance Denys yielded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) even said thoughtfully,
<div class="bookquote">``You have been better brought up than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>About three in the afternoon they reached a little town with the people
buzzing in knots. The wolves, starved by the cold, had entered, and
eaten two grown-up persons overnight, in the main street: so some were
blaming the eaten--<div class="bookquote">``None but fools or knaves are about after nightfall;''
 (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>others the law for not protecting the town, and others the corporation
for not enforcing what laws there were.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! this is nothing to us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, and was for resuming their
march.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but `tis,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, are we the pair they ate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but we may be the next pair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, neighbour,''  (<font color='red'><b>an man tis</b></font>)</div>said an ancient man, ```tis the town's fault for not
obeying the ducal ordinance, which bids every shopkeeper light a lamp
o’er his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) door at sunset, and burn it till sunrise.''

<p/>On this Denys asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) somewhat derisively, <div class="bookquote">``What made him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) fancy rush
dips would scare away empty wolves? Why, mutton fat is all their joy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis not the fat, vain man, but the light. All ill things hate light;
especially wolves and the imps that lurk, I ween, under their fur.
Example; Paris city stands in a wood like, and the wolves do howl around
it all night: yet of late years wolves come but little in the streets.
For why, in that burgh the watchmen do thunder at each door that is
dark, and make the weary wight rise and light. `Tis my son tells me. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
is a great voyager, my son Nicholas.''

<p/>In further explanation he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) assured them that previously to that ordinance
no city had been worse infested with wolves than Paris; a troop had
boldly assaulted the town in 1420, and in 1438 they had eaten fourteen
persons in a single month between Montmartre and the gate St. Antoine,
and that not a winter month even, but September: and as for the
dead, which nightly lay in the streets slain in midnight brawls, or
assassinated, the wolves had used to devour them, and to grub up the
fresh graves in the churchyards and tear out the bodies.

<p/>Here a thoughtful citizen suggested that probably the wolves had been
bridled of late in Paris, not by candle-lights, but owing to the English
having been driven out of the kingdom of France. <div class="bookquote">``For those English be
very wolves themselves for fierceness and greediness. What marvel then
that under their rule our neighbours of France should be wolf-eaten?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This logic was too suited to the time and place not to be received
with acclamation. But the old man stood his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ground. <div class="bookquote">``I grant ye those
islanders are wolves; but two-legged ones, and little apt to favour
their four-footed cousins. One greedy thing loveth it another? I trow
not. By the same token, and this too I have from my boy Nicole, Sir Wolf
dare not show his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) nose in London city; though `tis smaller than Paris,
and thick woods hard by the north wall, and therein great store of deer,
and wild boars as rife as flies at midsummer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, ``you seem conversant with wild beasts, prithee
advise my comrade here and me: we would not waste time on the road, an
if we may go forward to the next town with reasonable safety.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young man, I trow `twere an idle risk. It lacks but an hour of dusk,
and you must pass nigh a wood where lurk some thousands of these
half-starved vermin, rank cowards single; but in great bands bold as
lions. Wherefore I rede you sojourn here the night; and journey on
betimes. By the dawn the vermin will be tired out with roaring and
rampaging; and mayhap will have filled their lank bellies with flesh of
my good neighbours here, the unteachable fools.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard hoped not; and asked could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) recommend them to a good inn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! there is the `Tete d’Or.' My grandaughter keeps it. She (<font color='blue'><b>bands</b></font>) is
a mijauree, but not so knavish as most hotel-keepers, and her (<font color='blue'><b>bands</b></font>) house
indifferent clean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Hey, for the `Tete d’Or,''' struck in Denys, decided by his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) ineradicable
foible.

<p/>On the way to it, Gerard inquired of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) companion what a <div class="bookquote">``mijauree''
 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>was?

<p/>Denys laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) ignorance. <div class="bookquote">``Not know what a mijauree is? why all
the world knows that. It is neither more nor less than a mijauree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>As they entered the <div class="bookquote">``Tete d’Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>they met a young lady richly dressed
with a velvet chaperon on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, which was confined by law to the
nobility. They unbonneted and louted low, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) curtsied, but fixed
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eye on vacancy the while, which had a curious rather than a genial
effect. However, nobility was not so unassuming in those days as it
is now. So they were little surprised. But the next minute supper was
served, and lo! in came this princess and carved the goose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Holy St. Bavon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard. ```Twas the landlady all the while.''

<p/>A young woman, cursed with nice white teeth and lovely hands: for these
beauties being misallied to homely features, had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was a feeble carver, carving not for the sake of others but herself,
i.e. to display her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands. When not carving she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was eternally either
taking a pin out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head or her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) body, or else putting a pin into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
head or her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) body. To display her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) teeth, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laughed indifferently at gay
or grave and from ear to ear. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``sat at ease''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth ajar.

<p/>Now there is an animal in creation of no great general merit; but it has
the eye of a hawk for affectation. It is called <div class="bookquote">``a boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>And Gerard was
but a boy still in some things; swift to see, and to loath, affectation.
So Denys sat casting sheep's eyes, and Gerard daggers, at one comedian.

<p/>Presently, in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) minauderies, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave a loud shriek and
bounded out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chair like hare from form, and ran backwards out of
the room uttering little screams, and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) farthingale tight down
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ankles with both hands. And as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) scuttled out of the door a
mouse scuttled back to the wainscot in a state of equal, and perhaps
more reasonable terror. The guests, who had risen in anxiety at the
principal yell, now stood irresolute awhile, then sat down laughing. The
tender Denys, to whom a woman's cowardice, being a sexual trait, seemed
to be a lovely and pleasant thing, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) would go comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay! nay! nay! for pity's sake let her (<font color='blue'><b>bands</b></font>) bide,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard earnestly.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, blessed mouse! sure some saint sent thee to our aid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a burgher</b></font>)</div><p/>Now at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) right hand sat a sturdy middle-aged burgher, whose conduct up
to date had been cynical. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had never budged nor even rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knife
at all this fracas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) now turned on Gerard and inquired haughtily
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) really thought that <div class="bookquote">``grimaciere''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was afraid of a mouse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay. She (<font color='blue'><b>bands</b></font>) screamed hearty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the coquette that cannot scream to the life? These she (<font color='blue'><b>bands</b></font>)
tavern-keepers do still ape the nobles. Some princess or duchess hath
lain here a night, that was honestly afeard of a mouse, having been
brought up to it. And this ape hath seen her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), and said, `I will start
at a mouse, and make a coil,' She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) has no more right to start at a mouse
than to wear that fur on her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) bosom, and that velvet on her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) monkey's
head. I am of the town, young man, and have known the mijauree all her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
life, and I mind when she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was no more afeard of a mouse than she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) is of
a man.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was fast emptying the inn with these
<div class="bookquote">``singeries.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All the world is so sick of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hands, that her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) very
kinsfolk will not venture themselves anigh them.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) concluded with
something like a sigh, ``The `Tete d’Or' was a thriving hostelry under my
old chum her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) good father; but she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) is digging its grave tooth and nail.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tooth and nail? good! a right merry conceit and a true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.
But the right merry conceit was an inadvertence as pure as snow, and
the stout burgher went to his (<font color='blue'><b>burgher</b></font>) grave and never knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>burgher</b></font>) had done:
for just then attention was attracted by Denys returning pompously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
inspected the apartment minutely, and with a high official air: he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) also
looked solemnly under the table; and during the whole inquisition a
white hand was placed conspicuously on the edge of the open door, and
a tremulous voice inquired behind it whether the horrid thing was quite
gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The enemy has retreated, bag and baggage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys: and handed in
the trembling fair, who, sitting down, apologized to her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) guests for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) foolish fears, with so much earnestness, grace, and seeming
self-contempt, that, but for a sour grin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) neighbour's face, Gerard
would have been taken in as all the other strangers were. Dinner ended,
the young landlady begged an Augustine friar at her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) right hand to say
grace. He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) delivered a longish one. The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) began, she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
white hands piously together, and held them up joined for mortals to
admire; `tis an excellent pose for taper white fingers: and cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
eyes upward towards heaven, and felt as thankful to it as a magpie does
while cutting off with your thimble.

<p/>After supper the two friends went to the street-door and eyed the
market-place. The mistress joined them, and pointed out the town-hall,
the borough gaol, St. Catherine's church, etc.. This was courteous, to
say the least. But the true cause soon revealed itself; the fair hand
was poked right under their eyes every time an object was indicated; and
Gerard eyed it like a basilisk, and longed for a bunch of nettles. The
sun set, and the travellers, few in number, drew round the great roaring
fire, and omitting to go on the spit, were frozen behind though roasted
in front. For if the German stoves were oppressively hot, the French
salles manger were bitterly cold, and above all stormy. In Germany men
sat bareheaded round the stove, and took off their upper clothes, but in
Burgundy they kept on their hats, and put on their warmest furs to sit
round the great open chimney places, at which the external air rushed
furiously from door and ill-fitting window. However, it seems their
mediaeval backs were broad enough to bear it: for they made themselves
not only comfortable but merry, and broke harmless jests over each
other in turn. For instance, Denys's new shoes, though not in direct
communication, had this day exploded with twin-like sympathy and
unanimity. <div class="bookquote">``Where do you buy your shoon, soldier?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked one.

<p/>Denys looked askant at Gerard, and not liking the theme, shook it off.
<div class="bookquote">``I gather `em off the trees by the roadside,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) surlily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you gathered these too ripe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hostess fool</b></font>)</div>said the hostess, who was only a
fool externally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, rotten ripe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>observed another, inspecting them.

<p/>Gerard said nothing, but pointed the circular satire by pantomime. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
slily put out both his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feet, one after another, under Denys's eye, with
their German shoes, on which a hundred leagues of travel had produced no
effect. They seemed hewn out of a rock.

<p/>At this, <div class="bookquote">``I'll twist the smooth varlet's neck that sold me mine,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>shouted Denys, in huge wrath, and confirmed the threat with singular
oaths peculiar to the mediaeval military. The landlady put her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) fingers
in her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) ears, thereby exhibiting the hand in a fresh attitude. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me
when he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) has done his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) orisons, somebody,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) mincingly. And after
that they fell to telling stories.

<p/>Gerard, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turn came, told the adventure of Denys and Gerard at
the inn in Domfront, and so well, that the hearers were rapt into sweet
oblivion of the very existence of mijauree and hands. But this made her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
very uneasy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had recourse to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) grand coup. This misdirected
genius had for a twelvemonth past practised yawning, and could do it
now at any moment so naturally as to set all creation gaping, could all
creation have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). By this means she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) got in all her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) charms. For
first she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) teeth, then, out of good breeding, you know, closed
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) mouth with three taper fingers. So the moment Gerard's story got too
interesting and absorbing, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) turned to and made yawns, and <div class="bookquote">``croix sur
la bouche.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was all very fine: but Gerard was an artist, and artists are
chilled by gaping auditors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bore up against the yawns a long time;
but finding they came from a bottomless reservoir, lost both heart and
temper, and suddenly rising in mid narrative, said, <div class="bookquote">``But I weary our
hostess, and I am tired myself: so good night!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>whipped a candle off the
dresser, whispered Denys, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot stand her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>and marched to bed in a
moment.

<p/>The mijauree coloured and bit her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had not intended her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) byplay
for Gerard's eye: and she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) saw in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had been rude, and silly,
and publicly rebuked. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) sat with cheek on fire, and a little natural
water in her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) eyes, and looked ten times comelier and more womanly
and interesting than she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had done all day. The desertion of the best
narrator broke up the party, and the unassuming Denys approached the
meditative mijauree, and invited her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) in the most flattering terms to
gamble with him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) started from her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) reverie, looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) down into the
earth's centre with chilling dignity, and consented, for she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) remembered
all in a moment what a show of hands gambling admitted.

<p/>The soldier and the mijauree rattled the dice. In which sport she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was so
taken up with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) hands, that she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) forgot to cheat, and Denys won an <div class="bookquote">``ecu
au soleil''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) fumbled slowly with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) purse, partly because her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
sex do not burn to pay debts of honour, partly to admire the play of
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) little knuckles peeping between their soft white cushions. Denys
proposed a compromise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Three silver franks I win of you, fair hostess. Give me now three
kisses of this white hand, and we'll e'en cry quits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are malapert,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, with a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``besides,
they are so dirty. See! they are like ink!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>and to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) put
them out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) and turned them up and down. They were no dirtier than
cream fresh from the cob and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew it: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was eternally washing and
scenting them.

<p/>Denys read the objection like the observant warrior he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was, seized them
and mumbled them.

<p/>Finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) so appreciative of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) charm, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said timidly, <div class="bookquote">``Will you do
me a kindness, good soldier?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A thousand, fair hostess, an you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I ask but one. `Tis to tell thy comrade I was right sorry to lose
his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) most thrilling story, and I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) will tell me the rest to-morrow
morning. Meantime I shall not sleep for thinking on't. Wilt tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilt</b></font>)
that--to pleasure me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, I'll tell the young savage. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilt</b></font>) is not worthy of your
condescension, sweet hostess. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilt</b></font>) would rather be aside a man than a
woman any day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So would--ahem. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is right: the young women of the day are not worthy
of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `un tas des mijaurees' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a good, honest, and right comely
face. Any way, I would not guest of mine should think me unmannerly, not
for all the world. Wilt keep faith with me and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On this fair hand I swear it; and thus I seal the pledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There; no need to melt the wax, though. Now go to bed. And tell him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) ere
you sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The perverse toad -LRB-I thank thee, Manon, for teaching me that word-RRB- was
inclined to bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) slight affections upon Gerard. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) was
inflammable: far less so than many that passed for prudes in the town.
But Gerard possessed a triple attraction that has ensnared coquettes in
all ages. 1. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was very handsome. 2. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did not admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) the least.
3. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) a good slap in the face.

<p/>Denys woke Gerard and gave the message. Gerard was not enchanted <div class="bookquote">``Dost
wake a tired man to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) that? Am I to be pestered with `mijaurees'
by night as well as day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I tell thee, novice, thou hast conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>): trust to my
experience: her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) voice sank to melodious whispers; and the cunning jade
did in a manner bribe me to carry thee her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) challenge to Love's lists!
for so I read her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) message.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys then, assuming the senior and the man of the world, told Gerard
the time was come to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) how a soldier understood friendship
and camaraderie. Italy was now out of the question. Fate had provided
better; and the blind jade Fortune had smiled on merit for once. <div class="bookquote">``The
Head of Gold''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>had been a prosperous inn, would be again with a man at
its head. A good general laid far-sighted plans; but was always ready
to abandon them, should some brilliant advantage offer, and to reap
the full harvest of the unforeseen: `twas chiefly by this trait great
leaders defeated little ones; for these latter could do nothing not cut
and dried beforehand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry friendship, that would marry me to a mijauree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>interposed
Gerard, yawning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Comrade, be reasonable; `tis not the friskiest sheep that falls down
the cliff. All creatures must have their fling soon, or late; and why
not a woman? What more frivolous than a kitten? what graver than a cat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hast a good eye for nature, Denys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, ``that I proclaim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A better for thine interest, boy. Trust then to me; these little doves
they are my study day and night; happy the man whose wife taketh her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)

down `em. Marriage it always changeth them for better or else for worse.
Why, Gerard, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is honest when all is done; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is no man, nor half
a man, that cannot mould any honest lass like a bit of warm wax, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)
aye aside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at bed and board. I tell thee in one month thou wilt make
of this coquette the matron the most sober in the town, and of all
its wives the one most docile and submissive. Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) is half tamed
already. Nine in ten meek and mild ones had gently hated thee like
poison all their lives, for wounding of their hidden pride. But she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) for
an affront proffers affection. By Joshua his (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) bugle a generous lass, and
void of petty malice. When thou wast gone she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) sat a-thinking and spoke
not. A sure sign of love in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) sex: for of all things else
they speak ere they think. Also her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) voice did sink exceeding low in
discoursing of thee, and murmured sweetly; another infallible sign. The
bolt hath struck and rankles in her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>); oh, be joyful! Art silent? I
see; `tis settled. I shall go alone to Remiremont, alone and sad. But,
pillage and poleaxes! what care I for that, since my dear comrade will
stay here, landlord of the `Tete d’Or,' and safe from all the storms
of life? Wilt think of me, Gerard, now and then by thy warm fire, of me
camped on some windy heath, or lying in wet trenches, or wounded on
the field and far from comfort? Nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and this he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said in a manner truly
noble, <div class="bookquote">``not comfortless or cold, or wet, or bleeding, `twill still warm
my heart to lie on my back and think that I have placed my dear friend
and comrade true in the `Tete d’Or,' far from a soldier's ills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I let you run on, dear Denys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard softly, <div class="bookquote">``because at each
word you show me the treasure of a good heart. But now bethink thee, my
troth is plighted there where my heart it clingeth. You so leal, would
you make me disloyal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perdition seize me, but I forgot that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more then, but hie thee to bed, good Denys. Next to Margaret I love
thee best on earth, and value thy `coeur d’or' far more than a dozen
of these `Tetes d’Or.' So prithee call me at the first blush of
rosy-fingered morn, and let's away ere the woman with the hands be
stirring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They rose with the dawn, and broke their fast by the kitchen fire.

<p/>Denys inquired of the girl whether the mistress was about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hath risen from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bed: by the same token I am carrying
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) this to clean her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) withal;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) filled a jug with boiling water,
and took it upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Behold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``the very elements must be warmed to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
skin; what had the saints said, which still chose the coldest pool?
Away, ere she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) come down and catch us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>They paid the score, and left the <div class="bookquote">``Tete d’Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>while its mistress was
washing her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hands.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII

<p/>Outside the town they found the snow fresh trampled by innumerable
wolves every foot of the road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We did well to take the old man's advice, Denys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay did we. For now I think on't, I did hear them last night scurrying
under our window, and howling and whining for man's flesh in yon
market-place. But no fat burgher did pity the poor vagabones, and drop
out o' window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard smiled, but with an air of abstraction. And they plodded on in
silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What dost meditate so profoundly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thy goodness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys was anything but pleased at this answer. Amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) oddities you
may have observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) could stand a great deal of real impertinence;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was so good-humoured. But would fire up now and then where not even
the shadow of a ground for anger existed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A civil question merits a civil reply,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) very drily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, I meant no other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why pretend you were thinking of my goodness, when you know I have
no goodness under my skin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had another said this, I had answered, `Thou liest.' But to thee I say,
`Hast no eye for men's qualities, but only for women's.' And once more I
do defy thy unreasonable choler, and say I was thinking on thy goodness
of overnight. Wouldst have wedded me to the `Tete d’Or' or rather to the
`tete de veau doree,' and left thyself solitary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, are ye there, lad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) good humour in a
moment. <div class="bookquote">``Well, but to speak sooth, I meant that not for goodness; but
for friendship and true fellowship, no more. And let me tell you, my
young master, my conscience it pricketh me even now for letting you turn
your back thus on fortune and peaceful days. A truer friend than I had
ta’en and somewhat hamstrung thee. Then hadst thou been fain to lie
smarting at the `Tete d’Or' a month or so; yon skittish lass had nursed
thee tenderly, and all had been well. Blade I had in hand to do't, but
remembering how thou hatest pain, though it be but a scratch, my craven
heart it failed me at the pinch.''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>And Denys wore a look of humble
apology for his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) lack of virtuous resolution when the path of duty lay so
clear.

<p/>Gerard raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyebrows with astonishment at this monstrous but
thoroughly characteristic revelation; however, this new and delicate
point of friendship was never discussed; viz., whether one ought in
all love to cut the tendon Achilles of one's friend. For an incident
interposed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here cometh one in our rear a-riding on his (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) neighbour's mule,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>shouted
Denys.

<p/>Gerard turned round. <div class="bookquote">``And how know ye `tis not his (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) own, pray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, blind! Because he (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) rides it with no discretion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>And in truth the man came galloping like a fury. But what astonished the
friends most was that on reaching them the rustic rider's eyes opened
saucer-like, and he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) drew the rein so suddenly and powerfully, that the
mule stuck out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fore-legs, and went sliding between the pedestrians
like a four-legged table on castors.

<p/>``I trow ye are from the `Tete d’Or?''' They assented. <div class="bookquote">``Which of ye is the
younger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) that was born the later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, winking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gramercy for the news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, divine then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall. Thy beard is ripe, thy fellow's is green; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shall be the
younger; here, youngster.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) out a paper packet. <div class="bookquote">``Ye left
this at the `Tete d’Or,' and our mistress sends it ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, good fellow, methinks I left nought.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>And Gerard felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pouch.
etc..

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would ye make our burgess a liar,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the rustic reproachfully; <div class="bookquote">``and
shall I have no pourboire?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-still more reproachfully-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``and came ventre
a terre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, thou shalt have pourboire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a small coin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A la bonne heure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clown</b></font>)</div>cried the clown, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) features beamed with
disproportionate joy. <div class="bookquote">``The Virgin go with ye; come up, Jenny!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and back
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went <div class="bookquote">``stomach to earth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nation is pleased to call it.

<p/>Gerard undid the packet; it was about six inches square, and inside it
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found another packet, which contained a packet, and so on. At the
fourth he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hurled the whole thing into the snow. Denys took it out
and rebuked his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) petulance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) excused himself on the ground of hating
affectation.

<p/>Denys attested, ```The great toe of the little daughter of Herodias'
there was no affectation here, but only woman's good wit. Doubtless the
wraps contained something which out of delicacy, or her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sex's lovely
cunning, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hind should see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bestow on a young man;
thy garter, to wit.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wear none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) own then; or a lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hair. What is this? A piece of raw silk
fresh from the worm. Well, of all the love tokens!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now who but thee ever dreamed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) is so naught as send me love
tokens? I saw no harm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)--barring her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay, here is something hard lurking in this soft nest. Come forth, I
say, little nestling! Saints and pikestaves! look at this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a gold ring with a great amethyst glowing and sparkling, full
coloured, but pure as crystal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How lovely!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard innocently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And here is something writ; read it thou! I read not so glib as some,
when I know not the matter beforehand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard took the paper. ```Tis a posy, and fairly enough writ.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) read
the lines, blushing like a girl. They were very naive, and may be thus
Englished:--

<p/>`Youth, with thee my heart is fledde,
Come back to the `golden Hedde!'
Wilt not? yet this token keepe
Of hir who doeth thy goeing weepe.
Gyf the world prove harsh and cold,
Come back to `the Hedde of gold.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The little dove!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>purred Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The great owl! To go and risk her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) good name thus. However, thank Heaven
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) has played this prank with an honest lad that will ne’er expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
folly. But oh, the perverseness! Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) not bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) nauseousness
on thee?''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>Denys sighed and shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``On thee that art as ripe for folly
as herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys confessed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) young friend had harped his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) very thought. `Twas
passing strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) that a damsel with eyes in her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) head should pass
by a man, and bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) affections on a boy. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not but
recognize in this the bounty of Nature. Boys were human beings after
all, and but for this occasional caprice of women, their lot would be
too terrible; they would be out of the sun altogether, blighted, and
never come to anything; since only the fair could make a man out of
such unpromising materials as a boy. Gerard interrupted this flattering
discourse to beg the warrior-philosopher's acceptance of the lady's
ring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) refused it flatly, and insisted on Gerard going back to the
<div class="bookquote">``Tete d’Or''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>at once, ring and all, like a man, and not letting a poor
girl hold out her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in vain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hands, you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hand, with the `Tete d’Or' in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Failing in this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was for putting the ring on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend's finger.
Gerard declined. <div class="bookquote">``I wear a ring already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, that sorry gimcrack? why, `tis pewter, or tin at best: and this
virgin gold, forbye the jewel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but `twas Margaret gave me this one; and I value it above rubies.
I'll neither part with it nor give it a rival,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) kissed the base
metal, and bade it fear nought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see the owl hath sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ring to a goose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys sorrowfully.
However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) prevailed on Gerard to fasten it inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bonnet. To this,
indeed, the lad consented very readily. For sovereign qualities were
universally ascribed to certain jewels; and the amethyst ranked high
among these precious talismans.

<p/>When this was disposed of, Gerard earnestly requested his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friend to let
the matter drop, since speaking of the other sex to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pine
so for Margaret, and almost unmanned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with the thought that each step
was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) farther from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am no general lover, Denys. There is
room in my heart for one sweetheart, and for one friend. I am far from
my dear mistress; and my friend, a few leagues more, and I must lose him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
too. Oh, let me drink thy friendship pure while I may, and not dilute
with any of these stupid females.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And shalt, honey-pot, and shalt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys kindly'. <div class="bookquote">``But as to
my leaving thee at Remiremont, reckon thou not on that! For''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-three
consecutive oaths-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``if I do. Nay, I shall propose to thee to stay
forty-eight hours there, while I kiss my mother and sisters, and the
females generally, and on go you and I together to the sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Denys! Denys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Denys nor me! `Tis settled. Gainsay me not! or I'll go with thee
to Rome. Why not? his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) Holiness the Pope hath ever some little merry
pleasant war toward, and a Burgundian soldier is still welcome in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
ranks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>On this Gerard opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart. ``Denys, ere I fell in with thee, I used
often to halt on the road, unable to go farther: my puny heart so pulled
me back: and then, after a short prayer to the saints for aid, would I
rise and drag my most unwilling body onward. But since I joined company
with thee, great is my courage. I have found the saying of the
ancients true, that better is a bright comrade on the weary road than
a horse-litter; and, dear brother, when I do think of what we have done
and suffered together! Savedst my life from the bear, and from yet
more savage thieves; and even poor I did make shift to draw thee out
of Rhine, and somehow loved thee double from that hour. How many ties
tender and strong between us! Had I my will, I'd never, never, never,
never part with my Denys on this side the grave. Well-a-day! God His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
will be done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my will shall be done this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>shouted Denys. <div class="bookquote">``Le bon Dieu has
bigger fish to fry than you or me. I'll go with thee to Rome. There is
my hand on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think what, you say! `Tis impossible. `Tis too selfish of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell thee, `tis settled. No power can change me. At Remiremont I
borrow ten pieces of my uncle, and on we go; `tis fixed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They shook hands over it. Then Gerard said nothing, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart was
too full; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ran twice round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) companion as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) walked, then danced
backwards in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and finally took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand, and so on they
went hand in hand like sweethearts, till a company of mounted soldiers,
about fifty in number, rose to sight on the brow of a hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See the banner of Burgundy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys joyfully; <div class="bookquote">``I shall look out for
a comrade among these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How gorgeous is the standard in the sun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard <div class="bookquote">``and how brave
are the leaders with velvet and feathers, and steel breastplates like
glassy mirrors!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>When they came near enough to distinguish faces, Denys uttered an
exclamation: <div class="bookquote">``Why, `tis the Bastard of Burgundy, as I live. Nay, then;
there is fighting a-foot since he (<font color='blue'><b>Bastard</b></font>) is out; a gallant leader, Gerard,
rates his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) life no higher than a private soldier's, and a soldier's no
higher than a tomtit's; and that is the captain for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And see, Denys, the very mules with their great brass frontlets and
trappings seem proud to carry them; no wonder men itch to be soldiers;''
 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>and in the midst of this innocent admiration the troop came up with
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halt!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a stentorian voice. The troop halted. The Bastard of
Burgundy bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Bastard</b></font>) brow gloomily on Denys: <div class="bookquote">``How now, arbalestrier, how
comes it thy face is turned southward, when every good hand and heart is
hurrying northward?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys replied respectfully that he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was going on leave, after some years
of service, to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) kindred at Remiremont.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. But this is not the time for't; the duchy is disturbed. Ho! bring
that dead soldier's mule to the front; and thou mount her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) and forward
with us to Flanders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So please your highness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys firmly, ``that may not be. My home
is close at hand. I have not seen it these three years; and above all, I
have this poor youth in charge, whom I may not, cannot leave, till I see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Flanders</b></font>) shipped for Rome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dost bandy words with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div>said the chief, with amazement, turning fast
to wrath. <div class="bookquote">``Art weary o' thy life? Let go the youth's hand, and into the
saddle without more idle words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys made no reply; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) held Gerard's hand the tighter, and looked
defiance.

<p/>At this the bastard roared, <div class="bookquote">``Jarnac, dismount six of thy archers, and
shoot me this white-livered cur dead where he (<font color='blue'><b>Flanders</b></font>) stands--for an example.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this the bastard</b></font>)</div><p/>The young Count de Jarnac, second in command, gave the order, and the
men dismounted to execute it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strip him (<font color='blue'><b>Flanders</b></font>) naked,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bastard</b></font>)</div>said the bastard, in the cold tone of military
business, <div class="bookquote">``and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Flanders</b></font>) arms and accoutrements on the spare mule We'll
maybe find some clown worthier to wear them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bastard</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys groaned aloud, <div class="bookquote">``Am I to be shamed as well as slain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nay! nay! nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, awaking from the stupor into which
this thunderbolt of tyranny had thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Flanders</b></font>) shall go with you on the
instant. I'd liever part with him (<font color='blue'><b>Flanders</b></font>) for ever than see a hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>Flanders</b></font>) dear
head harmed Oh, sir, oh, my lord, give a poor boy but a minute to bid
his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) only friend farewell! he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) will go with you. I swear he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) shall go with
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The leader</b></font>)</div><p/>The stern leader nodded a cold contemptuous assent. <div class="bookquote">``Thou, Jarnac, stay
with them, and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) on alive or dead. Forward!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>)
march, followed by all the band but the young count and six archers, one
of whom held the spare mule.

<p/>Denys and Gerard gazed at one another haggardly. Oh, what a look!

<p/>And after this mute interchange of anguish, they spoke hurriedly, for
the moments were flying by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou goest to Holland: thou knowest where she (<font color='blue'><b>thou</b></font>) bides. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>thou</b></font>) all. She (<font color='blue'><b>thou</b></font>)
will be kind to thee for my sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sorry tale that I shall carry her (<font color='blue'><b>thou</b></font>)! For God's sake, go back to the
`Tete d’Or.' I am mad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Let me think: have I nought to say to thee, Denys? my head! my
head!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I have it. Make for the Rhine, Gerard! Strasbourg. `Tis but a step.
And down the current to Rotterdam. Margaret is there: I go thither. I'll
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thou art coming. We shall all be together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lads, haste ye, or you will get us into trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the count
firmly, but not harshly now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, one moment! one little moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>panted Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cursed be the land I `was born in! cursed be the race of man! and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
that made them what they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>screamed Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, Denys, hush! blaspheme not! Oh, God forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wots not what
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) says. Be patient, Denys, be patient: though we meet no more on earth,
let us meet in a better world, where no blasphemer may enter. To my
heart, lost friend; for what are words now?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) arms, and
they locked one another in a close embrace. They kissed one another
again and again, speechless, and the tears rained down their cheeks And
the Count Jarnac looked on amazed, but the rougher soldiers, to whom
comrade was a sacred name, looked on with some pity in their hard
faces. Then at a signal from Jarnac, with kind force and words of rude
consolation, they almost lifted Denys on to the mule; and putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
in the middle of them, spurred after their leader. And Gerard ran wildly
after -LRB-for the lane turned-RRB-, to see the very last of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); and the last
glimpse he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) caught, Denys was rocking to and fro on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mule, and tearing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hair out. But at this sight something rose in Gerard's throat so
high, so high, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could run no more nor breathe, but gasped, and leaned
against the snow-clad hedge, seizing it, and choking piteously.

<p/>The thorns ran into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand.

<p/>After a bitter struggle he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) breath again; and now began to see
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own misfortune. Yet not all at once to realize it, so sudden and
numbing was the stroke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) staggered on, but scarce feeling or caring
whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was going; and every now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stopped, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arms
fell and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head sank on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) chest, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stood motionless: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Can this thing be? this must be a dream. `Tis scarce
five minutes since we were so happy, walking handed, faring to Rome
together, and we admired them and their gay banners and helmets oh
hearts of hell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>All nature seemed to stare now as lonely as himself. Not a creature in
sight. No colour but white. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), the ghost of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) former self, wandered
alone among the ghosts of trees, and fields, and hedges. Desolate!
desolate! desolate! All was desolate.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knelt and gathered a little snow. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, I dream not; for this is
snow: cold as the world's heart. It is bloody, too: what may that
mean? Fool! `tis from thy hand. I mind not the wound Ay, I see: thorns.
Welcome! kindly foes: I felt ye not, ye ran not into my heart. Ye are
not cruel like men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had risen, and was dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) leaden limbs along, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard
horses' feet and gay voices behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned with a joyful but wild
hope that the soldiers had relented and were bringing Denys back. But
no, it was a gay cavalcade. A gentleman of rank and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) favourites in
velvet and furs and feathers; and four or five armed retainers in buff
jerkins.

<p/>They swept gaily by.

<p/>Gerard never looked at them after they were gone by: certain gay shadows
had come and passed; that was all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was like one in a dream. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
was rudely wakened; suddenly a voice in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried harshly,
<div class="bookquote">``Stand and deliver!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and there were three of the gentleman's servants in
front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). They had ridden back to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How, ye false knaves,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), quite calmly; <div class="bookquote">``would ye shame your
noble master? He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will hang ye to the nearest tree;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and with these words
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sword doggedly, and set his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) back to the hedge.

<p/>One of the men instantly levelled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) petronel at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>But another, less sanguinary, interposed. <div class="bookquote">``Be not so hasty! And be not
thou so mad! Look yonder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard looked, and scarce a hundred yards off the nobleman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
friends had halted, and sat on their horses, looking at the lawless
act, too proud to do their own dirty work, but not too proud to reap
the fruit, and watch lest their agents should rob them of another man's
money.

<p/>The milder servant then, a good-natured fellow, showed Gerard resistance
was vain; reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) common thieves often took the life as well as the
purse, and assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) it cost a mint to be a gentleman; his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) master had
lost money at play overnight, and was going to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) leman, and so
must take money where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saw it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Therefore, good youth, consider that we rob not for ourselves, and
deliver us that fat purse at thy girdle without more ado, nor put us to
the pain of slitting thy throat and taking it all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This knave is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard calmly aloud but to himself. <div class="bookquote">``I
ought not to fling away my life; Margaret would be so sorry. Take then
the poor man's purse to the rich man's pouch; and with it this; tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I pray the Holy Trinity each coin in it may burn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and
freeze his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart, and blast his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul for ever. Begone and leave me to my
sorrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) flung them the purse.

<p/>They rode away muttering; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) words pricked them a little; a very
little: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) staggered on, penniless now as well as friendless, till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came to the edge of a wood. Then, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart could hardly feel
this second blow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) judgment did; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) began to ask himself what was
the use going further? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat down on the hard road, and ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nails
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hair, and tried to think for the best; a task all the more
difficult that a strange drowsiness was stealing over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Rome he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could
never reach without money. Denys had said, <div class="bookquote">``Go to Strasbourg, and down
the Rhine home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) would obey Denys. But how to get to Strasbourg
without money?

<p/>Then suddenly seemed to ring in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) ears--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gyf the world prove harsh and cold,
Come back to the hedde of gold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I do I must go as her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) servant; I who am Margaret's. I am
a-weary, a-weary. I will sleep, and dream all is as it was. Ah me, how
happy were we an hour agone, we little knew how happy. There is a house:
the owner well-to-do. What if I told him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) my wrong, and prayed his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) aid
to retrieve my purse, and so to Rhine? Fool! is he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) not a man, like the
rest? He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) would scorn me and trample me lower. Denys cursed the race of
men. That will I never; but oh, I begin to loathe and dread them. Nay,
here will I lie till sunset: then darkling creep into this rich man's
barn, and take by stealth a draught of milk or a handful o' grain, to
keep body and soul together. God, who hath seen the rich rob me, will
peradventure forgive me. They say `tis ill sleeping on the snow. Death
steals on such sleepers with muffled feet and honey breath. But what can
I? I am a-weary, a-weary. Shall this be the wood where lie the wolves
yon old man spoke of? I must e'en trust them: they are not men; and I am
so a-weary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) crawled to the roadside, and stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) limbs on the snow,
with a deep sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, tear not thine hair so! teareth my heart to see thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret. Never see me more. Poor Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And the too tender heart was still.

<p/>And the constant lover, and friend of antique mould, lay silent on the
snow; in peril from the weather, in peril from wild beasts, in peril
from hunger, friendless and penniless in a strange land, and not halfway
to Rome.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX

<p/>Rude travel is enticing to us English. And so are its records; even
though the adventurer be no pilgrim of love. And antique friendship has
at least the interest of a fossil. Still, as the true centre of this
story is in Holland, it is full time to return thither, and to those
ordinary personages and incidents whereof life has been mainly composed
in all ages.

<p/>Jorian Ketel came to Peter's house to claim Margaret's promise; but
Margaret was ill in bed, and Peter, on hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) errand, affronted him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
and warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) off the premises, and one or two that stood by were for
ducking him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>); for both father and daughter were favourites, and the
whole story was in every mouth, and Sevenbergens in that state of hot,
undiscriminating irritation which accompanies popular sympathy.

<p/>So Jorian Ketel went off in dudgeon, and repented him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) good deed.
This sort of penitence is not rare, and has the merit of being sincere.
Dierich Brower, who was discovered at <div class="bookquote">``The Three Kings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>making a
chatterbox drunk in order to worm out of him (<font color='blue'><b>chatterbox</b></font>) the whereabouts of Martin
Wittenhaagen, was actually taken and flung into a horsepond, and
threatened with worse usage, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) ever show his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) face in the burgh
again; and finally, municipal jealousy being roused, the burgomaster
of Sevenbergen sent a formal missive to the burgomaster of Tergou,
reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) had overstepped the law, and requesting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) to apply to
the authorities of Sevenbergen on any future occasion when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) might have
a complaint, real or imaginary, against any of its townsfolk.

<p/>The wily Ghysbrecht, suppressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) rage at this remonstrance,
sent back a civil message to say that the person he (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) had followed to
Sevenbergen was a Tergovian, one Gerard, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had stolen the town
records: that Gerard having escaped into foreign parts, and probably
taken the documents with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), the whole matter was at an end.

<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) made a virtue of necessity. But in reality his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) calmness was but
a veil: baffled at Sevenbergen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) views elsewhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
emissaries to learn from the family at Tergou whither Gerard had fled,
and <div class="bookquote">``to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) infinite surprise''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>they did not know. This added to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) uneasiness. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fear Gerard was only lurking in the
neighbourhood: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would make a certain discovery, and would come back
and take a terrible revenge. From this time Dierich and others that were
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dierich</b></font>) noticed a change for the worse in Ghysbrecht Van Swieten. He (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>)
became a moody irritable man. A dread lay on him (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) eyes cast furtive
glances, like one who expects a blow, and knows not from what quarter
it is to come. Making others wretched had not made him (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) happy. It seldom
does.

<p/>The little family at Tergou, which, but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) violent interference,
might in time have cemented its difference without banishing spem gregis
to a distant land, wore still the same outward features, but within was
no longer the simple happy family this tale opened with. Little Kate
knew the share Cornelis and Sybrandt had in banishing Gerard, and
though, for fear of making more mischief still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) never told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
mother, yet there were times she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) shuddered at the bare sight of them,
and blushed at their hypocritical regrets. Catherine, with a woman's
vigilance, noticed this, and with a woman's subtlety said nothing, but
quietly pondered it, and went on watching for more. The black sheep
themselves, in their efforts to partake in the general gloom and sorrow,
succeeded so far as to impose upon their father and Giles: but the
demure satisfaction that lay at their bottom could not escape these
feminine eyes--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That, noting all, seem nought to note.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus mistrust and suspicion sat at the table, poor substitutes for
Gerard's intelligent face, that had brightened the whole circle,
unobserved till it was gone. As for the old hosier his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pride had been
wounded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) son's disobedience, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bore stiffly up, and did
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) best never to mention Gerard's name; but underneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) Spartan
cloak, Nature might be seen tugging at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart-strings. One anxiety he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
never affected to conceal. <div class="bookquote">``If I but knew where the boy is, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
life and health are in no danger, small would be my care,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>would he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) say;
and then a deep sigh would follow. I cannot help thinking that if Gerard
had opened the door just then, and walked in, there would have been many
tears and embraces for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and few reproaches, or none.

<p/>One thing took the old couple quite by surprise--publicity. Ere Gerard
had been gone a week, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) adventures were in every mouth; and to make
matters worse, the popular sympathy declared itself warmly on the side
of the lovers, and against Gerard's cruel parents, and that old busybody
the burgomaster, who must put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nose into a business that nowise
concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, <div class="bookquote">``it is all over the town that Margaret is down with
a fever--a burning fever; her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father fears her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sadly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret? what Margaret?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>inquired Catherine, with a treacherous
assumption of calmness and indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother! whom should I mean? Why, Gerard's Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard's Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>screamed Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``how dare you say such a word
to me? And I rede you never mention that hussy's name in this house,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) has laid bare. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is the ruin of my poor boy, the flower of
all my flock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is the cause that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is not a holy priest in the midst
of us, but is roaming the world, and I a desolate broken-hearted mother.
There, do not cry, my girl, I do ill to speak harsh to you. But oh,
Kate! you know not what passes in a mother's heart. I bear up before
you all; it behoves me swallow my fears; but at night I see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in my
dreams, and still some trouble or other near him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>): sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is torn
by wild beasts; other times he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is in the hands of robbers, and their
cruel knives uplifted to strike his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) poor pale face, that one should
think would move a stone. Oh! when I remember that, while I sit here
in comfort, perhaps my poor boy lies dead in some savage place, and all
along of that girl: there, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) very name is ratsbane to me. I tremble
all over when I hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll not say anything, nor do anything to grieve you worse, mother,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate tenderly; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sighed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) whose name was so fiercely interdicted in this house was much spoken
of, and even pitied elsewhere. All Sevenbergen was sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), and
the young men and maidens cast many a pitying glance, as they passed, at
the little window where the beauty of the village lay <div class="bookquote">``dying for love.''
 (<font color='red'><b>maidens</b></font>)</div>In this familiar phrase they underrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) spirit and unselfishness.
Gerard was not dead, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was too loyal herself to doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
constancy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) father was dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) and helpless; and but for bodily
weakness, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) love for Gerard would not have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) from doing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) duties, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might have gone about them with drooping head and
heavy heart. But physical and mental excitement had brought on an attack
of fever so violent, that nothing but youth and constitution saved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). The malady left her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) at last, but in that terrible state of bodily
weakness in which the patient feels life a burden.

<p/>Then it is that love and friendship by the bedside are mortal angels
with comfort in their voice, and healing in their palms.

<p/>But this poor girl had to come back to life and vigour how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could.
Many days she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay alone, and the heavy hours rolled like leaden waves
over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). In her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) enfeebled state existence seemed a burden, and life a
thing gone by. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not try her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) best to get well. Gerard was gone.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to get well for. Often she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay for hours quite still,
with the tears welling gently out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>One day, waking from an uneasy slumber, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) found two women in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) room,
One was a servant, the other by the deep fur on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) collar and sleeves
was a person of consideration: a narrow band of silvery hair, being
spared by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) coiffure, showed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be past the age when women of
sense concealed their years. The looks of both were kind and friendly.
Margaret tried to raise herself in the bed, but the old lady placed a
hand very gently on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lie still, sweetheart; we come not here to put you about, but to
comfort you, God willing. Now cheer up a bit, and tell us, first, who
think you we are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, madam, I know you, though I never saw you before: you are the
demoiselle Van Eyck, and this is Reicht Heynes. Gerard has oft spoken of
you, and of your goodness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Madam, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) has no friend like you near
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and at this thought she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lay back, and the tears welled out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes in a moment.

<p/>The good-natured Reicht Heynes began to cry for company; but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
mistress scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well, you are a pretty one for a sick-room,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) put out a world of innocent art to cheer the patient; and
not without some little success. An old woman, that has seen life and
all its troubles, is a sovereign blessing by a sorrowful young woman's
side. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knows what to say, and what to avoid. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knows how to soothe
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and interest her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Ere she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been there an hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had Margaret's
head lying on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulder instead of on the pillow, and Margaret's soft
eyes dwelling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with gentle gratitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! this is hair,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, running her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fingers through it.
<div class="bookquote">``Come and look at it, Reicht!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Reicht came and handled it, and praised it unaffectedly. The poor
girl that owned it was not quite out of the reach of flattery; owing
doubtless to not being dead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In sooth, madam, I did use to think it hideous; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) praised it, and
ever since then I have been almost vain of it, saints forgive me. You
know how foolish those are that love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are greater fools that don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, sharply.

<p/>Margaret opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lovely eyes, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) meaning.

<p/>This was only the first of many visits. In fact either Margaret Van Eyck
or Reicht came nearly every day until their patient was convalescent;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) improved rapidly under their hands. Reicht attributed this
principally to certain nourishing dishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) prepared in Peter's
kitchen; but Margaret herself thought more of the kind words and eyes
that kept telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had friends to live for.


<p/>Martin Wittenhaagen went straight to Rotterdam, to take the bull by the
horns. The bull was a biped, with a crown for horns. It was Philip
the Good, duke of this, earl of that, lord of the other. Arrived at
Rotterdam, Martin found the court was at Ghent. To Ghent he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) went, and
sought an audience, but was put off and baffled by lackeys and pages. So
he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) threw himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sovereign's way out hunting, and contrary to
all court precedents, commenced the conversation--by roaring lustily for
mercy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, where is the peril, man?''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>said the duke, looking all round and
laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grace for an old soldier hunted down by burghers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>kings</b></font>)</div><p/>Now kings differ in character like other folk; but there is one trait
they have in common; they are mightily inclined to be affable to men
of very low estate. These do not vie with them in anything whatever,
so jealousy cannot creep in; and they amuse them by their bluntness and
novelty, and refresh the poor things with a touch of nature--a rarity in
courts. So Philip the Good reined in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) horse and gave Martin almost a
tete-a-tete, and Martin reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) of a certain battlefield where he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
had received an arrow intended for his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sovereign. The duke remembered
the incident perfectly, and was graciously pleased to take a cheerful
view of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could afford to, not having been the one hit. Then
Martin told his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) majesty of Gerard's first capture in the church, his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
imprisonment in the tower, and the manoeuvre by which they got him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) out,
and all the details of the hunt; and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) told it better than
I have, or the duke had not heard so many good stories as you have,
certain it is that sovereign got so wrapt up in it, that, when a number
of courtiers came galloping up and interrupted Martin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) swore like
a costermonger, and threatened, only half in jest, to cut off the next
head that should come between him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) and a good story; and when Martin had
done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) cried out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``St. Luke! what sport goeth on in this mine earldom, ay! in my own
woods, and I see it not. You base fellows have all the luck.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
was indignant at the partiality of Fortune. <div class="bookquote">``Lo you now! this was a
man-hunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I never had the luck to be at a man-hunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My luck was none so great,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>replied Martin bluntly: <div class="bookquote">``I was on the wrong
side of the dogs' noses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! so you were; I forgot that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And royalty was more reconciled to its
lot. <div class="bookquote">``What would you then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A free pardon, your highness, for myself and Gerard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For prison-breaking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to; the bird will fly from the cage. `Tis instinct. Besides, coop a
young man up for loving a young woman? These burgomasters must be void
of common sense. What else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For striking down the burgomaster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the hunted boar will turn to bay. `Tis his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right; and I hold him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
less than man that grudges it him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). What else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For killing of the bloodhounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div><p/>The duke's countenance fell.

<p/>```Twas their life or mine,'' said Martin eagerly.

<p/>``Ay! but I can't have, my bloodhounds, my beautiful bloodhounds,
sacrificed to--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no! They were not your dogs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose dogs, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The ranger's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh. Well, I am very sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>ranger</b></font>), but as I was saying I can't have
my old soldiers sacrificed to his (<font color='blue'><b>ranger</b></font>) bloodhounds. Thou shalt have thy free
pardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And poor Gerard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And poor Gerard too, for thy sake. And more, tell thou this burgomaster
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) doings mislike me: this is to set up for a king, not a burgomaster.
I'll have no kings in Holland but one. Bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) be more humble; or by St.
Jude I'll hang him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) before his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own door, as I hanged the burgomaster
of what's the name, some town or other in Flanders it was; no, `twas'
somewhere in Brabant--no matter--I hanged him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), I remember that much--for
oppressing poor folk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div><p/>The duke then beckoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) chancellor, a pursy old fellow that rode like
a sack, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) write out a free pardon for Martin and one Gerard.

<p/>This precious document was drawn up in form, and signed next day, and
Martin hastened home with it.

<p/>Margaret had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bed some days, and was sitting pale and pensive
by the fireside, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) burst in, waving the parchment, and crying, <div class="bookquote">``A
free pardon, girl, for Gerard as well as me! Send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) back when you
will; all the burgomasters on earth daren't lay a finger on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) flushed all over with joy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands trembled with eagerness
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took the parchment and devoured it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes, and kissed it
again and again, and flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms round Martin's neck, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was calmer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) Heaven had raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) up a friend in
the dame Van Eyck. <div class="bookquote">``And I would fain consult her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on this good news; but
I have not strength to walk so far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What need to walk? There is my mule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mule, Martin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The soldier pillager</b></font>)</div><p/>The old soldier or professional pillager laughed, and confessed he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
had got so used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) forgot at times Ghysbrecht had a prior
claim. To-morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) would turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) into the burgomaster's yard, but
to-night she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) should carry Margaret to Tergou.

<p/>It was nearly dusk; so Margaret ventured, and about seven in the evening
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) astonished and gladdened her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) new but ardent friend, by arriving at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) house with unwonted roses on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cheeks, and Gerard's pardon in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
bosom.



<p/>CHAPTER XL

<p/>Some are old in heart at forty, some are young at eighty. Margaret
Van Eyck's heart was an evergreen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) young namesake with
youthful ardour. Nor was this new sentiment a mere caprice; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) was
quick at reading character, and saw in Margaret Brandt that which in
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) own sex goes far with an intelligent woman; genuineness. But,
besides her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) own sterling qualities, Margaret had from the first a potent
ally in the old artist's bosom.

<p/>Human nature.

<p/>Strange as it may appear to the unobservant, our hearts warm more
readily to those we have benefited than to our benefactors. Some of the
Greek philosophers noticed this; but the British Homer has stamped it in
immortal lines:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard, and thought how side by side
We two had stemmed the battle's tide
In many a well-debated field,
Where Bertram's breast was Philip's shield.
I thought on Darien's deserts pale,
Where Death bestrides the evening gale,
How o’er my friend my cloak I threw,
And fenceless faced the deadly dew.
I thought on Quariana's cliff,
Where, rescued from our foundering skiff,
Through the white breakers' wrath I bore
Exhausted Bertram to the shore:
And when his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) side an arrow found,
I sucked the Indian's venom'd wound.
These thoughts like torrents rushed along
To sweep away my purpose strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Homer</b></font>)</div><p/>Observe! this assassin's hand is stayed by memory, not of benefits
received, but benefits conferred.

<p/>Now Margaret Van Eyck had been wonderfully kind to Margaret Brandt; had
broken through her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) own habits to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>); had nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>), and
soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>), and petted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>), and cured her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) more than all the medicine in
the world. So her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) heart opened to the recipient of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) goodness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>)
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) now far more tenderly than she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) had ever loved Gerard, though,
in truth, it was purely out of regard for Gerard she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) had visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) in
the first instance.

<p/>When, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) saw the roses on Margaret's cheek, and read the
bit of parchment that had brought them there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own views
without a murmur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sweetheart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I did desire he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) should stay in Italy five
or six years, and come back rich, and above all, an artist. But your
happiness is before all, and I see you cannot live without him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>), so we
must have him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) home as fast as may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, madam! you see my very thoughts.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>And the young woman hung her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head
a moment and blushed. <div class="bookquote">``But how to let him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) know, madam? That passes my
skill. He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) is gone to Italy; but what part I know not. Stay! he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) named the
cities he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) should visit. Florence was one, and Rome.''  (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>But then--Finally,
being a sensible girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) divined that a letter, addressed, <div class="bookquote">``My
Gerard--Italy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>might chance to miscarry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked imploringly at
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friend for counsel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are come to the right place, and at the right time,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old
lady. <div class="bookquote">``Here was this Hans Memling with me to-day; he (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) is going to Italy,
girl, no later than next week, `to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) hand,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) says. Not
before `twas needed, I do assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how is he (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) to find my Gerard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knows your Gerard, child. They have supped here more than
once, and were like hand and glove. Now, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) business is the same as
Gerard's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will visit the same places as Gerard, and soon or late he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
must fall in with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Wherefore, get you a long letter written, and
copy out this pardon into it, and I'll answer for the messenger. In six
months at farthest Gerard shall get it; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shall get it, then
will he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) kiss it, and put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bosom, and come flying home. What are
you smiling at? And now what makes your cheeks so red? And what you
are smothering me for, I cannot think. Yes! happy days are coming to my
little pearl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>Meantime, Martin sat in the kitchen, with the black-jack before him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) and
Reicht Heynes spinning beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>): and, wow! but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pumped him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) that
night.


<p/>This Hans Memling was an old pupil of Jan Van Eyck and his (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>)
was a painter notwithstanding Margaret's sneer, and a good soul enough,
with one fault. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) loved the <div class="bookquote">``nipperkin, canakin, and the brown bowl''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>more than they deserve. This singular penchant kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) from amassing
fortune, and was the cause that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) often came to Margaret Van Eyck for
a meal, and sometimes for a groat. But this gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) a claim on him (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) would not trifle with any commission she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) should entrust to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>).

<p/>The letter was duly written and left with Margaret Van Eyck; and the
following week, sure enough, Hans Memling returned from Flanders,
Margaret Van Eyck gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) the letter, and a piece of gold towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>)
travelling expenses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) seemed in a hurry to be off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>the artist</b></font>)</div>said the old artist; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will be the sooner in Italy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the artist</b></font>)</div><p/>But as there are horses who burn and rage to start, and after the first
yard or two want the whip, so all this hurry cooled into inaction when
Hans got as far as the principal hostelry of Tergou, and saw two of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) boon companions sitting in the bay window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) went in for a parting
glass with them; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) offered to pay, they would not hear of it,
No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was going a long journey; they would treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>); everybody must
treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>), the landlord and all.

<p/>It resulted from this treatment that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) tongue got as loose as if the
wine had been oil; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) confided to the convivial crew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was
going to show the Italians how to paint: next he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) sang his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) exploits
in battle, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had handled a pike; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) amorous successes with
females, not present to oppose their version of the incidents. In short,
<div class="bookquote">``plenus rimarum erat: huc illuc diffluebat;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and among the miscellaneous
matters that oozed out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) must blab that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was entrusted with a letter
to a townsman of theirs, one Gerard, a good fellow: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added <div class="bookquote">``you are
all good fellows:''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and to impress his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eulogy, slapped Sybrandt on the
back so heartily, as to drive the breath out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) body.

<p/>Sybrandt got round the table to avoid this muscular approval; but
listened to every word, and learned for the first time that Gerard was
gone to Italy. However, to make sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) affected to doubt it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother Gerard is never in Italy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye lie, ye cur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Hans Cloterman/Cloterman</b></font>)</div>roared Hans, taking instantly the irascible turn, and
not being clear enough to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>), who now sat opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>), was the
same he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had praised, and hit, when beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is ten times
your brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is in Italy. What call ye this? There, read me that
superscription!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) flung down a letter on the table.

<p/>Sybrandt took it up, and examined it gravely; but eventually laid it
down, with the remark, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) could not read. However, one of the
company, by some immense fortuity, could read; and proud of so rare an
accomplishment, took it, and read it out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Gerard Eliassoen, of Tergou. These by the hand of the trusty Hans
Memling, with all speed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis excellently well writ,'' said the reader, examining every letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Hans Cloterman/Cloterman</b></font>)</div>said Hans bombastically, <div class="bookquote">``and small wonder: `tis writ by a famous
hand; by Margaret, sister of Jan Van Eyck. Blessed and honoured be his (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>)
memory! She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is an old friend of mine, is Margaret Van Eyck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Hans Cloterman/Cloterman</b></font>)</div><p/>Miscellaneous Hans then diverged into forty topics.

<p/>Sybrandt stole out of the company, and went in search of Cornelis.

<p/>They put their heads together over the news: Italy was an immense
distance off. If they could only keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) there?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) there? Nothing would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) long from his (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Curse her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>said Sybrandt. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) die when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) die? She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would outlive the pest to vex us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cornelis</b></font>)</div>And Cornelis was wroth
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>) selfishness in not dying, to oblige.

<p/>These two black sheep kept putting their heads together, and tainting
each other worse and worse, till at last their corrupt hearts conceived
a plan for keeping Gerard in Italy all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) life, and so securing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
share of their father's substance.

<p/>But when they had planned it they were no nearer the execution: for that
required talent: so iniquity came to a standstill. But presently, as if
Satan had come between the two heads, and whispered into the right ear
of one and the left of the other simultaneously, they both burst out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THE BURGOMASTER!''


 (<font color='red'><b>Satan</b></font>)</div><p/>They went to Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) received them at once:
for the man who is under the torture of suspense catches eagerly at
knowledge. Certainty is often painful, but seldom, like suspense,
intolerable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have news of Gerard?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eagerly.

<p/>Then they told about the letter and Hans Memling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) listened with
restless eye. <div class="bookquote">``Who writ the letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret Van Eyck,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply; for they naturally thought the
contents were by the same hand as the superscription.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are ye sure?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) went to a drawer and drew out a paper written by
Margaret Van Eyck while treating with the burgh for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) house. <div class="bookquote">``Was it
writ like this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. `Tis the same writing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>said Sybrandt boldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. And now what would ye of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>said Ghysbrecht, with beating
heart, but a carelessness so well feigned that it staggered them. They
fumbled with their bonnets, and stammered and spoke a word or two, then
hesitated and beat about the bush, and let out by degrees that they
wanted a letter written, to say something that might keep Gerard in
Italy; and this letter they proposed to substitute in Hans Memling's
wallet for the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) carried. While these fumbled with their bonnets
and their iniquity, and vacillated between respect for a burgomaster,
and suspicion that this one was as great a rogue as themselves, and
somehow or other, on their side against Gerard, pros and cons were
coursing one another to and fro in the keen old man's spirit. Vengeance
said let Gerard come back and feel the weight of the law. Prudence said
keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a thousand miles off. But then Prudence said also, why do dirty
work on a doubtful chance? Why put it in the power of these two rogues
to tarnish your name? Finally, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) strong persuasion that Gerard was
in possession of a secret by means of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could wound him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to the
quick, coupled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) caution, found words thus: <div class="bookquote">``It is my duty to
aid the citizens that cannot write. But for their matter I will not be
responsible. Tell me, then, what I shall write.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something about this Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay! that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is false, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is married to another, I'll go
bail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, burgomaster, nay! not for all the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>cried Sybrandt; <div class="bookquote">``Gerard
would not believe it, or but half, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would come back to see.
No; say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead! what, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) age, will he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) credit that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sooner than the other. Why she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was nearly dead: so it is not to say a
downright lie, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! And you think that will keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in Italy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are sure of it, are we not, Cornelis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cornelis</b></font>)</div>said Cornelis, <div class="bookquote">``our Gerard will never leave Italy now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is
there. It was always his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dream to get there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would come back for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) Margaret, but not for us. What cares he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) for us? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) despises his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own
family; always did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cornelis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This would be a bitter pill to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the hypocrite</b></font>)</div>said the old hypocrite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) good in the end,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the young one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What avails Famine wedding Thirst?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cornelis</b></font>)</div>said Cornelis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the grief you are preparing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) so coolly?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ghysbrecht spoke
sarcastically, but tasted his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) own vengeance all the time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a lie is not like a blow with a curtal axe. It hacks no flesh, and
breaks no bones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A curtal axe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>said Sybrandt; <div class="bookquote">``no, nor even like a stroke with a
cudgel.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) shot a sly envenomed glance at the burgomaster's broken
nose.

<p/>Ghysbrecht's face darkened with ire when this adder's tongue struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>)
wound. But it told, as intended: the old man bristled with hate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``tell me what to write for you, and I must write it;
but take notice, you bear the blame if aught turns amiss. Not the hand
which writes, but the tongue which dictates, doth the deed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The brothers assented warmly, sneering within. Ghysbrecht then drew
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) inkhorn towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>), and laid the specimen of Margaret Van Eyck's
writing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>), and made some inquiries as to the size and shape
of the letter, when an unlooked-for interruption occurred; Jorian Ketel
burst hastily into the room, and looked vexed at not finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou seest I have matter on hand, good fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay; but this is grave. I bring good news; but `tis not for every ear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The burgomaster</b></font>)</div><p/>The burgomaster rose, and drew Jorian aside into the embrasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>)
deep window, and then the brothers heard them converse in low but eager
tones. It ended by Ghysbrecht sending Jorian out to saddle his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) mule. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>)
then addressed the black sheep with a sudden coldness that amazed them--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I prize the peace of households; but this is not a thing to be done in
a hurry: we will see about it, we will see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, burgomaster, the man will be gone. It will be too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the hostelry, drinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drinking! We will see, we will see.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) sent them
off discomfited.

<p/>To explain all this we must retrograde a step. This very morning then,
Margaret Brandt had met Jorian Ketel near her (<font color='blue'><b>burgomaster</b></font>) own door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>burgomaster</b></font>)
with a scowl. This struck her (<font color='blue'><b>burgomaster</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>burgomaster</b></font>) remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>burgomaster</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes! it is the good man who saved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Oh! why
have you not been near me since? And why have you not come for the
parchments? Was it not true about the hundred crowns?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>Jorian gave a snort; but, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>burgomaster</b></font>) face that looked so candid, began
to think there might be some mistake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>burgomaster</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) had come, and how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) had been received.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>burgomaster</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I knew nought of this. I lay at Death's door. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
then invited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the garden and showed
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the spot where the parchments were buried. Martin was for taking
them up, but I would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) put them there; and I said none
should move them but you, who had earned them so well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) and me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me a spade!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>cried Jorian eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``But stay! No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is a
suspicious man. You are sure they are there still?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will openly take the blame if human hand hath touched them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then keep them but two hours more, I prithee, good Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>said
Jorian, and ran off to the Stadthouse of Tergou a joyful man.

<p/>The burgomaster jogged along towards Sevenbergen, with Jorian striding
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assurance that in an hour's time the missing
parchments would be in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, master!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``lucky for us it wasn't a thief that took them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a thief? not a thief? what call you him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, saving your presence, I call him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) a jackdaw. This is jackdaw's
work, if ever there was; `take the thing you are least in need of, and
hide it'--that's a jackdaw. I should know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>added Jorian oracularly,
<div class="bookquote">``for I was brought up along with a chough. He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) and I were born the same
year, but he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) cut his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) teeth long before me, and wow! but my life was a
burden for years all along of him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>). If you had but a hole in your hose no
bigger than a groat, in went his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) beak like a gimlet; and, for stealing,
Gerard all over. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wanted least, and any poor Christian in the
house wanted most, that went first. Mother was a notable woman, so
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) did but look round, away flew her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) thimble. Father lived by
cordwaining, so about sunrise Jack went diligently off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) awl, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
wax, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) twine. After that, make your bread how you could! One day
I heard my mother tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was enough to corrupt
half-a-dozen other children; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) only cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eye at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and next
minute away with the nurseling's shoe off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) very foot. Now this Gerard
is tarred with the same stick. The parchments are no more use to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
than a thimble or an awl to Jack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) took `em out of pure mischief and
hid them, and you would never have found them but for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>said Ghysbrecht, <div class="bookquote">``and I have vexed myself
more than need.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>When they came to Peter's gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) felt uneasy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it had been anywhere but here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>Jorian reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The girl is honest and friendly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had nothing to do with
taking them, I'll be sworn;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) into the garden. <div class="bookquote">``There,
master, if a face is to be believed, here they lie; and see, the mould
is loose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) ran for a spade which was stuck up in the ground at some distance,
and soon went to work and uncovered a parchment. Ghysbrecht saw it, and
thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) aside and went down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) knees and tore it out of the hole.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) hands trembled and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) face shone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) threw out parchment after
parchment, and Jorian dusted them and cleared them and shook them. Now,
when Ghysbrecht had thrown out a great many, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) face began to darken
and lengthen, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) came to the last, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) hands to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>)
temples and seemed to be all amazed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What mystery lies here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Are fiends mocking me? Dig deeper!
There must be another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>Jorian drove the spade in and threw out quantities of hard mould. In
vain. And even while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) dug, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) master's mood had changed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Treason! treachery!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You knew of this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Knew what, master, in Heaven's name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Caitiff, you knew there was another one worth all these twice told.'

<p/>```Tis false,<div class="bookquote">'' cried Jorian, made suspicious by the other's suspicion.
```Tis a trick to rob me of my hundred crowns. Oh! I know you,
burgomaster.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>And Jorian was ready to whimper.

<p/>A mellow voice fell on them both like oil upon the waves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, good man, it is not false, nor yet is it quite true: there was
another parchment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, there, there! Where is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>continued Margaret calmly, <div class="bookquote">``it was not a town record -LRB-so you have
gained your hundred crowns, good man-RRB-: it was but a private deed between
the burgomaster here and my grandfather Flor--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--is Brandt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is it, girl? that is all we want to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have patience, and I shall tell you. Gerard read the title of it, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said, `This is as much yours as the burgomaster's,' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) put it
apart, to read it with me at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) leisure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is in the house, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>the burgomaster</b></font>)</div>said the burgomaster, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>)
calmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret gravely, <div class="bookquote">``it is not.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>Then, in a voice
that faltered suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``You hunted--my poor Gerard--so hard--and so
close-that you gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)--no time-to think of aught--but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) life--and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) grief. The parchment was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bosom, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hath ta’en it with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whither, whither?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask me no more, sir. What right is yours to question me thus? It was
for your sake, good man, I put force upon my heart, and came out here,
and bore to speak at all to this hard old man. For, when I think of the
misery he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has brought on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and me, the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is more than I can
bear;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gave an involuntary shudder, and went slowly in, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head, crying bitterly.

<p/>Remorse for the past, and dread of the future--the slow, but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) now
felt, the inevitable future--avarice, and fear, all tugged in one short
moment at Ghysbrecht's tough heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) arms fell
listless by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) sides. A coarse chuckle made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) start round, and there
stood Martin Wittenhaagen leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) bow, and sneering from ear
to ear. At sight of the man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grinning face, Ghysbrecht's worst
passions awoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho! attach him (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>), seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>), traitor and thief!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Dog, thou
shalt pay for all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin, without a word, calmly thrust the duke's pardon under
Ghysbrecht's nose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) looked, and had not a word to say. Martin followed
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) advantage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The duke and I are soldiers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) won't let you greasy burghers trample
on an old comrade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) bade me carry you a message too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The duke send a message to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) of your masterful doings, of your imprisoning Gerard
for loving a girl; and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), `Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) this is to be a king, not
a burgomaster. I'll have no kings in Holland but one. Bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) be more
humble, or I'll hang him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own door,'''

<p/>-LRB-Ghysbrecht trembled: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought the duke capable of the deed-RRB-

<p/>```as I hanged the burgomaster of Thingembob.' The duke could not mind
which of you he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had hung, or in what part; such trifles stick not in a
soldier's memory; but he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had hanged one of you for grinding
poor folk, `and I'm the man to hang another,' quoth the good duke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>These repeated insults from so mean a man, coupled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
invulnerability, shielded as he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was by the duke, drove the choleric old
man into a fit of impotent fury: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist at the soldier,
and tried to threaten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but could not speak for the rage and
mortification that choked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave a sort of screech, and
coiled himself up in eye and form like a rattlesnake about to strike;
and spat furiously upon Martin's doublet.

<p/>The thick-skinned soldier treated this ebullition with genuine contempt.
<div class="bookquote">``Here's a venomous old toad! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows a kick from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foot would send
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last home; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants me to cheat the gallows. But I have
slain too many men in fair fight to lift limb against anything less than
a man; and this I count no man. What is it, in Heaven's name? an old
goat's-skin bag full o' rotten bones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mule! my mule!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>screamed Ghysbrecht.

<p/>Jorian helped the old man up trembling in every joint. Once in the
saddle, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to gather in a moment unnatural vigour; and the figure
that went flying to Tergou was truly weird-like and terrible: so old and
wizened the face; so white and reverend the streaming hair; so baleful
the eye; so fierce the fury which shook the bent frame that went
spurring like mad; while the quavering voice yelled, <div class="bookquote">``I'll make their
hearts ache. I'll make their hearts ache. I'll make their hearts ache.
I'll make their hearts ache. All of them. All!--all!--all!''


 (<font color='red'><b>Tergou</b></font>)</div><p/>The black sheep sat disconsolate amidst the convivial crew, and eyed
Hans Memling's wallet. For more ease he (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) had taken it off, and flung it
on the table. How readily they could have slipped out that letter and
put in another. For the first time in their lives they were sorry they
had not learned to write, like their brother.

<p/>And now Hans began to talk of going, and the brothers agreed in a
whisper to abandon their project for the time. They had scarcely
resolved this, when Dierich Brower stood suddenly in the doorway, and
gave them a wink.

<p/>They went out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come to the burgomaster with all speed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>),

<p/>They found Ghysbrecht seated at a table, pale and agitated. Before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>)
lay Margaret Van Eyck's handwriting. <div class="bookquote">``I have written what you desired,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now for the superscription. What were the words? did ye see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We cannot read,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cornelis</b></font>)</div>said Cornelis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then is all this labour lost,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Ghysbrecht angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Dolts!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, but,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>said Sybrandt, <div class="bookquote">``I heard the words read, and I have not lost
them. They were, `To Gerard Eliassoen, these by the hand of the trusty
Hans Memling, with all speed.'''

<p/>```Tis well. Now, how was the letter folded? how big was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Longer than that one, and not so long as this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis well. Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>)?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the hostelry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then, take you this groat, and treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>). Then ask to see the
letter, and put this in place of it. Come to me with the other letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The brothers</b></font>)</div><p/>The brothers assented, took the letter, and went to the hostelry.

<p/>They had not been gone a minute, when Dierich Brower issued from the
Stadthouse, and followed them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) orders not to let them out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) sight till the true letter was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) master's hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) watched
outside the hostelry.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) had not long to wait. They came out almost immediately, with downcast
looks. Dierich made up to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too late!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they cried; <div class="bookquote">``too late! He (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) is gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone? How long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scarce five minutes. Cursed chance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must go back to the burgomaster at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dierich/Dierich Brower/Brower</b></font>)</div>said Dierich Brower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To what end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter; come!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brower</b></font>) hurried them to the Stadthouse.

<p/>Ghysbrecht Van Swieten was not the man to accept a defeat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>), on hearing the ill news, <div class="bookquote">``suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) is gone. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>)
mounted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what hinders you to come up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what avails coming up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>)! There are no hostelries on the road
he (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) is gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fools!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>said Ghysbrecht, <div class="bookquote">``is there no way of emptying a man's pockets
but liquor and sleight of hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>A meaning look, that passed between Ghysbrecht and Dierich, aided the
brothers' comprehension. They changed colour, and lost all zeal for the
business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! no! we don't hate our brother. We won't get ourselves hanged to
spite him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>said Sybrandt; <div class="bookquote">``that would be a fool's trick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hanged!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Ghysbrecht. <div class="bookquote">``Am I not the burgomaster? How can ye be
hanged? I see how `tis ye fear to tackle one man, being two: hearts
of hare, that ye are! Oh! why cannot I be young again? I'd do it
single-handed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man now threw off all disguise, and showed them his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart was in
this deed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then flattered and besought, and jeered them alternately,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found no eloquence could move them to an action, however
dishonourable, which was attended with danger. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened a
drawer, and showed them a pile of silver coins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Change but those letters for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and each of you shall
thrust one hand into this drawer, and take away as many of them as you
can hold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The effect was magical. Their eyes glittered with desire. Their whole
bodies seemed to swell, and rise into male energy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Swear it, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>said Sybrandt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I swear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; on the crucifix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>Ghysbrecht swore upon the crucifix.

<p/>The next minute the brothers were on the road, in pursuit of Hans
Memling. They came in sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) about two leagues from Tergou, but
though they knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) had no weapon but his (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) staff, they were too prudent
to venture on him (<font color='blue'><b>Memling</b></font>) in daylight; so they fell back.

<p/>But being now three leagues and more from the town, and on a grassy
road--sun down, moon not yet up--honest Hans suddenly found himself
attacked before and behind at once by men with uplifted knives, who
cried in loud though somewhat shaky voices, <div class="bookquote">``Stand and deliver!''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>The attack was so sudden, and so well planned, that Hans was dismayed.
<div class="bookquote">``Slay me not, good fellows,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``I am but a poor man, and ye
shall have my all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it then. Live! but empty thy wallet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nought in my wallet, good friend, but one letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we shall see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>said Sybrandt, who was the one in front.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is a letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it not from me, I pray you. `Tis worth nought, and the good dame
would fret that writ it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>said Sybrandt, <div class="bookquote">``take back thy letter; and now empty thy pouch.
Come I tarry not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div><p/>But by this time Hans had recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) confusion; and from a certain
flutter in Sybrandt, and hard breathing of Cornelis, aided by an
indescribable consciousness, felt sure the pair he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) had to deal with were
no heroes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) pretended to fumble for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) money: then suddenly thrust
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) staff fiercely into Sybrandt's face, and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) staggering, and
lent Cornelis a back-handed slash on the ear that sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) twirling like
a weathercock in March; then whirled his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) weapon over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) head and danced
about the road like a figure on springs, shouting:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, ye thieving loons! Come on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a plain invitation; yet they misunderstood it so utterly as to
take to their heels, with Hans after them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) shouting <div class="bookquote">``Stop thieves!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and they howling with fear and pain as they ran.



<p/>CHAPTER XLI

<p/>Denys, placed in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) companions, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) should be so mad
as attempt escape was carried off in an agony of grief and remorse. For
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sake Gerard had abandoned the German route to Rome; and what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
reward? left all alone in the centre of Burgundy. This was the thought
which maddened Denys most, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) now rave at heaven and earth,
now fall into a gloomy silence so savage and sinister that it was deemed
prudent to disarm him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). They caught up their leader just outside the
town, and the whole cavalcade drew up and baited at the <div class="bookquote">``Tete d’Or.''

 (<font color='red'><b>leader</b></font>)</div><p/>The young landlady, though much occupied with the count, and still
more with the bastard, caught sight of Denys, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) somewhat
anxiously what had become of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) young companion?

<p/>Denys, with a burst of grief, told her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) all, and prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to send after
Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Now he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is parted from me, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will maybe listen to my rede,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``poor wretch, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) loves not solitude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlady gave a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I trow I have been somewhat
over-kind already,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), and turned rather red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) poured a volley of curses and abuse upon her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) back upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and went off whimpering, and Saying she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
was not used to be cursed at; and ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) hind to saddle two mules.

<p/>Denys went north with his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) troop, mute and drooping over his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) saddle,
and quite unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), that veracious young lady made an equestrian
toilet in only forty minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) being really in a hurry, and spurred
away with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) servant in the opposite direction.

<p/>At dark, after a long march, the bastard and his (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) men reached <div class="bookquote">``The White
Hart;''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>their arrival caused a prodigious bustle, and it was some time
before Manon discovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) old friend among so many. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>)
showed it only by heightened colour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) did not claim the acquaintance.
The poor soul was already beginning to scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The base degrees by which she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) did ascend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys saw but could not smile. The inn reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) too much of Gerard.

<p/>Ere the night closed the wind changed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) looked into the room and
beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) finger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rose sulkily, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) guards with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I would speak a word to thee in private.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to a corner of the room, and there asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) under her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>)
breath would he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) do her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) a kindness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) answered out loud, <div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) would not; he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) was not in the vein to do
kindnesses to man or woman. If he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) did a kindness it should be to a dog;
and not that if he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) could help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, good archer, I did you one eftsoons, you and your pretty
comrade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manon</b></font>)</div>said Manon humbly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did, dame, you did; well then, for his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) sake--what is't to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou knowest my story. I had been unfortunate. Now I am worshipful. But
a woman did cast him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) in my teeth this day. And so `twill be ever while
he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) hangs there. I would have him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) ta’en down; well-a-day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And none dare I ask but thee. Wilt do't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I, even were I not a prisoner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Manon</b></font>)</div><p/>On this stern refusal the tender Manon sighed, and clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) palms
together despondently. Denys told her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) need not fret. There were
soldiers of a lower stamp who would not make two bites of such a cherry.
It was a mere matter of money; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) could find two angels, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) would
find two soldiers to do the dirty work of <div class="bookquote">``The White Hart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>soldiers</b></font>)</div><p/>This was not very palatable. However, reflecting that soldiers were
birds of passage, drinking here to-night, knocked on the head there
to-morrow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) said softly, <div class="bookquote">``Send them out to me. But prithee, tell them
that `tis for one that is my friend; let them not think `tis for me; I
should sink into the earth; times are changed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys found warriors glad to win an angel apiece so easily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sent them
out, and instantly dismissing the subject with contempt, sat brooding on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) lost friend.

<p/>Manon and the warriors soon came to a general understanding. But what
were they to do with the body when taken down? She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``The river
is nigh the--the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fling him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay; be not so cruel! Could ye not put him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--gently--and--with
somewhat weighty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) must have been thinking on the subject in detail; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) was not
one to whom ideas came quickly.

<p/>All was speedily agreed, except the time of payment. The mail-clad
itched for it, and sought it in advance. Manon demurred to that.

<p/>What, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) doubt their word? then let her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) come along with them, or
watch them at a distance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Manon</b></font>)</div>said Manon with horror. <div class="bookquote">``I would liever die than see it done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which yet you would have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, for sore is my need. Times are changed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) had already forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) precept to Denys.

<p/>An hour later the disagreeable relic of caterpillar existence ceased
to canker the worshipful matron's public life, and the grim eyes of the
past to cast malignant glances down into a white hind's clover field.

<p/>Total. She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) made the landlord an average wife, and a prime house-dog, and
outlived everybody.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) troops, when they returned from executing with mediaeval naivete
the precept, <div class="bookquote">``Off wi' the auld love,''  (<font color='red'><b>troops</b></font>)</div>received a shock. They found
the market-place black with groups; it had been empty an hour ago.
Conscience smote them. This came of meddling with the dead. However, the
bolder of the two, encouraged by the darkness, stole forward alone, and
slily mingled with a group: he (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) soon returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) companion, saying,
in a tone of reproach not strictly reasonable,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye born fool, it is only a miracle.''



 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLII

<p/>Letters of fire on the church wall had just inquired, with an appearance
of genuine curiosity, why there was no mass for the duke in this time of
trouble. The supernatural expostulation had been seen by many, and had
gradually faded, leaving the spectators glued there gaping. The upshot
was, that the corporation, not choosing to be behind the angelic powers
in loyalty to a temporal sovereign, invested freely in masses. By this
an old friend of ours, the cure, profited in hard cash; for which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
a very pretty taste. But for this I would not of course have detained
you over so trite an occurrence as a miracle.


<p/>Denys begged for his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">``Why disgrace him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) as well as break his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
heart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then swear on the cross of thy sword not to leave the bastard's service
until the sedition shall be put down.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) yielded to necessity, and
delivered three volleys of oaths, and recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) arms and liberty.

<p/>The troops halted at <div class="bookquote">``The Three Fish,''  (<font color='red'><b>The troops Marion</b></font>)</div>and Marion at sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) cried
out, <div class="bookquote">``I'm out of luck; who would have thought to see you again?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then
seeing he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was sad, and rather hurt than amused at this blunt jest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>)
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) what was amiss? He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) took a bright view of the
case. Gerard was too handsome and well-behaved to come to harm. The
women too would always be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) side. Moreover, it was clear that
things must either go well or ill with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). In the former case he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would
strike in with some good company going to Rome; in the latter he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would
return home, perhaps be there before his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friend; <div class="bookquote">``for you have a trifle
of fighting to do in Flanders by all accounts.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) then brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gold pieces, and steadily refused to accept one, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>)
again and again. Denys was somewhat convinced by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) argument, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) concurred with his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) own wishes, and was also cheered a little by
finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) so honest. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) think a little better of that world
in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) poor little friend was walking alone.

<p/>Foot soldiers in small bodies down to twos and threes were already on
the road, making lazily towards Flanders, many of them penniless, but
passed from town to town by the bailiffs, with orders for food and
lodging on the innkeepers.

<p/>Anthony of Burgundy overtook numbers of these, and gathered them under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) standard, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) entered Flanders at the head of six hundred
men. On crossing the frontier he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) was met by his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) brother Baldwyn, with
men, arms, and provisions; he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) organized his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) whole force and marched on
in battle array through several towns, not only without impediment,
but with great acclamations. This loyalty called forth comments not
altogether gracious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This rebellion of ours is a bite,''  (<font color='red'><b>a soldier</b></font>)</div>growled a soldier called Simon, who
had elected himself Denys's comrade.

<p/>Denys said nothing, but made a little vow to St. Mars to shoot this
Anthony of Burgundy dead, should the rebellion, that had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>)
Gerard, prove no rebellion.

<p/>That afternoon they came in sight of a strongly fortified town; and a
whisper went through the little army that this was a disaffected place.

<p/>But when they came in sight, the great gate stood open, and the towers
that flanked it on each side were manned with a single sentinel
apiece. So the advancing force somewhat broke their array and marched
carelessly.

<p/>When they were within a furlong, the drawbridge across the moat rose
slowly and creaking till it stood vertical against the fort and the
very moment it settled into this warlike attitude, down rattled the
portcullis at the gate, and the towers and curtains bristled with lances
and crossbows.

<p/>A stern hum ran through the bastard's front rank and spread to the rear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halt!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>). The word went down the line, and they halted. <div class="bookquote">``Herald
to the gate!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A pursuivant spurred out of the ranks, and halting twenty
yards from the gate, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) bugle with his (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) herald's flag hanging
down round it, and blew a summons. A tall figure in brazen armour
appeared over the gate. A few fiery words passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) and the
herald, which were not audible, but their import clear, for the herald
blew a single keen and threatening note at the walls, and came galloping
back with war in his (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) face. The bastard moved out of the line to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>), and their heads had not been together two seconds ere he (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) turned in
his (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) saddle and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Pioneers, to the van!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and in a moment hedges
were levelled, and the force took the field and encamped just out of
shot from the walls; and away went mounted officers flying south, east,
and west, to the friendly towns, for catapults, palisades, mantelets,
raw hides, tar-barrels, carpenters, provisions, and all the materials
for a siege.

<p/>The bright perspective mightily cheered one drooping soldier. At
the first clang of the portcullis his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) eyes brightened and his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) temple
flushed; and when the herald came back with battle in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) eye he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) saw it
in a moment, and for the first time this many days cried, <div class="bookquote">``Courage, tout
le monde, le diable est mort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If that great warrior heard, how he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) must have grinned!

<p/>The besiegers encamped a furlong from the walls, and made roads; kept
their pikemen in camp ready for an assault when practicable; and sent
forward their sappers, pioneers, catapultiers, and crossbowmen. These
opened a siege by filling the moat, and mining, or breaching the wall,
etc.. And as much of their work had to be done under close fire of
arrows, quarels, bolts, stones, and little rocks, the above artists <div class="bookquote">``had
need of a hundred eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the artists</b></font>)</div>and acted in concert with a vigilance, and an
amount of individual intelligence, daring, and skill, that made a siege
very interesting, and even amusing: to lookers on.

<p/>The first thing they did was to advance their carpenters behind rolling
mantelets, to erect a stockade high and strong on the very edge of the
moat. Some lives were lost at this, but not many; for a strong force of
crossbowmen, including Denys, rolled their mantelets up and shot over
the workmen's heads at every besieged who showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) nose, and at every
loophole, arrow-slit, or other aperture, which commanded the particular
spot the carpenters happened to be upon. Covered by their condensed
fire, these soon raised a high palisade between them and the ordinary
missiles from the pierced masonry.

<p/>But the besieged expected this, and ran out at night their boards or
wooden penthouses on the top of the curtains. The curtains were built
with square holes near the top to receive the beams that supported these
structures, the true defence of mediaeval forts, from which the besieged
delivered their missiles with far more freedom and variety of range
than they could shoot through the oblique but immovable loopholes of the
curtain, or even through the sloping crenelets of the higher towers.
On this the besiegers brought up mangonels, and set them hurling
huge stones at these woodworks and battering them to pieces.
Contemporaneously they built a triangular wooden tower as high as the
curtain, and kept it ready for use, and just out of shot.

<p/>This was a terrible sight to the besieged. These wooden towers had taken
many a town. They began to mine underneath that part of the moat the
tower stood frowning at; and made other preparations to give it a warm
reception. The besiegers also mined, but at another part, their object
being to get under the square barbican and throw it down. All this time
Denys was behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mantelet with another arbalestrier, protecting the
workmen and making some excellent shots. These ended by earning him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
the esteem of an unseen archer, who every now and then sent a winged
compliment quivering into his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mantelet. One came and struck within an
inch of the narrow slit through which Denys was squinting at the moment.
<div class="bookquote">``Peste,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you shoot well, my friend. Come forth and receive my
congratulations! Shall merit such as thine hide its head? Comrade, it
is one of those cursed Englishmen, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Comrade</b></font>) half ell shaft. I'll not die
till I've had a shot at London wall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On the side of the besieged was a figure that soon attracted great
notice by promenading under fire. It was a tall knight, clad in complete
brass, and carrying a light but prodigiously long lance, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)
directed the movements of the besieged. And when any disaster befell the
besiegers, this tall knight and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) long lance were pretty sure to be
concerned in it.

<p/>My young reader will say, <div class="bookquote">``Why did not Denys shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>reader</b></font>)</div>Denys did shoot
him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>); every day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) life; other arbalestriers shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>); archers shot
him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). Everybody shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was there to be shot, apparently. But the
abomination was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) did not mind being shot. Nay, worse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) got at last
so demoralised as not to seem to know when he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was shot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) walked his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
battlements under fire, as some stout skipper paces his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) deck in a
suit of Flushing, calmly oblivious of the April drops that fall on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
woollen armour. At last the besiegers got spiteful, and would not waste
any more good steel on him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>); but cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) impervious coat of
mail.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) took those missiles like the rest.


<p/>Gunpowder has spoiled war. War was always detrimental to the solid
interests of mankind. But in old times it was good for something: it
painted well, sang divinely, furnished Iliads. But invisible butchery,
under a pall of smoke a furlong thick, who is any the better for that?
Poet with his (<font color='blue'><b>Poet</b></font>) note-book may repeat, <div class="bookquote">``Suave etiam belli certamina magna
tueri;''  (<font color='red'><b>Poet</b></font>)</div>but the sentiment is hollow and savours of cuckoo. You can't
tueri anything but a horrid row. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poet</b></font>) didn't say, <div class="bookquote">``Suave etiam ingentem
caliginem tueri per campos instructam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>They managed better in the Middle Ages.

<p/>This siege was a small affair; but, such as it was, a writer or minstrel
could see it, and turn an honest penny by singing it; so far then the
sport was reasonable, and served an end.

<p/>It was a bright day, clear, but not quite frosty. The efforts of the
besieging force were concentrated against a space of about two hundred
and fifty yards, containing two curtains and two towers, one of which
was the square barbican, the other had a pointed roof that was built
to overlap, resting on a stone machicolade, and by this means a row of
dangerous crenelets between the roof and the masonry grinned down at the
nearer assailants, and looked not very unlike the grinders of a modern
frigate with each port nearly closed. The curtains were overlapped with
penthouses somewhat shattered by the mangonels, trebuchets, and other
slinging engines of the besiegers. On the besiegers' edge of the moat
was what seemed at first sight a gigantic arsenal, longer than it was
broad, peopled by human ants, and full of busy, honest industry,
and displaying all the various mechanical science of the age in full
operation. Here the lever at work, there the winch and pulley, here the
balance, there the capstan. Everywhere heaps of stones, and piles of
fascines, mantelets, and rows of fire-barrels. Mantelets rolling, the
hammer tapping all day, horses and carts in endless succession rattling
up with materials. Only, on looking closer into the hive of industry,
you might observe that arrows were constantly flying to and fro, that
the cranes did not tenderly deposit their masses of stone, but flung
them with an indifference to property, though on scientific principles,
and that among the tubs full of arrows, and the tar-barrels and the
beams, the fagots, and other utensils, here and there a workman or a
soldier lay flatter than is usual in limited naps, and something more
or less feathered stuck in them, and blood, and other essentials, oozed
out.

<p/>At the edge of the moat opposite the wooden tower, a strong penthouse,
which they called <div class="bookquote">``a cat,''  (<font color='red'><b>the workmen</b></font>)</div>might be seen stealing towards the curtain,
and gradually filling up the moat with fascines and rubbish, which the
workmen flung out at its mouth. It was advanced by two sets of ropes
passing round pulleys, and each worked by a windlass at some distance
from the cat. The knight burnt the first cat by flinging blazing
tar-barrels on it. So the besiegers made the roof of this one very
steep, and covered it with raw hides, and the tar-barrels could not harm
it. Then the knight made signs with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear, and a little trebuchet
behind the walls began dropping stones just clear of the wall into the
moat, and at last they got the range, and a stone went clean through the
roof of the cat, and made an ugly hole.

<p/>Baldwyn of Burgundy saw this, and losing his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) temper, ordered the great
catapult that was battering the wood-work of the curtain opposite it to
be turned and levelled slantwise at this invulnerable knight. Denys and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) Englishman went to dinner. These two worthies being eternally on
the watch for one another had made a sort of distant acquaintance, and
conversed by signs, especially on a topic that in peace or war maintains
the same importance. Sometimes Denys would put a piece of bread on the
top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mantelet, and then the archer would hang something of the
kind out by a string; or the order of invitation would be reversed.
Anyway, they always managed to dine together.

<p/>And now the engineers proceeded to the unusual step of slinging
fifty-pound stones at an individual.

<p/>This catapult was a scientific, simple, and beautiful engine, and very
effective in vertical fire at the short ranges of the period.

<p/>Imagine a fir-tree cut down, and set to turn round a horizontal axis on
lofty uprights, but not in equilibrio; three-fourths of the tree being
on the hither side. At the shorter and thicker end of the tree was
fastened a weight of half a ton. This butt end just before the discharge
pointed towards the enemy. By means of a powerful winch the long
tapering portion of the tree was forced down to the very ground, and
fastened by a bolt; and the stone placed in a sling attached to the
tree's nose. But this process of course raised the butt end with its
huge weight high in the air, and kept it there struggling in vain
to come down. The bolt was now drawn; Gravity, an institution which
flourished even then, resumed its sway, the short end swung furiously
down, the long end went as furiously round up, and at its highest
elevation flung the huge stone out of the sling with a tremendous jerk.
In this case the huge mass so flung missed the knight; but came down
near him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on the penthouse, and went through it like paper, making an
awful gap in roof and floor. Through the latter fell out two inanimate
objects, the stone itself and the mangled body of a besieger it had
struck. They fell down the high curtain side, down, down, and struck
almost together the sullen waters of the moat, which closed bubbling
on them, and kept both the stone and the bone two hundred years, till
cannon mocked those oft perturbed waters, and civilization dried them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha! a good shot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baldwyn</b></font>)</div>cried Baldwyn of Burgundy.

<p/>The tall knight retired. The besiegers hooted him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) reappeared on the platform of the barbican, his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) helmet being just
visible above the parapet. He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) seemed very busy, and soon an enormous
Turkish catapult made its appearance on the platform and aided by the
elevation at which it was planted, flung a twentypound stone some two
hundred and forty yards in the air; it bounded after that, and knocked
some dirt into the Lord Anthony's eye, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) swear. The next
stone struck a horse that was bringing up a sheaf of arrows in a cart,
bowled the horse over dead like a rabbit, and spilt the cart. It was
then turned at the besiegers' wooden tower, supposed to be out of shot.
Sir Turk slung stones cut with sharp edges on purpose, and struck it
repeatedly, and broke it in several places. The besiegers turned two
of their slinging engines on this monster, and kept constantly slinging
smaller stones on to the platform of the barbican, and killed two of
the engineers. But the Turk disdained to retort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) flung a forty-pound
stone on to the besiegers' great catapult, and hitting it in the
neighbourhood of the axis, knocked the whole structure to pieces, and
sent the engineers skipping and yelling.

<p/>In the afternoon, as Simon was running back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) mantelet from a
palisade where he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) had been shooting at the besieged, Denys, peeping
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) slit, saw the poor fellow suddenly stare and hold out his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
arms, then roll on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) face, and a feathered arrow protruded from his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
back. The archer showed himself a moment to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) skill. It was the
Englishman. Denys, already prepared, shot his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) bolt, and the murderous
archer staggered away wounded. But poor Simon never moved. His (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) wars were
over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am unlucky in my comrades,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys.

<p/>The next morning an unwelcome sight greeted the besieged. The cat was
covered with mattresses and raw hides, and fast filling up the moat. The
knight stoned it, but in vain; flung burning tar-barrels on it, but in
vain. Then with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own hands he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) let down by a rope a bag of burning
sulphur and pitch, and stunk them out. But Baldwyn, armed like a
lobster, ran, and bounding on the roof, cut the string, and the work
went on. Then the knight sent fresh engineers into the mine, and
undermined the place and underpinned it with beams, and covered the
beams thickly with grease and tar.

<p/>At break of day the moat was filled, and the wooden tower began to move
on its wheels towards a part of the curtain on which two catapults
were already playing to breach the hoards, and clear the way. There was
something awful and magical in its approach without visible agency, for
it was driven by internal rollers worked by leverage. On the top was a
platform, where stood the first assailing party protected in front by
the drawbridge of the turret, which stood vertical till lowered on to
the wall; but better protected by full suits of armour. The beseiged
slung at the tower, and struck it often, but in vain. It was well
defended with mattresses and hides, and presently was at the edge of the
moat. The knight bade fire the mine underneath it.

<p/>Then the Turkish engine flung a stone of half a hundredweight right
amongst the knights, and carried two away with it off the tower on to
the plain. One lay and writhed: the other neither moved nor spake.

<p/>And now the besieging catapults flung blazing tar-barrels, and fired the
hoards on both sides, and the assailants ran up the ladders behind the
tower, and lowered the drawbridge on to the battered curtain, while the
catapults in concert flung tar-barrels and fired the adjoining works
to dislodge the defenders. The armed men on the platform sprang on the
bridge, led by Baldwyn. The invulnerable knight and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) men-at-arms met
them, and a fearful combat ensued, in which many a figure was seen
to fall headlong down off the narrow bridge. But fresh besiegers kept
swarming up behind the tower, and the besieged were driven off the
bridge.

<p/>Another minute, and the town was taken; but so well had the firing of
the mine been timed, that just at this instant the underpinners gave
way, and the tower suddenly sank away from the walls, tearing the
drawbridge clear and pouring the soldiers off it against the masonry,
and on to the dry moat. The besieged uttered a fierce shout, and in a
moment surrounded Baldwyn and his (<font color='blue'><b>besiegers</b></font>) fellows; but strange to say, offered
them quarter. While a party disarmed and disposed of these, others fired
the turret in fifty places with a sort of hand grenades. At this work
who so busy as the tall knight. He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) put the fire-bags on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) long spear,
and thrust them into the doomed structure late so terrible. To do this
he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was obliged to stand on a projecting beam of the shattered hoard,
holding on by the hand of a pikeman to steady himself. This provoked
Denys; he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) ran out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mantelet, hoping to escape notice in the
confusion, and levelling his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) crossbow missed the knight clean, but sent
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) bolt into the brain of the pikeman, and the tall knight fell heavily
from the wall, lance and all. Denys gazed wonder-struck; and in that
unlucky moment, suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) arm hot, then cold, and there was
an English arrow skewering it.

<p/>This episode was unnoticed in a much greater matter. The knight, his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)
armour glittering in the morning sun, fell headlong, but turning as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)
neared the water, struck it with a slap that sounded a mile off.

<p/>None ever thought to see him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) again. But he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fell at the edge of the
fascines on which the turret stood all cocked on one side, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear
stuck into them under water, and by a mighty effort he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) got to the side,
but could not get out. Anthony sent a dozen knights with a white flag to
take him (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) prisoner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) submitted like a lamb, but said nothing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) was taken to Anthony's tent.

<p/>That worthy laughed at first at the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) muddy armour, but
presently, frowning, said, <div class="bookquote">``I marvel, sir, that so good a knight as
you should know his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) devoir so ill as turn rebel, and give us all this
trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am nun-nun-nun-nun-nun-no knight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A hosier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A what? Then thy armour shall be stripped off, and thou shalt be tied
to a stake in front of the works, and riddled with arrows for a warning
to traitors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``N-n-n-n-no! duda-duda-duda-duda-don't do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tuta-tuta-tuta-townsfolk will-h-h-h-hang t'other

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your bub-bub-bub-brother Baldwyn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, have you knaves ta’en him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The warlike hosier nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang the fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anthony/Lord Anthony</b></font>)</div>said Anthony, peevishly.

<p/>The warlike hosier watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) eye, and doffing his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) helmet, took out of
the lining an intercepted letter from the duke, bidding the said Anthony
come to court immediately, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) was to represent the court of Burgundy
at the court of England; was to go over and receive the English king's
sister, and conduct her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bridegroom, the Earl of Charolois. The
mission was one very soothing to Anthony's pride, and also to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) love
of pleasure. For Edward the Fourth held the gayest and most luxurious
court in Europe. The sly hosier saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) longed to be off, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``We'll gega-gega-gega-gega-give ye a thousand angels to raise the
siege.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Baldwyn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll gega-gega-gega-gega-go and send him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) with the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was now dinner-time; and a flag of truce being hoisted on both sides,
the sham knight and the true one dined together and came to a friendly
understanding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is your grievance, my good friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tuta-tuta-tuta-tuta-too much taxes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys, on finding the arrow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) right arm, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) back, which was
protected by a long shield, and walked sulkily into camp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was met by
the Comte de Jarnac, who had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) brilliant shot, and finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
wounded into the bargain, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) a handful of broad pieces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hast got the better of thy grief, arbalestrier, methinks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My grief, yes; but not my love. As soon as ever I have put down this
rebellion, I go to Holland, and there I shall meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>This event was nearer than Denys thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was relieved from service
next day, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) wound was no trifle, set out with a stout heart
to rejoin his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) friend in Holland.



<p/>CHAPTER XLIII

<p/>A change came over Margaret Brandt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) went about her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) household duties
like one in a dream. If Peter did but speak a little quickly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
started and fixed two terrified eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) went less often to her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
friend Margaret Van Eyck, and was ill at her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) ease when there. Instead of
meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) warm old friend's caresses, she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) used to receive them passive
and trembling, and sometimes almost shrink from them. But the most
extraordinary thing was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) never would go outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) own house in
daylight. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) went to Tergou it was after dusk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) returned
before daybreak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) would not even go to matins. At last Peter,
unobservant as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was, noticed it, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) the reason.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Methinks the folk all look at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>One day, Margaret Van Eyck asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) what was the matter.

<p/>A scared look and a flood of tears were all the reply; the old lady
expostulated gently. <div class="bookquote">``What, sweetheart, afraid to confide your sorrows
to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no sorrows, madam, but of my own making. I am kinder treated
than I deserve; especially in this house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why not come oftener, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I come oftener than I deserve;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sighed deeply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, Reicht is bawling for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret Van Eyck; <div class="bookquote">``go,
child!--what on earth can it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Turning possibilities over in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) thought Margaret must be
mortified at the contempt with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was treated by Gerard's family.
<div class="bookquote">``I will take them to task for it, at least such of them as are women;''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and the very next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hood and cloak and followed by
Reicht, went to the hosier's house. Catherine received her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with much
respect, and thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with tears for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kindness to Gerard. But
when, encouraged by this, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) visitor diverged to Margaret Brandt,
Catherine's eyes dried, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips turned to half the size, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
looked as only obstinate, ignorant women can look. When they put on
this cast of features, you might as well attempt to soften or convince a
brick wall. Margaret Van Eyck tried, but all in vain. So then, not being
herself used to be thwarted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) got provoked, and at last went out
hastily with an abrupt and mutilated curtsey, which Catherine, returned
with an air rather of defiance than obeisance. Outside the door Margaret
Van Eyck found Reicht conversing with a pale girl on crutches. Margaret
Van Eyck was pushing by them with heightened colour, and a scornful
toss intended for the whole family, when suddenly a little delicate hand
glided timidly into hers, and looking round she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) saw two dove-like eyes,
with the water in them, that sought hers gratefully and at the same time
imploringly. The old lady read this wonderful look, complex as it was,
and down went her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) choler. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stopped and kissed Kate's brow. <div class="bookquote">``I see,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mind, then, I leave it to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Returned home, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``I
have been to a house to-day, where I have seen a very common thing and
a very uncommon thing; I have seen a stupid, obstinate woman, and I have
seen an angel in the flesh, with a face-if I had it here I'd take down
my brushes once more and try and paint it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Kate did not belie the good opinion so hastily formed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
waited a better opportunity, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mother what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had learned
from Reicht Heynes, that Margaret had shed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) very blood for Gerard in
the wood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, mother, how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would not love him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, think of it! Poor thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, wench. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own trouble, no doubt, as well as we ours. I
can't abide the sight of blood, let alone my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a point gained; but when Kate tried to follow it up she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was
stopped short.

<p/>About a month after this a soldier of the Dalgetty tribe, returning from
service in Burgundy, brought a letter one evening to the hosier's house.
He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was away on business; but the rest of the family sat at Supper. The
soldier laid the letter on the table by Catherine, and refusing all
guerdon for bringing it, went off to Sevenbergen.

<p/>The letter was unfolded and spread out; and curiously enough, though not
one of them could read, they could all tell it was Gerard's handwriting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your father must be away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Are ye not ashamed of
yourselves? not one that can read your brother's letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But although the words were to them what hieroglyphics are to us, there
was something in the letter they could read. There is an art can speak
without words; unfettered by the penman's limits, it can steal through
the eye into the heart and brain, alike of the learned and unlearned;
and it can cross a frontier or a sea, yet lose nothing. It is at the
mercy of no translator; for it writes an universal language.

<p/>When, therefore, they saw this,

<p/>-LSB-a picture of two hands clasped together-RSB-

<p/>which Gerard had drawn with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pencil between the two short paragraphs,
of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) letter consisted, they read it, and it went straight to
their hearts.

<p/>Gerard was bidding them farewell.

<p/>As they gazed on that simple sketch, in every turn and line of which
they recognized his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) manner, Gerard seemed present, and bidding them
farewell.

<p/>The women wept over it till they could see it no longer.

<p/>Giles said, <div class="bookquote">``Poor Gerard!''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>in a lower voice than seemed to belong to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).

<p/>Even Cornelis and Sybrandt felt a momentary remorse, and sat silent and
gloomy.

<p/>But how to get the words read to them. They were loth to show their
ignorance and their emotion to a stranger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Dame Van Eyck?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I will, Kate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) has a good heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) loves Gerard, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
will be glad to hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). I was short with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) came here;
but I will make my submission, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) will tell me what my poor
child says to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was soon at Margaret Van Eyck's house. Reicht took her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) into a room,
and said, <div class="bookquote">``Bide a minute; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) orisons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a young woman in the room seated pensively by the stove; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rose and courteously made way for the visitor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, young lady; the winter nights are cold, and your stove is a
treat.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>Catherine then, while warming her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands, inspected her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion
furtively from head to foot, inclusive. The young person wore an
ordinary wimple, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gown was trimmed with fur, which was, in those
days, almost a sign of superior rank or wealth. But what most struck
Catherine was the candour and modesty of the face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt sure of
sympathy from so good a countenance, and began to gossip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what think you brings me here, young lady? It is a letter! a
letter from my poor boy that is far away in some savage part or other.
And I take shame to say that none of us can read it. I wonder whether
you can read?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can ye, now? It is much to your credit, my dear. I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) won't
be long; but every minute is an hour to a poor longing mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will read it to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, my dear; bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) unfeigned eagerness she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) never noticed the suppressed eagerness
with which the hand was slowly put out to take the letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not
see the tremor with which the fingers closed on it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then, read it to me, prithee. I am wearying for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``The first words are, `To my honoured parents.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! and he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) always did honour us, poor soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div><p/>```God and the saints have you in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) holy keeping, and bless you by
night and by day. Your one harsh deed is forgotten; your years of love
remembered.'''

<p/>Catherine laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bosom, and sank back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chair with
one long sob.

<p/>``Then comes this, madam. It doth speak for itself; `a long farewell.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, go on; bless you, girl you give me sorry comfort. Still `tis
comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brothers</b></font>)</div><p/>```To my brothers Cornelis and Sybrandt--Be content; you will see me no
more!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does that mean? Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>```To my sister Kate. Little angel of my father's house. Be kind to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)--' Ah!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is Margaret Brandt, my dear--his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sweetheart, poor soul. I've not
been kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>), my dear. Forgive me, Gerard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>```--for poor Gerard's sake: since grief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is death to me--Ah!''
And nature, resenting the poor girl's struggle for unnatural composure,
suddenly gave way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sank from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) chair and lay insensible, with
the letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hand and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) head on Catherine's knees.



<p/>CHAPTER XLIV

<p/>Experienced women are not frightened when a woman faints, or do they
hastily attribute it to anything but physical causes, which they have
often seen produce it. Catherine bustled about; laid the girl down with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head on the floor quite flat, opened the window, and unloosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
dress as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lay. Not till she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had done all this did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) step to the
door and say, rather loudly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret Van Eyck and Reicht came, and found Margaret lying quite flat,
and Catherine beating her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my poor girl! What have you done to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has happened, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, madam; nothing more than is natural in her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) situation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret Van Eyck coloured with ire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do well to speak so coolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you that are the cause of
her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) situation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I am not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine bluntly; <div class="bookquote">``nor any woman born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! was it not you and your husband that kept them apart? and now he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
has gone to Italy all alone. Situation indeed! You have broken her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart
amongst you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, madam? Who is it then? in Heaven's name! To hear you, one would
think this was my Gerard's lass. But that can't be. This fur never cost
less than five crowns the ell; besides, this young gentlewoman is a
wife; or ought to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ought. And who is the cause she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is none? Who came before
them at the very altar?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God forgive them, whoever it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine gravely; <div class="bookquote">``me it was
not, nor my man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, a little softened, <div class="bookquote">``now you have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
perhaps you will not be quite so bitter against her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) madam. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is coming
to, thank Heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me bitter against her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``no, that is all over. Poor
soul! trouble behind her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and trouble afore her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and to think of my
setting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), of all living women, to read Gerard's letter to me. Ay, and
that was what made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) go off, I'll be sworn. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is coming to. What,
sweetheart! be not afeard, none are here but friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>They seated her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in an easy chair. As the colour was creeping back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
face and lips. Catherine drew Margaret Van Eyck aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) staying with you, if you please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, madam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't let her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) go back to Sevenbergen to-night, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is as she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) pleases. She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) still refuses to bide the night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but you are older than she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is; you can make her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>). There, she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is
beginning to notice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine then put her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mouth to Margaret Van Eyck's ear for half a
moment; it did not seem time enough to whisper a word, far less a
sentence. But on some topics females can flash communication to female
like lightning, or thought itself.

<p/>The old lady started, and whispered back--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's false! it is a calumny! it is monstrous! look at her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) face. It is
blasphemy to accuse such a face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut! tut! tut!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other; <div class="bookquote">``you might as well say this is not my
hand. I ought to know; and I tell ye it is so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, much to Margaret Van Eyck's surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) went up to the girl, and
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) round the neck, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suffered for Gerard, and you shed your blood for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) I do hear; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
own words show me that I have been to blame, the very words you have
read to me. Ay, Gerard, my child, I have held aloof from her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>); but I'll
make it up to her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) once I begin. You are my daughter from this hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Another warm embrace sealed this hasty compact, and the woman of impulse
was gone.

<p/>Margaret lay back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) chair, and a feeble smile stole over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face.
Gerard's mother had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and called her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) daughter; but the next
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) old friend looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with a vexed air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you let that woman kiss you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>murmured Margaret, half reproachfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, or no mother, you would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) touch you if you knew what
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whispered in my ear about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, about you, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never saw till to-night.''  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>The old lady was
proceeding, with some hesitation and choice of language, to make
Margaret share her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) indignation, when an unlooked-for interruption closed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lips.

<p/>The young woman slid from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chair to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees, and began to pray
piteously to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for pardon. From the words and the manner of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
penitence a bystander would have gathered she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had inflicted some cruel
wrong, some intolerable insult, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) venerable friend.



<p/>CHAPTER XLV

<p/>The little party at the hosier's house sat at table discussing the
recent event, when their mother returned, and casting a piercing glance
all round the little circle, laid the letter flat on the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
repeated every word of it by memory, following the lines with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
finger, to cheat herself and bearers into the notion that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could read
the words, or nearly. Then, suddenly lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cast another
keen look on Cornelis and Sybrandt: their eyes fell.

<p/>On this the storm that had long been brewing burst on their heads.

<p/>Catherine seemed to swell like an angry hen ruffling her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feathers, and
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mouth came a Rhone and Saone of wisdom and twaddle, of great
and mean invective, such as no male that ever was born could utter in
one current; and not many women.

<p/>The following is a fair though a small sample of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) words: only they
were uttered all in one breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have long had my doubts that you blew the flame betwixt Gerard and
your father, and set that old rogue, Ghysbrecht, on. And now, here are
Gerard's own written words to prove it. You have driven your own flesh
and blood into a far land, and robbed the mother that bore you of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
darling, the pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eye, the joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart. But you are all of
a piece from end to end. When you were all boys together, my others were
a comfort; but you were a curse: mischievous and sly; and took a woman
half a day to keep your clothes whole: for why? work wears cloth, but
play cuts it. With the beard comes prudence; but none came to you:
still the last to go to bed, and the last to leave it; and why? because
honesty goes to bed early, and industry rises betimes; where there are
two lie-a-beds in a house there are a pair of ne’er-do-weels. Often I've
sat and looked at your ways, and wondered where ye came from: ye don't
take after your father, and ye are no more like me than a wasp is to an
ant; sure ye were changed in the cradle, or the cuckoo dropped ye on my
floor: for ye have not our hands, nor our hearts: of all my blood, none
but you ever jeered them that God afflicted; but often when my back was
turned I've heard you mock at Giles, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) is not as big as some;
and at my lily Kate, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is not so strong as a Flanders mare.
After that rob a church an you will! for you can be no worse in His (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) eyes
that made both Kate and Giles, and in mine that suffered for them, poor
darlings, as I did for you, you paltry, unfeeling, treasonable curs!
No, I will not hush, my daughter, they have filled the cup too full. It
takes a deal to turn a mother's heart against the sons she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has nursed
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knees; and many is the time I have winked and wouldn't see too
much, and bitten my tongue, lest their father should know them as I do;
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have put them to the door that moment. But now they have filled
the cup too full. And where got ye all this money? For this last month
you have been rolling in it. You never wrought for it. I wish I may
never hear from other mouths how ye got it. It is since that night you
were out so late, and your head came back so swelled, Cornelis. Sloth
and greed are ill-mated, my masters. Lovers of money must sweat or
steal. Well, if you robbed any poor soul of it, it was some woman, I'll
go bail; for a man would drive you with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) naked hand. No matter, it is
good for one thing. It has shown me how you will guide our gear if ever
it comes to be yourn. I have watched you, my lads, this while. You have
spent a groat to-day between you. And I spend scarce a groat a week, and
keep you all, good and bad. No I give up waiting for the shoes that will
maybe walk behind your coffin; for this shop and this house shall never
be yourn. Gerard is our heir; poor Gerard, whom you have banished and
done your best to kill; after that never call me mother again! But you
have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tenfold dearer to me. My poor lost boy! I shall soon see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) again shall hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in my arms, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) on my knees. Ay, you
may stare! You are too crafty, and yet not crafty enow. You cut the
stalk away; but you left the seed--the seed that shall outgrow you, and
outlive you. Margaret Brandt is quick, and it is Gerard's, and what is
Gerard's is mine; and I have prayed the saints it may be a boy; and it
will--it must. Kate, when I found it was so, my bowels yearned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
child unborn as if it had been my own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is our heir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will outlive
us. You will not; for a bad heart in a carcass is like the worm in the
nut, soon brings the body to dust. So, Kate, take down Gerard's bib and
tucker that are in the drawer you wot of, and one of these days we will
carry them to Sevenbergen. We will borrow Peter Buyskens' cart, and
go comfort Gerard's wife under her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) burden. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wife. Who is
Ghysbrecht Van Swieten? Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) come between a couple and the altar, and
sunder those that God and the priest make one? She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is my daughter, and
I am as proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as I am of you, Kate, almost; and as for you, keep
out of my way awhile, for you are like the black dog in my eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cornelis</b></font>)</div><p/>Cornelis and Sybrandt took the hint and slunk out, aching with remorse,
and impenitence, and hate. They avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eye as much as ever
they could; and for many days she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) never spoke a word, good, bad, or
indifferent, to either of them. Liberaverat animum suum.



<p/>CHAPTER XLVI

<p/>Catherine was a good housewife who seldom left home for a day, and then
one thing or another always went amiss. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was keenly conscious of
this, and watching for a slack tide in things domestic, put off her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
visit to Sevenbergen from day to day, and one afternoon that it really
could have been managed, Peter Buyskens' mule was out of the way.

<p/>At last, one day Eli asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) before all the family, whether it was
true she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had thought of visiting Margaret Brandt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, my man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I do forbid you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there is no more to be said, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), colouring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>replied Eli sternly.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was very severe, not upon Eli,
but upon herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Behoved me rather go thither like a cat at a robin. But this was me all
over. I am like a silly hen that can lay no egg without cackling, and
convening all the house to rob her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) on't. Next time you and I are after
aught the least amiss, let's do't in Heaven's name then and there, and
not take time to think about it, far less talk; so then, if they take us
to task we can say, alack we knew nought; we thought no ill; now, who'd
ever? and so forth. For two pins I'd go thither in all their teeth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Defiance so wild and picturesque staggered Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, mother, with
patience father will come round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so will Michaelmas; but when? and I was so bent on you seeing the
girl. Then we could have put our heads together about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Say what they
will, there is no judging body or beast but by the eye. And were I to
have fifty more sons I'd ne’er thwart one of them's fancy, till such
time as I had clapped my eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and seen Quicksands; say you,
I should have thought of that before condemning Gerard his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fancy; but
there, life is a school, and the lesson ne’er done; we put down one
fault and take up t'other, and so go blundering here, and blundering
there, till we blunder into our graves, and there's an end of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what is a-coming now? no good news though, by the look of you.
What on earth can make the poor wretch so scared?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An avowal she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) hath to make,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>faltered Kate faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, there is a noble word for ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine proudly. <div class="bookquote">``Our Gerard
taught thee that, I'll go bail. Come then, out with thy vowel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, sooth to say, I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And spoken with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) to boot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And never told me? After this marvels are dirt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, you were so hot against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). I waited till I could tell you
without angering you worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, half sadly, half bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``like mother, like
daughter; cowardice it is our bane. The others I whiles buffet, or how
would the house fare? but did you, Kate, ever have harsh word or look
from your poor mother, that you--Nay, I will not have ye cry, girl; ten
to one ye had your reason; so rise up, brave heart, and tell me all,
better late than ne’er; and first and foremost when ever, and how ever,
wend you to Sevenbergen wi' your poor crutches, and I not know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never was there in my life; and, mammy dear, to say that I ne’er
wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that I will not, but I ne’er went nor sought to see

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine disputatively, ``said I not `twas all unlike
my girl to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) unbeknown to me? Come now, for I'm all agog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then thus `twas. It came to my ears, no matter how, and prithee, good
mother, on my knees ne’er ask me how, that Gerard was a prisoner in the
Stadthouse tower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By father's behest as `twas pretended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine uttered a sigh that was almost a moan. <div class="bookquote">``Blacker than I
thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) muttered faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Giles and I went out at night to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) be of good cheer. And there at
the tower foot was a brave lass, quite strange to me I vow, on the same
errand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lookee there now, Kate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At first we did properly frighten one another, through the place his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did one ever? `Twas Gerard! He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will have been talking backards and

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>In return for this, Kate bestowed on Catherine one of the prettiest
presents in nature--the composite kiss, i.e., she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) imprinted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cheek
a single kiss, which said--

<p/>1. Quite correct.
2. Good, clever mother, for guessing so right and quick.
3. How sweet for us twain to be' of one mind again after
never having been otherwise.
4. Etc..

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, speak thy mind, child, Gerard is not here. Alas, what am I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sevenbergen is farther from the Stadthouse than we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate
thoughtfully; <div class="bookquote">``yet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was there afore me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine nodded intelligence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, more, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had got him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out ere I came. Ay, down from the captive's
tower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head incredulously. <div class="bookquote">``The highest tower for miles! It
is not feasible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis sooth though. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and an old man she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brought found means and wit
to send him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up a rope. There `twas dangling from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prison, and our
Giles went up it. When first I saw it hang, I said, `This is glamour.'
But when the frank lass's arms came round me, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) bosom' did beat
on mine, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) cheeks wet, then said I, `'Tis not glamour: `tis love.'
For she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) is not like me, but lusty and able; and, dear heart, even I,
poor frail creature, do feel sometimes as I could move the world for
them I love: I love you, mother. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loves Gerard.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for't! God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what, lamb?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) love, is it for very certain honest? `Tis most strange; but that
very thing, which hath warmed your heart, hath somewhat cooled mine

done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! They have stood at the altar together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but they went as they came, maid and bachelor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The parson, saith he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, for that I know not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll take no man's word but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in such a tangled skein.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After some reflection she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Natheless art right, girl; I'll to
Sevenbergen alone. A wife I am but not a slave. We are all in the dark
here. And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) holds the clue. I must question her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and no one by; least
of all you. I'll not take any lily to a house Wi' a spot, no, not to a
palace o' gold and silver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The more Catherine pondered this conversation, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt drawn
towards Margaret, and moreover <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was all agog''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>with curiosity, a
potent passion with us all, and nearly omnipotent with those who like
Catherine, do not slake it with reading. At last, one fine day, after
dinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whispered to Kate, <div class="bookquote">``Keep the house from going to pieces, an
ye can;''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>and donned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) best kirtle and hood, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) scarlet clocked
hose and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) new shoes, and trudged briskly off to Sevenbergen,
troubling no man's mule.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) got there she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) inquired where Margaret Brandt lived. The first
person she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and said--<div class="bookquote">``The name is strange to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went a little farther and asked a girl of about fifteen who was
standing at a door. <div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, speaking into the house,
<div class="bookquote">``here is another after that magician's daughter.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>The man came out and
told Catherine Peter Brandt's cottage was just outside the town on the
east side. <div class="bookquote">``You may see the chimney hence;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) pointed it out to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But you will not find them there, neither father nor daughter;
they have left the town this week, bless you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say not so, good man, and me walken all the way from Tergou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From Tergou? then you must ha' met the soldier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What soldier? ay, I did meet a soldier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, yon soldier was here seeking that self-same Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, and warn't a mad with us because she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>put in the girl.
<div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) long beard and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cheek are no strangers, I warrant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say no more than ye know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine sharply. ``You are young to
take to slandering your elders. Stay! tell we more about this soldier,
good man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I know no more than that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came hither seeking Margaret Brandt,
and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father had made a moonlight flit on't this
day sennight, and that some thought the devil had flown away with them,
being magicians. `And,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), `the devil fly away with thee for thy
ill news;' that was my thanks. `But I doubt `tis a lie,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). `An
you think so,' said I, `go and see.' `I will,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), and burst out
wi' a hantle o' gibberish: my wife thinks `twas curses; and hied him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to
the cottage. Presently back a comes, and sings t'other tune. `You were
right and I was wrong,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), and shoves a silver coin in my hand.
Show it the wife, some of ye; then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll believe me; I have been called
a liar once to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It needs not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, inspecting the coin all the same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) seemed quiet and sad like, didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) now, wench?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That a did,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the young woman warmly; <div class="bookquote">``and, dame, he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) was just as
pretty a man as ever I clapped eyes on. Cheeks like a rose, and shining
beard, and eyes in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head like sloes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was well bearded,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``but, for the rest, at my
age I scan them not as when I was young and foolish. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed right
civil: doffed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bonnet to me as I had been a queen, and I did drop him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
my best reverence, for manners beget manners. But little I wist he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
been her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) light o' love, and most likely the--Who bakes for this town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>The man, not being acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes at this
transition, swift and smooth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dame, there be two; John Bush and Eric Donaldson, they both bide
in this street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, God be with you, good people,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and proceeded; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
sprightly foot came flat on the ground now, and no longer struck it with
little jerks and cocking heel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked the bakers whether Peter
Brandt had gone away in their debt. Bush said they were not customers.
Donaldson said, <div class="bookquote">``Not a stiver: his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) daughter had come round and paid
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the very night they went. Didn't believe they owed a copper in the
town.''  (<font color='red'><b>Donaldson</b></font>)</div>So Catherine got all the information of that kind she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wanted with
very little trouble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me what sort this Margaret was?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned
to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, somewhat too reserved for my taste. I like a chatty
customer--when I'm not too busy. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bore a high character for being
a good daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis no small praise. A well-looking lass, I am told?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, whence come you, wyfe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From Tergou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ay. Well you shall judge: the lads clept her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) `the beauty of
Sevenbergen;' the lasses did scout it merrily, and terribly pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
to pieces, and found so many faults no two could agree where the fault
lay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``I see, the bakers are no fools in
Sevenbergen, and the young women no shallower than in other burghs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bought a manchet of bread, partly out of sympathy and justice -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
kept a shop-RRB-, partly to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) household how much better bread she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
gave them daily; and returned to Tergou dejected.

<p/>Kate met her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) outside the town with beaming eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Kate, lass, it is a happy thing I went; I am heartbroken. Gerard
has been sore abused. The child is none of ourn, nor the mother from
this hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, mother, I fathom not your meaning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask me no more, girl, but never mention her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name to me again. That is
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate acquiesced with a humble sigh, and they went home together.

<p/>They found a soldier seated tranquilly by their fire. The moment they
entered the door he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) rose, and saluted them civilly. They stood and
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>); Kate with some little surprise, but Catherine with a
great deal, and with rising indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>was Catherine's greeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to seek after Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we know no such person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say not so, dame; sure you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) by name, Margaret Brandt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) for that matter--to our cost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Comes, dame, prithee tell me at least where she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know not where she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bides, and care not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys felt sure this was a deliberate untruth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I
looked to find myself in an enemy's country at this Tergou; but maybe if
ye knew all ye would not be so dour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do know all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>replied Catherine bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``This morn I knew nought.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then suddenly setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arms akimbo she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) with a raised voice
and flashing eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) cheek sitting down by that hearth
of all hearths in the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May Satan fly away with your hearth to the lake of fire and brimstone,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>shouted Denys, who could speak Flemish fluently. <div class="bookquote">``Your own servant bade
me sit there till you came, else I had ne’er troubled your hearth. My
malison on it, and on the churlish roof-tree that greets an unoffending
stranger this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) strode scowling to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Catherine, frightened, and also a little
conscience-stricken; and the virago sat suddenly down and burst into
tears. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter followed suit quietly, but without loss of time.

<p/>A shrewd writer, now unhappily lost to us, has somewhere the following
dialogue:

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I feel all a woman's weakness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Then you are invincible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys, by anticipation, confirmed that valuable statement; he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) stood at
the door looking ruefully at the havoc his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) thunderbolt of eloquence had
made.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``weep not neither for a soldier's hasty word. I
mean not all I said. Why, your house is your own, and what right in it
have I? There now, I'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a grave manly voice.

<p/>It was Eli; he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) had come in from the shop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is a ruffian been a-scolding of your women folk and making them
cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>explained Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Little Kate, what is't? for ruffians do not use to call themselves
ruffians,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli the sensible.

<p/>Ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could explain, <div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``Muriel
bade him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) sat down, and I knew not that, and wyted on him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was
going and leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) malison on us, root and branch. I was never so
becursed in all my days, oh! oh! oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were both somewhat to blame; both you and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli calmly.
<div class="bookquote">``However, what the servant says the master should still stand to. We
keep not open house, but yet we are not poor enough to grudge a seat at
our hearth in a cold day to a wayfarer with an honest face, and, as I
think, a wounded man. So, end all malice, and sit ye down!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wounded?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother daughter</b></font>)</div>cried mother and daughter in a breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think you a soldier slings his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) arm for sport?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, `tis but an arrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But an arrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, with concentrated horror. <div class="bookquote">``Where were our
eyes, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, in good sooth, a trifle. Which, however, I will pray mesdames to
accept as an excuse for my vivacity. `Tis these little foolish trifling
wounds that fret a man, worthy sir. Why, look ye now, sweeter temper
than our Gerard never breathed, yet, when the bear did but strike a
piece no bigger than a crown out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) calf, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned so hot and
choleric y’had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was no son of yours, but got by the good knight
Sir John Pepper on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pepper</b></font>) wife dame Mustard; who is this? a dwarf? your
servant, Master Giles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your servant, soldier,''  (<font color='red'><b>the newcomer</b></font>)</div>roared the newcomer. Denys started. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had not
counted on exchanging greetings with a petard.

<p/>Denys's words had surprised his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hosts, but hardly more than their
deportment now did him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). They all three came creeping up to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sat,
and looked down into him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) with their lips parted, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had been some
strange phenomenon.

<p/>And growing agitation succeeded to amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli, <div class="bookquote">``let none speak but I. Young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>)
solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``in God's name who are you, that know us though we know you
not, and that shake our hearts speaking to us of--the absent-our poor
rebellious son: whom Heaven forgive and bless?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``hath he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) not writ to
you? hath he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) not told you of me, Denys of Burgundy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hath writ, but three lines, and named not Denys of Burgundy, nor any
stranger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, I mind the long letter was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sweetheart, this Margaret, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) has decamped, plague take her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and how I am to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) Heaven

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is not your sweetheart then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who, dame? an't please you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Margaret Brandt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can my comrade's sweetheart be mine? I know her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) not from Noah's
niece; how should I? I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whist with this idle chat, Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``and let the
young man answer me. How came you to know Gerard, our son? Prithee now
think on a parent's cares, and answer me straightforward, like a soldier
as thou art.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall. I was paid off at Flushing, and started for Burgundy. On
the German frontier I lay at the same inn with Gerard. I fancied him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). I
said, `Be my comrade.' He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was loth at first; consented presently. Many a
weary league we trode together. Never were truer comrades: never will be
while earth shall last. First I left my route a bit to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>): then
he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) to be with me. We talked of Sevenbergen and Tergou a thousand
times; and of all in this house. We had our troubles on the road; but
battling them together made them light. I saved his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) life from a bear; he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>)
mine in the Rhine: for he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) swims like a duck and I like a hod o' bricks
and one another's lives at an inn in Burgundy, where we two held a room
for a good hour against seven cut-throats, and crippled one and slew
two; and your son did his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) devoir like a man, and met the stoutest
champion I ever countered, and spitted him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) like a sucking-pig. Else I
had not been here. But just when all was fair, and I was to see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) safe
aboard ship for Rome, if not to Rome itself, met us that son of a--the
Lord Anthony of Burgundy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) men, making for Flanders, then in
insurrection, tore us by force apart, took me where I got some broad
pieces in hand, and a broad arrow in my shoulder, and left my poor
Gerard lonesome. At that sad parting, soldier though I be, these eyes
did rain salt scalding tears, and so did his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), poor soul. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) last word
to me was, `Go, comfort Margaret!' so here I be. Mine to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was, `Think
no more of Rome. Make for Rhine, and down stream home.' Now say, for you
know best, did I advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) well or ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Soldier, take my hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli. <div class="bookquote">``God bless thee! God bless thee!''
 (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) lip quivered. It was all his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) reply, but more eloquent than many
words.

<p/>Catherine did not answer at all, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) darted from the room and bade
Muriel bring the best that was in the house, and returned with wood in
both arms, and heaped the fire, and took out a snow-white cloth from
the press, and was going in a great hurry to lay it for Gerard's friend,
when suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>) sat down and all the power ebbed rapidly out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>)
body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>cried Kate, whose eye was as quick as her (<font color='blue'><b>Muriel</b></font>) affection.

<p/>Denys started up; but Eli waved him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) back and flung a little water
sharply in his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) wife's face. This did her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) instant good. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gasped, <div class="bookquote">``So
sudden. My poor boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Eli whispered Denys, <div class="bookquote">``Take no notice! she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thinks
of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) night and day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>They pretended not to observe her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shook
it off, and hustled and laid the cloth with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own hands; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
smoothed it, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands trembled and a tear or two stole down her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/>They could not make enough of Denys. They stuffed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), and crammed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>);
and then gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) and kept filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) glass in turn, while by
that genial blaze of fire and ruby wine and eager eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) told all that
I have related, and a vast number of minor details, which an artist,
however minute, omits.

<p/>But how different the effect on my readers and on this small circle! To
them the interest was already made before the first word came from his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>)
lips. It was all about Gerard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) who sat there telling it them, was
warm from Gerard and an actor with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in all these scenes.

<p/>The flesh and blood around that fire quivered for their severed member,
hearing its struggles and perils.

<p/>I shall ask my readers to recall to memory all they can of Gerard's
journey with Denys, and in their mind's eye to see those very matters
told by his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) comrade to an exile's father, all stoic outside, all father
within, and to two poor women, an exile's mother and a sister, who were
all love and pity and tender anxiety both outside and in. Now would you
mind closing this book for a minute and making an effort to realize all
this? It will save us so much repetition.


<p/>Then you will not be surprised when I tell you that after a while Giles
came softly and curled himself up before the fire, and lay gazing at the
speaker with a reverence almost canine; and that, when the rough soldier
had unconsciously but thoroughly betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) better qualities, and
above all his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) rare affection for Gerard, Kate, though timorous as a
bird, stole her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) little hand into the warrior's huge brown palm, where
it lay an instant like a tea-spoonful of cream spilt on a platter, then
nipped the ball of his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) thumb and served for a Kardiometer. In other
words, Fate is just even to rival storytellers, and balances matters.
Denys had to pay a tax to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) audience which I have not. Whenever Gerard
was in too much danger, the female faces became so white, and their poor
little throats gurgled so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was obliged in common humanity to
spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) recital. Suspense is the soul of narrative, and thus dealt
Rough-and-Tender of Burgundy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) best suspenses. <div class="bookquote">``Now, dame, take
not on till ye hear the end; ma’amselle, let not your cheek blanch so;
courage! it looks ugly; but you shall hear how we won through. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
miscarried, and I at hand, would I be alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>And meantime Kate's little Kardiometer, or heart-measurer, graduated
emotion, and pinched by scale. At its best it was by no means a
high-pressure engine. But all is relative. Denys soon learned the tender
gamut; and when to water the suspense, and extract the thrill as far as
possible. On one occasion only he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) cannily indemnified his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) narrative for
this drawback. Falling personally into the Rhine, and sinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) got
pinched, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) Denys, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) surprise and satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">``Oho!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>),
and on the principle of the anatomists, <div class="bookquote">``experimentum in corpore vili,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the anatomists</b></font>)</div>kept himself a quarter of an hour under water; under pressure all the
time. And even when Gerard had got hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was loth to leave the
river, so, less conscientious than I was, swam with Gerard to the east
bank first, and was about to land, but detected the officers and their
intent, chaffed them a little space, treading water, then turned and
swam wearily all across, and at last was obliged to get out, for very
shame, or else acknowledge himself a pike; so permitted himself to land,
exhausted: and the pressure relaxed.


<p/>It was eleven o’clock, an unheard-of hour, but they took no note of time
this night; and Denys had still much to tell them, when the door was
opened quietly, and in stole Cornelis and Sybrandt looking hang-dog.
They had this night been drinking the very last drop of their mysterious
funds.

<p/>Catherine feared her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) husband would rebuke them before Denys; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) only
looked sadly at them, and motioned them to sit down quietly.

<p/>Denys it was who seemed discomposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) knitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) brows and eyed them
thoughtfully and rather gloomily. Then turned to Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``What say
you, dame? the rest to-morrow; for I am somewhat weary, and it waxes
late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli. But when Denys rose to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) inn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was
instantly stopped by Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``And think you to lie from this house?
Gerard's room has been got ready for you hours agone; the sheets I'll
not say much for, seeing I spun the flax and wove the web.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then would I lie in them blindfold,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the gallant reply. ``Ah, dame,
our poor Gerard was the one for fine linen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could hardly forgive the
honest Germans their coarse flax, and whene’er my traitors of countrymen
did amiss, a would excuse them, saying, `Well, well; bonnes toiles sont
en Bourgogne:' that means, there be good lenten cloths in Burgundy.' But
indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) beat all for bywords and cleanliness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Eli! Eli! doth not our son come back to us at each word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay. Buss me, my poor Kate. You and I know all that passeth in each
other's hearts this night. None other can, but God.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLVII

<p/>Denys took an opportunity next day and told mother and daughter the
rest, excusing himself characteristically for not letting Cornelis and
Sybrandt hear of it. <div class="bookquote">``It is not for me to blacken them; they come of
a good stock. But Gerard looks on them as no friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in this
matter; and I'm Gerard's comrade and it is a rule with us soldiers not
to tell the enemy aught--but lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine sighed, but made no answer.

<p/>The adventures he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) related cost them a tumult of agitation and grief, and
sore they wept at the parting of the friends, which even now Denys could
not tell without faltering. But at last all merged in the joyful hope
and expectation of Gerard's speedy return. In this Denys confidently
shared; but reminded them that was no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) should neglect his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
friend's wishes and last words. In fact, should Gerard return next week,
and no Margaret to be found, what sort of figure should he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cut?

<p/>Catherine had never felt so kindly towards the truant Margaret as now;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was fully as anxious to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and be kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) before
Gerard's return, as Denys was; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) that
anything was to be gained by leaving this neighbourhood to search for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) must have told somebody whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was going. It is not
as though they were dishonest folk flying the country; they owe not a
stiver in Sevenbergen; and dear heart, Denys, you can't hunt all Holland
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys grimly. <div class="bookquote">``That we shall see.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) added, after
some reflection, that they must divide their forces; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stay here with
eyes and ears wide open, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) ransack every town in Holland for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
if need be. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) will not be many leagues from here. They be three.
Three fly not so fast, nor far, as one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) going first to
the demoiselle Van Eyck. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) and our Margaret were bosom friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
knows where the girl is gone, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) will but tell us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>Denys was for
going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) that instant, so Catherine, in a turn of the hand, made
herself one shade neater, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was received graciously by the old lady sitting in a richly
furnished room; and opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) business. The tapestry dropped out of
Margaret Van Eyck's hands. <div class="bookquote">``Gone? Gone from Sevenbergen and not told me;
the thankless girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the visitors</b></font>)</div><p/>This turn greatly surprised the visitors. <div class="bookquote">``What, you know not? when was
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe ten days agone. I had ta’en out my brushes, after so many years,
to paint her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) portrait. I did not do it, though; for reasons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine remarked it was ``a most strange thing she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should go away bag
and baggage like this, without with your leave or by your leave, why, or
wherefore. Was ever aught so untoward; just when all our hearts are warm
to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and here is Gerard's mate come from the ends of the earth with
comfort for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from Gerard, and can't find her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and Gerard himself
expected. What to do I know not. But sure she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not parted like this
without a reason. Can ye not give us the clue, my good demoiselle?
Prithee now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have it not to give,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the elder lady, rather peevishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht Heynes, showing herself in the doorway, with
colour somewhat heightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you have been hearkening all the time, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are my ears for, mistress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True. Well, throw us the light of thy wisdom on this dark matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no darkness that I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Reicht. <div class="bookquote">``And the clue, why, an
ye call't a two-plye twine, and the ends on't in this room e'en now,
ye'll not be far out. Oh, mistress, I wonder at you sitting there
pretending.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry, come up.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>and the mistress's cheek was now nearly as red as the
servant's. <div class="bookquote">``So `twas I drove the foolish girl away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did your share, mistress. What sort of greeting gave you her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
last time she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) came? Think you she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could miss to notice it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) all
friendless? And you said, `I have altered my mind about painting of
you,' says you, a turning up your nose at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not turn up my nose. It is not shaped like yours for looking
heavenward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, all our nosen can follow our heartys bent, for that matter. Poor
soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) did come into the kitchen to me. `I am not to be painted now,'
said she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), and the tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said no more. But I knew well
what she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) did mean. I had seen ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret Van Eyck, ``I do confess so much, and I make you
the judge, madam. Know that these young girls can do nothing of their
own heads, but are most apt at mimicking aught their sweethearts do. Now
your Gerard is reasonably handy at many things, and among the rest at
the illuminator's craft. And Margaret she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pupil, and a patient
one: what marvel? having a woman's eye for colour, and eke a lover to
ape. `Tis a trick I despise at heart: for by it the great art of colour,
which should be royal, aspiring, and free, becomes a poor slave to the
petty crafts of writing and printing, and is fettered, imprisoned, and
made little, body and soul, to match the littleness of books, and go to
church in a rich fool's pocket. Natheless affection rules us all, and
when the poor wench would bring me her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thorn leaves, and lilies, and
ivy, and dewberries, and ladybirds, and butterfly grubs, and all the
scum of Nature-stuck fast in gold-leaf like wasps in a honey-pot, and
withal her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) diurnal book, showing she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had pored an hundred, or an hundred
and fifty, or two hundred hours over each singular page, certes I was
wroth that an immortal soul, and many hours of labour, and much manual
skill, should be flung away on Nature's trash, leaves, insects, grubs,
and on barren letters; but, having bowels, I did perforce restrain, and
as it were, dam my better feelings, and looked kindly at the work to
see how it might be bettered; and said I, `Sith Heaven for our sins
hath doomed us to spend time, and soul, and colour on great letters and
little beetles, omitting such small fry as saints and heroes, their
acts and passions, why not present the scum naturally?' I told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) `the
grapes I saw, walking abroad, did hang i' the air, not stick in a wall;
and even these insects,' quo' I, `and Nature her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) slime in general, pass
not their noxious lives wedged miserably in metal prisons like flies
in honey-pots and glue-pots, but do crawl or hover at large, infesting
air.' `Ah my dear friend,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), `I see now whither you drive; but
this ground is gold; whereon we may not shade.' `Who said so?' quoth
I. `All teachers of this craft,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); and -LRB-to make an end o' me at
once, I trow-RRB- `Gerard himself!' `That for Gerard himself,' quoth I, `and
all the gang; gi’e me a brush!'

<p/>``Then chose I, to shade her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fruit and reptiles, a colour false in
nature, but true relatively to that monstrous ground of glaring gold;
and in five minutes out came a bunch of raspberries, stalk and all, and
a'most flew in your mouth; likewise a butterfly grub she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had so truly
presented as might turn the stoutest stomach. My lady she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) flings her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
arms round my neck, and says she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), `Oh!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The little love!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>observed Denys, succeeding at last in wedging in a
word.

<p/>Margaret Van Eyck stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>); and then smiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) went on to tell
them how from step to step she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) had been led on to promise to resume the
art she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) had laid aside with a sigh when her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) brothers died, and to paint
the Madonna once more--with Margaret for model. Incidentally she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) even
revealed how girls are turned into saints. <div class="bookquote">``Thy hair is adorable,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said
I. <div class="bookquote">``Why, `tis red,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>quo' she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>quoth I, <div class="bookquote">``but what a red! how brown!
how glossy! most hair is not worth a straw to us painters; thine the
artist's very hue. But thy violet eyes, which smack of earth, being now
languid for lack of one Gerard, now full of fire in hopes of the same
Gerard, these will I lift to heaven in fixed and holy meditation, and
thy nose, which doth already somewhat aspire that way -LRB-though not so
piously as Reicht's-RRB-, will I debase a trifle, and somewhat enfeeble thy
chin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enfeeble her (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) chin? Alack! what may that mean? Ye go beyond me,
mistress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis a resolute chin. Not a jot too resolute for this wicked world; but
when ye come to a Madonna? No thank you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well I never. A resolute chin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys. <div class="bookquote">``The darling!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now comes the rub. When you told me she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was--the way she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is, it
gave me a shock; I dropped my brushes. Was I going to turn a girl, that
couldn't keep her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover at a distance, into the Virgin Mary, at my time
of life? I love the poor ninny still. But I adore our blessed Lady.
Say you, `a painter must not be peevish in such matters'? Well, most
painters are men; and men are fine fellows. They can do aught. Their
saints and virgins are neither more nor less than their lemans, saving
your presence. But know that for this very reason half their craft
is lost on me, which find beneath their angels' white wings the very
trollops I have seen flaunting it on the streets, bejewelled like Paynim
idols, and put on like the queens in a pack o' cards. And I am not a
fine fellow, but only a woman, and my painting is but one half craft,
and t'other half devotion. So now you may read me. `Twas foolish,
maybe, but I could not help it; yet am I sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>And the old lady ended
despondently a discourse which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had commenced in a'mighty defiant
tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, dame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>observed Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``you must think it would go
to the poor girl's heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so fond of ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret Van Eyck only sighed.

<p/>The Frisian girl, after biting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips impatiently a little while,
turned upon Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Why, dame, think you `twas for that alone
Margaret and Peter hath left Sevenbergen? Nay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For what else, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What else? Why, because Gerard's people slight her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) so cruel. Who would

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Reicht, I was going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ay, going, and going, and going. Ye should ha' said less or else
done more. But with your words you did uplift her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heart and let it down
wi' your deeds. `They have never been,' said the poor thing to me, with
such a sigh. Ay, here is one can feel for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>): for I too am far from my
friends, and often, when first I came to Holland, I did used to take a
hearty cry all to myself. But ten times liever would I be Reicht Heynes
with nought but the leagues atw'een me and all my kith, than be as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
is i' the midst of them that ought to warm to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and yet to fare as
lonesome as I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack, Reicht, I did go but yestreen, and had gone before, but one
plaguy thing or t'other did still come and hinder me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mistress, did aught hinder ye to eat your dinner any one of those days?
I trow not. And had your heart been as good towards your own flesh and

comfort, wi' your child's child a beating `neath her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) bosom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Here this rude young woman was interrupted by an incident not uncommon
in a domestic's bright existence. The Van Eyck had been nettled by the
attack on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>), but with due tact had gone into ambush. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) now sprang
out of it. <div class="bookquote">``Since you disrespect my guests, seek another place!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht stoutly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>put in the good-natured Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``True folk will
still speak out. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) tongue is a stinger.''  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>Here the water came into
the speaker's eyes by way of confirmation. <div class="bookquote">``But better she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said it than
thought it. So now `t won't rankle in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). And part with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) for me,
that shall ye not. Beshrew the wench, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wots she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is a good servant,
and takes advantage. We poor wretches which keep house must still pay
`em tax for value. I had a good servant once, when I was a young
woman. Eh dear, how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did grind me down into the dust. In the end,
by Heaven's mercy, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) married the baker, and I was my own woman again.
`So,' said I, `no more good servants shall come hither, a hectoring o'
me.' I just get a fool and learn her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knoweth her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right
hand from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sauceth me: then out I bundle her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck and
crop, and take another dunce in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) place. Dear heart, `tis wearisome,
teaching a string of fools by ones; but there--I am mistress:''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>here she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was defending Reicht, and turning rather spitefully upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), added, <div class="bookquote">``and you be mistress here, I trow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more than that stool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said the Van Eyck loftily. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is neither
mistress nor servant; but Gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is dismissed the house, and there's
an end of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). What, did ye not hear me turn the saucy baggage off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay. We all heard ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht, with vast indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then hear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys solemnly.

<p/>They all went round like things on wheels, and fastened their eyes on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, let us hear what the man says,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hostess</b></font>)</div>urged the hostess. <div class="bookquote">``Men are fine
fellows, with their great hoarse voices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mistress Reicht,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, with great dignity and ceremony, indeed
so great as to verge on the absurd, <div class="bookquote">``you are turned off. If on a slight
acquaintance I might advise, I'd say, since you are a servant no more,
be a mistress, a queen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Easier said than done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>replied Reicht bluntly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a jot. You see here one who is a man, though but half an
arbalestrier, owing to that devilish Englishman's arrow, in whose
carcass I have, however, left a like token, which is a comfort. I have
twenty gold pieces''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) showed them-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``and a stout arm. In another
week or so I shall have twain. Marriage is not a habit of mine; but
I capitulate to so many virtues. You are beautiful, good-hearted, and
outspoken, and above all, you take the part of my she-comrade. Be then
an arbalestriesse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what the dickens is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired Reicht.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, be the wife, mistress, and queen of Denys of Burgundy here
present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A dead silence fell on all.

<p/>It did not last long, though; and was followed by a burst of
unreasonable indignation.

<p/>Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Well, did you ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Never in all my born days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Before our very faces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Of all the absurdity, and insolence of this ridiculous sex--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Denys observed somewhat drily, that the female to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had
addressed himself was mute; and the others, on whose eloquence there was
no immediate demand, were fluent: on this the voices stopped, and the
eyes turned pivot-like upon Reicht.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) took a sly glance from under her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) lashes at her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) military assailant,
and said, <div class="bookquote">``I mean to take a good look at any man ere I leap into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
arms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>assailant</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys drew himself up majestically. <div class="bookquote">``Then look your fill, and leap
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This proposal led to a new and most unexpected result. A long white
finger was extended by the Van Eyck in a line with the speaker's eye,
and an agitated voice bade him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) stand, in the name of all the saints.
<div class="bookquote">``You are beautiful, so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are inspired--with folly. What
matters that? you are inspired. I must take off your head.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And in a
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) was at work with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) pencil. <div class="bookquote">``Come out, hussy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) screamed
to Reicht, <div class="bookquote">``more in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and keep the fool inspired and
beautiful. Oh, why had I not this maniac for my good centurion? They
went and brought me a brute with a low forehead and a shapeless beard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine stood and looked with utter amazement at this pantomime,
and secretly resolved that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) venerable hostess had been a disguised
lunatic all this time, and was now busy throwing off the mask. As
for Reicht, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was unhappy and cross. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) caldron in a
precarious state, and made no scruple to say so, and that duties so
grave as hers left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) no <div class="bookquote">``time to waste a playing the statee and the
fool all at one time.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mistress in reply reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that it was
possible to be rude and rebellious to one's poor, old, affectionate,
desolate mistress, without being utterly heartless and savage; and a
trampler on arts.

<p/>On this Reicht stopped, and pouted, and looked like a little basilisk
at the inspired model who caused her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) woe. He (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) retorted with unshaken
admiration. The situation was at last dissolved by the artist's wrist
becoming cramped from disuse; this was not, however, until she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had made
a rough but noble sketch. <div class="bookquote">``I can work no more at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
sorrowfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, now, mistress, I may go and mind my pot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, go to your pot! And get into it, do; you will find your soul in
it: so then you will all be together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but, Reicht,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) turned you off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Boo, boo, boo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wants to get rid
of me, let her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) turn herself off and die. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is old enough
for't. But take your time, mistress; if you are in no hurry, no more am
I. When that day doth come, `twill take a man to dry my eyes; and if you
should be in the same mind then, soldier, you can say so; and if you are
not, why, `twill be all one to Reicht Heynes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>And the plain speaker went her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) way. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) words did not fall to the
ground. Neither of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) female hearers could disguise from herself that
this blunt girl, solitary herself, had probably read Margaret Brandt
aright, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had gone away from Sevenbergen broken-hearted.

<p/>Catherine and Denys bade the Van Eyck adieu, and that same afternoon
Denys set out on a wild goose chase. His (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) plan, like all great things,
was simple. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) should go to a hundred towns and villages, and ask in
each after an old physician with a fair daughter, and an old long-bow
soldier. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) should inquire of the burgomasters about all new-comers, and
should go to the fountains and watch the women and girls as they came
with their pitchers for water.

<p/>And away he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) went, and was months and months on the tramp, and could not
find her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).

<p/>Happily, this chivalrous feat of friendship was in some degree its own
reward.

<p/>Those who sit at home blindfolded by self-conceit, and think camel
or man out of the depths of their inner consciousness, alias their
ignorance, will tell you that in the intervals of war and danger, peace
and tranquil life acquire their true value and satisfy the heroic mind.
But those who look before they babble or scribble will see and say
that men who risk their lives habitually thirst for exciting pleasures
between the acts of danger, are not for innocent tranquility.

<p/>To this Denys was no exception. His (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) whole military life had been
half sparta, half Capua. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was too good a soldier and too good a
libertine to have ever mixed either habit with the other. But now for
the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) found himself mixed; at peace and yet on duty; for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) took this latter view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) wild goose chase, luckily. So all these
months he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was a demi-Spartan; sober, prudent, vigilant, indomitable; and
happy, though constantly disappointed, as might have been expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
flirted gigantically on the road; but wasted no time about it. Nor in
these his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) wanderings did he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) tell a single female that <div class="bookquote">``marriage was not
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) habits, etc.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a female</b></font>)</div><p/>And so we leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) on the tramp, <div class="bookquote">``Pilgrim of Friendship,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tramp</b></font>)</div>as his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) poor
comrade was of Love.



<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII

<p/>Catherine was in dismay when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reflected that Gerard must reach home
in another month at farthest, more likely in a week; and how should she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not even kept an eye upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) betrothed? Then there was
the uncertainty as to the girl's fate; and this uncertainty sometimes
took a sickening form.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) groaned, <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) should have gone and made herself
away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would never be so wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my lass, you know not what hasty fools young lasses be, that have
no mothers to keep `em straight. They will fling themselves into the
water for a man that the next man they meet would ha' cured `em of in a
week. I have known `em to jump in like brass one moment and scream for
help in the next. Couldn't know their own minds ye see even about such
a trifle as yon. And then there's times when their bodies ail like no
other living creatures ever I could hear of, and that strings up their
feelings so, the patience, that belongs to them at other times beyond
all living souls barring an ass, seems all to jump out of `em at
one turn, and into the water they go. Therefore, I say that men are
monsters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsters, and no less, to go making such heaps o' canals just to tempt
the poor women in. They know we shall not cut our throats, hating the
sight of blood and rating our skins a hantle higher nor our lives; and
as for hanging, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) is a fixing of the nail and a making of the
noose she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) has time t' alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) mind. But a jump into a canal is no more
than into bed; and the water it does all the lave, will ye, nill ye.
Why, look at me, the mother o' nine, wasn't I agog to make a hole in our
canal for the nonce?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, mother, I'll never believe it of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ye may, though. `Twas in the first year of our keeping house together.
Eli hadn't found out my weak stitches then, nor I his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>); so we made a
rent, pulling contrariwise; had a quarrel. So then I ran crying, to tell
some gabbling fool like myself what I had no business to tell out o'
doors except to the saints, and there was one of our precious canals in
the way; do they take us for teal? Oh, how tempting it did look! Says I
to myself, `Sith he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has let me go out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) door quarrelled, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) shall
see me drowned next, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) will change his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) key. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) will blubber
a good one, and I shall look down from heaven' -LRB-I forgot I should be in
t'other part-RRB-, `and see him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) take on, and oh, but that will be sweet!'
and I was all a tiptoe and going in, only just then I thought I
wouldn't. I had got a new gown a making, for one thing, and hard upon
finished. So I went home instead, and what was Eli's first word, `Let
yon flea stick i' the wall, my lass,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>). `Not a word of all I said
t' anger thee was sooth, but this, <div class="bookquote">``I love thee.''' These were his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) very
words; I minded `em, being the first quarrel. So I flung my arms about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) neck and sobbed a bit, and thought o' the canal; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) was no
colder to me than I to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>), being a man and a young one; and so then
that was better than lying in the water; and spoiling my wedding kirtle
and my fine new shoon, old John Bush made `em, that was uncle to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bush</b></font>)
keeps the shop now. And what was my grief to hers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Kate hoped that Margaret loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father too much to think of
leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) age. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bush</b></font>) is father and mother and all to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Kate, they do forget all these things in a moment o' despair when
the very sky seems black above them. I place more faith in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bush</b></font>) that
is unborn, than on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bush</b></font>) that is ripe for the grave, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) out o'
mischief. For certes it do go sore against us to die when there's a
little innocent a pulling at our hearts to let `un live, and feeding at
our very veins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, keep up a good heart, mother.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) added, that very likely
all these fears were exaggerated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ended by solemnly entreating her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
mother at all events not to persist in naming the sex of Margaret's
infant. It was so unlucky, all the gossips told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``dear heart, as if
there were not as many girls born as boys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>This reflection, though not unreasonable, was met with clamour.

<p/>``Have you the cruelty to threaten me with a girl!!? I want no more
girls, while I have you. What use would a lass be to me? Can I set her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)
on my knee and see my Gerard again as I can a boy? I tell thee `tis all
settled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How may that be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In my mind. And if I am to be disappointed i' the end, `tisn't for you
to disappoint me beforehand, telling me it is not to be a child, but
only a girl.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret Brandt/MARGARET BRANDT/Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLIX

<p/>MARGARET BRANDT had always held herself apart from Sevenbergen; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
reserve had passed for pride; this had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ears, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew
many hearts were swelling with jealousy and malevolence. How would they
triumph over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) condition could no longer be concealed! This
thought gnawed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) night and day. For some time it had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bury
herself in the house, and shun daylight even on those rare occasions
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went abroad.

<p/>Not that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) secret heart and conscience she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mistook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) moral
situation, as my unlearned readers have done perhaps. Though not
acquainted with the nice distinctions of the contemporary law, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew
that betrothal was a marriage contract, and could no more be legally
broken on either side than any other compact written and witnessed; and
that marriage with another party than the betrothed had been formerly
annulled both by Church and State and that betrothed couples often
came together without any further ceremony, and their children were
legitimate.

<p/>But what weighed down her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) simple mediaeval mind was this: that very
contract of betrothal was not forthcoming. Instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) keeping it,
Gerard had got it, and Gerard was far, far away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hated and despised
herself for the miserable oversight which had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) at the mercy of
false opinion.

<p/>For though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had never heard Horace's famous couplet, Segnius
irritant, etc., she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was Horatian by the plain, hard, positive
intelligence, which, strange to say, characterizes the judgment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
sex, when feeling happens not to blind it altogether. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gauged the
understanding of the world to a T. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) marriage lines being out
of sight, and in Italy, would never prevail to balance her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) visible
pregnancy, and the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) child when born. What sort of a tale was
this to stop slanderous tongues? <div class="bookquote">``I have got my marriage lines, but I
cannot show them you.''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>What woman would believe her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? or even pretend to
believe her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? And as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in reality one of the most modest girls in
Holland, it was women's good opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted, not men's.

<p/>Even barefaced slander attacks her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sex at a great advantage; but here
was slander with a face of truth. <div class="bookquote">``The strong-minded woman''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>had not yet
been invented; and Margaret, though by nature and by having been early
made mistress of a family, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was resolute in some respects, was weak
as water in others, and weakest of all in this. Like all the elite
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) sex, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was a poor little leaf, trembling at each gust of the
world's opinion, true or false. Much misery may be contained in few
words. I doubt if pages of description from any man's pen could make
any human creature, except virtuous women -LRB-and these need no such aid-RRB-,
realize the anguish of a virtuous woman foreseeing herself paraded as a
frail one. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) been frail at heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have brazened it out.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not that advantage. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was really pure as snow, and saw the
pitch coming nearer her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and nearer. The poor girl sat listless hours at
a time, and moaned with inner anguish. And often, when her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father was
talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) giving mechanical replies, suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cheek
would burn like fire, and the old man would wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said to
discompose her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Nothing. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words were less than air to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). It was the
ever-present dread sent the colour of shame into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) burning cheek, no
matter what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to be talking and thinking about. But both shame
and fear rose to a climax when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came back that night from Margaret
Van Eyck's. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) condition was discovered, and by persons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) own
sex. The old artist, secluded like herself, might not betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>);
but Catherine, a gossip in the centre of a family, and a thick
neighbourhood? One spark of hope remained. Catherine had spoken kindly,
even lovingly. The situation admitted no half course. Gerard's mother
thus roused must either be her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) best friend or worst enemy. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) waited
then in racking anxiety to hear more. No word came. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave up hope.
Catherine was not going to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no strong and kindly feeling to balance the natural love
of babbling.

<p/>Then it was the wish to fly from this neighbourhood began to grow and
gnaw upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), till it became a wild and passionate desire. But how
persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father to this? Old people cling to places. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very old
and infirm to change his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) abode. There was no course but to make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
confidant; better so than to run away from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt that would
be the alternative. And now between her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) uncontrollable desire to fly
and hide, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) invincible aversion to speak out to a man, even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) vibrated in a suspense full of lively torture. And presently
betwixt these two came in one day the fatal thought, <div class="bookquote">``end all!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Things
foolishly worded are not always foolish; one of poor Catherine's
bugbears, these numerous canals, did sorely tempt this poor fluctuating
girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood on the bank one afternoon, and eyed the calm deep water.
It seemed an image of repose, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so harassed. No more trouble.
No more fear of shame. If Gerard had not loved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), I doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
ended there.

<p/>As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kneeled by the water side, and prayed fervently to God to
keep such wicked thoughts from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh! selfish wretch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to
leave thy father. Oh, wicked wretch, to kill thy child, and make thy
poor Gerard lose all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pain and peril undertaken for thy sight. I will
tell father all, ay, ere this sun shall set.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went home with
eager haste, lest her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good resolution should ooze out ere she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) got there.

<p/>Now, in matters domestic the learned Peter was simple as a child, and
Margaret, from the age of sixteen, had governed the house gently
but absolutely. It was therefore a strange thing in this house, the
faltering, irresolute way in which its young but despotic mistress
addressed that person, who in a domestic sense was less important
than Martin Wittenhaagen, or even than the little girl who came in the
morning and for a pittance washed the vessels, etc., and went home at
night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, I would speak to thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak on, girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wilt listen to me? And--and--not--and try to excuse my faults?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have all our faults, Margaret, thou no more than the rest of us; but
fewer, unless parental feeling blinds me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, no, father: I am a poor foolish girl, that would fain do well,
but have done ill, most ill, most unwisely; and now must bear the shame.
But, father, I love you, with all my faults, and will not you forgive my
folly, and still love your motherless girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That ye may count on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Buyskens</b></font>)</div>said Peter cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, smile not. For then how can I speak and make you sad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, disgrace is coming on this house: it is at the door. And I
the culprit. Oh, father, turn your head away. I--I--father, I have let
Gerard take away my marriage lines.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all? `Twas an oversight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>```Twas the deed of a mad woman. But woe is me! that is not the worst.''

<p/>Peter interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The youth is honest, and loves you dear. You are
young. What is a year or two to you? Gerard will assuredly come back and
keep troth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And meantime know you what is coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I, except that I shall be gone first for one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse than that. There is worse pain than death. Nay, for pity's sake
turn away your head, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Foolish wench!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Buyskens</b></font>)</div>muttered Peter, but turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) head.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) trembled violently, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheeks on fire began to falter out,
<div class="bookquote">``I did look on Gerard as my husband--we being betrothed-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was in so
sore danger, and I thought I had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and I-oh, if you were but
my mother I might find courage: you would question me. But you say not a
word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Margaret, what is all this coil about? and why are thy cheeks
crimson, speaking to no stranger', but to thy old father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are my cheeks on fire? Because--because--father kill me; send me
to heaven! bid Martin shoot me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) arrow! And then the gossips will
come and tell you why I blush so this day. And then, when I am dead, I
hope you will love your girl again for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me thy hand, mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Buyskens</b></font>)</div>said Peter, a little sternly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put it out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) trembling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) took it gently and began with some
anxiety in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) face to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pulse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). ```Tis my soul that burns, not my body, with
fever. I cannot, will not, bide in Sevenbergen.'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands
impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be calm now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``nor torment thyself for
nought. Not bide in Sevenbergen? What need to bide a day, as it vexes
thee, and puts thee in a fever: for fevered thou art, deny it not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``would you yield to go hence, and--and ask no

knees beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in a fervour of supplication she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleeve,
and then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder, while imploring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to quit
this place, and not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) why. <div class="bookquote">``Alas! what needs it? You will soon see
it. And I could never say it. I would liever die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Foolish child, who seeks thy girlish secrets? Is it I, whose life hath

and wizard by those I heal? And give they not the guerdon and the honour
they deny me to the empirics that slaughter them? Besides, what is't to
me where we sojourn? Choose thou that, as did thy mother before thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tenderly, and wept upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was respited.

<p/>Yet as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wept, respited, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) almost wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had had the courage to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>After a while nothing would content him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) taking a medicament he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
went and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took it submissively, to please him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It
was the least she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could do. It was a composing draught, and though
administered under an error, and a common one, did her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) more good than
harm: she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) awoke calmed by a long sleep, and that very day began her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
preparations.

<p/>Next week they went to Rotterdam, bag and baggage, and lodged above a
tailor's shop in the Brede-Kirk Straet.

<p/>Only one person in Tergou knew whither they were gone.

<p/>The Burgomaster.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) locked the information in his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) own breast.

<p/>The use he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) made of it ere long, my reader will not easily divine: for he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
did not divine it himself.

<p/>But time will show.



<p/>CHAPTER L

<p/>Among strangers Margaret Brandt was comparatively happy. And soon a new
and unexpected cause of content arose. A civic dignitary being ill, and
fanciful in proportion, went from doctor to doctor; and having arrived
at death's door, sent for Peter. Peter found him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) bled and purged to
nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) flung a battalion of bottles out of window, and left it
open; beat up yolks of eggs in neat Schiedam, and administered it in
small doses; followed this up by meat stewed in red wine and water,
shredding into both mild febrifugal herbs, that did no harm. Finally,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) patient got about again, looking something between a man and a
pillow-case, and being a voluble dignitary, spread Peter's fame in every
street; and that artist, who had long merited a reputation in vain,
made one rapidly by luck. Things looked bright. The old man's pride was
cheered at last, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) purse began to fill. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spent much of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gain,
however, in sovereign herbs and choice drugs, and would have so invested
them all, but Margaret white-mailed a part. The victory came too late.
Its happy excitement was fatal.

<p/>One evening, in bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) good-night, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice seemed rather
inarticulate.

<p/>The next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was found speechless, and only just sensible.

<p/>Margaret, who had been for years her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father's attentive pupil, saw at
once that he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) had had a paralytic stroke. But not trusting to herself,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ran for a doctor. One of those who, obstructed by Peter, had not
killed the civic dignitary, came, and cheerfully confirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) views.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was for bleeding the patient. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) declined. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) was always against
blooding,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``especially the old.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Peter lived, but was never
the same man again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) memory became much affected, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
was not to be trusted to prescribe; and several patients had come,
and one or two, that were bent on being cured by the new doctor and no
other, awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) convalescence. Misery stared her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in the face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
resolved to go for advice and comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cousin William Johnson,
from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had hitherto kept aloof out of pride and poverty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
found him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) servant sitting in the same room, and neither of them
the better for liquor. Mastering all signs of surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
greetings, and presently told him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had come to talk on a family
matter, and with this glanced quietly at the servant by way of hint. The
woman took it, but not as expected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you can speak before me, can she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not, my old man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>At this familiarity Margaret turned very red, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cry you mercy, mistress. I knew not my cousin had fallen into the
custom of this town. Well, I must take a fitter opportunity;''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
rose to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wot not what ye mean by custom o' the town,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, bouncing
up. <div class="bookquote">``But this I know; `tis the part of a faithful servant to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
master from being preyed on by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) beggarly kin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret retorted: <div class="bookquote">``Ye are too modest, mistress. Ye are no servant. Your
speech betrays you. `Tis not till the ape hath mounted the tree that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), shows her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) tail so plain. Nay, there sits the servant; God help him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!
And while so it is, fear not thou his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kin will ever be so poor in spirit
as come where the likes of you can flout their dole.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>And casting one
look of mute reproach at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cousin for being so little of a man as to
sit passive and silent all this time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned and went haughtily out;
nor would she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) shed a single tear till she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) got home and thought of it.
And now here were two men to be lodged and fed by one pregnant girl; and
another mouth coming into the world.

<p/>But this last, though the most helpless of all, was their best friend.

<p/>Nature was strong in Margaret Brandt; that same nature which makes the
brutes, the birds, and the insects, so cunning at providing food and
shelter for their progeny yet to come.

<p/>Stimulated by nature she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat and brooded, and brooded, and thought, and
thought, how to be beforehand with destitution. Ay, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had still
five gold pieces left, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw starvation coming with inevitable foot.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sex, when, deviating from custom, it thinks with male intensity,
thinks just as much to the purpose as we do. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose, bade Martin move
Peter to another room, made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own very neat and clean, polished the
glass globe, and suspended it from the ceiling, dusted the crocodile and
nailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to the outside wall; and after duly instructing Martin, set
him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to play the lounging sentinel about the street door, and tell the
crocodile-bitten that a great, and aged, and learned alchymist abode
there, who in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) moments of recreation would sometimes amuse himself by
curing mortal diseases.

<p/>Patients soon came, and were received by Margaret, and demanded to see
the leech. <div class="bookquote">``That might not be. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) studies, searching for
the grand elixir, and not princes could have speech of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). They must
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) their symptoms, and return in two hours.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And oh! mysterious
powers! when they did return, the drug or draught was always ready for
them. Sometimes, when it was a worshipful patient, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would carefully
scan his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) face, and feeling both pulse and skin, as well as hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
story, would go softly with it to Peter's room; and there think and
ask herself how her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father, whose system she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had long quietly observed,
would have treated the case. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would write an illegible scrawl
with a cabalistic letter, and bring it down reverently, and show it the
patient, and <div class="bookquote">``Could he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) read that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div>Then it would be either, <div class="bookquote">``I am no
reader,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or, with admiration, <div class="bookquote">``Nay, mistress, nought can I make on't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but I can. `Tis sovereign. Look on thyself as cured!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
the materials by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was too good an economist not to favour
somewhat those medicines she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own stock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would sometimes
let the patient see her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) compound it, often and anxiously consulting the
sacred prescription lest great Science should suffer in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands. And
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would send them away relieved of cash, but with their pockets
full of medicine, and minds full of faith, and humbugged to their
hearts' content. Populus vult decipi. And when they were gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would
take down two little boxes Gerard had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); and on one of these
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had written To-day, and on the other To-morrow, and put the smaller
coins into <div class="bookquote">``To-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and the larger into <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>along with such
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gold pieces as had survived the journey from Sevenbergen, and
the expenses of housekeeping in a strange place, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) met current
expenses, and laid by for the rainy day she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw coming, and mixed drugs
with simples, and vice with virtue. On this last score her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) conscience
pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sore, and after each day's comedy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knelt down and prayed
God to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) child.''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>But lo and behold, cure
and cure was reported to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); so then her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) conscience began to harden.
Martin Wittenhaagen had of late been a dead weight on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands. Like
most men who had endured great hardships, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) had stiffened rather
suddenly. But though less supple, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) was as strong as ever, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>)
own pace could have carried the doctor herself round Rotterdam city. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>)
carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) slops instead.

<p/>In this new business he (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) showed the qualities of a soldier: unreasoning
obedience, punctuality, accuracy, despatch, and drunkenness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) fell among <div class="bookquote">``good fellows;''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>the blackguards plied him (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) with Schiedam;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) babbled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) bragged.

<p/>Doctor Margaret had risen very high in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) estimation. All this
brandishing of a crocodile for a standard, and setting a dotard in
ambush, and getting rid of slops, and taking good money in exchange,
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) not as Science but something far superior, Strategy. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>)
boasted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) cups and before a mixed company how <div class="bookquote">``me and my General we
are a biting of the burghers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When this revelation had had time to leaven the city, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) General,
Doctor Margaret, received a call from the constables; they took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>),
trembling and begging subordinate machines to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), before the
burgomaster; and by his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) side stood real physicians, a terrible row, in
long robes and square caps, accusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) of practising unlawfully on the
bodies of the duke's lieges. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was too frightened to say
a word. Novice like, the very name of <div class="bookquote">``Law''  (<font color='red'><b>Novice</b></font>)</div>paralyzed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). But being
questioned closely, but not so harshly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had been ugly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) told
the truth; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had long been her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father's pupil, and had but followed
his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) system, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had cured many; <div class="bookquote">``and it is not for myself in very
deed, sirs, but I have two poor helpless honest men at home upon my
hands, and how else can I keep them? Ah, good sirs, let a poor girl make
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bread honestly; ye hinder them not to make it idly and shamefully;
and oh, sirs, ye are husbands, ye are fathers; ye cannot but see I have
reason to work and provide as best I may;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and ere this woman's appeal
had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lips, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would have given the world to recall it, and
stood with one hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heart and one before her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face, hiding it,
but not the tears that trickled underneath it. All which went to the
wrong address. Perhaps a female bailiff might have yielded to such
arguments, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) practise medicine, and break law, till such time
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) child should be weaned, and no longer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have we to do with that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the burgomaster</b></font>)</div>said the burgomaster, <div class="bookquote">``save and except
that if thou wilt pledge thyself to break the law no more, I will remit
the imprisonment, and exact but the fine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the burgomaster</b></font>)</div><p/>On this Doctor Margaret clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands together, and vowed most
penitently never, never, never to cure body or beast again; and being
dismissed with the constables to pay the fine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned at the
door, and curtsied, poor soul, and thanked the gentlemen for their
forbearance.

<p/>And to pay the fine the <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow box''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>must be opened on the instant;
and with excess of caution she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had gone and nailed it up, that no slight
temptation might prevail to open it. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not draw the
nails, and the constables grew impatient, and doubted its contents, and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Let us break it for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the constables</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would not let them. <div class="bookquote">``Ye will
break it worse than I shall.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took a hammer, and struck too
faintly, and lost all strength for a minute, and wept hysterically; and
at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) broke it, and a little cry bubbled from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) when it broke;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) paid the fine, and it took all her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) unlawful gains and two gold
pieces to boot; and when the men were gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) drew the broken pieces
of the box, and what little money they had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), all together on the
table, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms went round them, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) rich hair escaped, and fell
down all loose, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) forehead on the wreck, and sobbed,
<div class="bookquote">``My love's box it is broken, and my heart withal;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and so remained. And
Martin Wittenhaagen came in, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head, but sighed
out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wittenhaagen</b></font>) what had befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), ending, <div class="bookquote">``My love his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) box is broken,
and so mine heart is broken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>And Martin was not so sad as wroth. Some traitor had betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>). What
stony heart had told and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to this pass? Whoever it was should
feel his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) arrow's point. The curious attitude in which he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) must deliver
the shaft never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Idle chat! idle chat!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>moaned Margaret, without lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brow from
the table. <div class="bookquote">``When you have slain all the gossips in this town, can we eat
them? Tell me how to keep you all, or prithee hold thy peace, and let
the saints get leave to whisper me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div>Martin held his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) tongue, and cast
uneasy glances at his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) defeated General.

<p/>Towards evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) rose, and washed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face and did up her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hair,
and doggedly bade Martin take down the crocodile, and put out a basket
instead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can get up linen better than they seem to do it in this street,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and you must carry it in the basket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will I for thy sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>said the soldier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Martin! forgive me that I spake shrewishly to thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a male</b></font>)</div><p/>Even while they were talking came a male for advice. Margaret told it
the mayor had interfered and forbidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to sell drugs. <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I will gladly iron and starch your linen for you, and I will come
and fetch it from your house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are ye mad, young woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>the male</b></font>)</div>said the male. <div class="bookquote">``I come for a leech, and ye
proffer me a washerwoman;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and it went out in dudgeon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a stupid creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret sadly.

<p/>Presently came a female to tell the symptoms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sick child. Margaret
stopped it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are forbidden by the bailiff to sell drugs. But I will gladly wash,
iron, and starch your linen for you-and-I will come and fetch it from
your house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the female</b></font>)</div>said the female. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I have some smocks and ruffs foul.
Come for them; and when you are there, you can look at the boy;''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and it
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) where it lived, and when its husband would be out; yet it was
rather fond of its husband than not.

<p/>An introduction is an introduction. And two or three patients out of
all those who came and were denied medicine made Doctor Margaret their
washerwoman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Martin, you must help. I'll no more cats than can slay mice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mistress, the stomach is not awanting for't, but the headpiece, worst
luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I mean not the starching and ironing; that takes a woman and a
handy one. But the bare washing; a man can surely contrive that. Why, a
mule has wit enough in's head to do't with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoofs, an' ye could drive
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the tub. Come, off doublet, and try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am your man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>said the brave old soldier, stripping for the unwonted
toil. <div class="bookquote">``I'll risk my arm in soapsuds, an you will risk your glory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your glory and honour as a--washerwoman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gramercy! if you are man enough to bring me half-washed linen t' iron,
I am woman enough to fling't back i' the suds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>girl the</b></font>)</div><p/>And so the brave girl and the brave soldier worked with a will, and kept
the wolf from the door. More they could not do. Margaret had repaired
the <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow box,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) leaned over the glue, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tears mixed
with it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cemented her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) exiled lover's box with them, at which a
smile is allowable, but an intelligent smile tipped with pity, please,
and not the empty guffaw of the nineteenth-century-jackass, burlesquing
Bibles, and making fun of all things except fun. But when mended
it stood unreplenished. They kept the weekly rent paid, and the pot
boiling, but no more.

<p/>And now came a concatenation. Recommended from one to another, Margaret
washed for the mayor. And bringing home the clean linen one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
heard in the kitchen that his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) worship's only daughter was stricken
with disease, and not like to live, Poor Margaret could not help
cross-questioning, and a female servant gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) such of the symptoms as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had observed. But they were too general. However, one gossip would
add one fact, and another another. And Margaret pondered them all.

<p/>At last one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) met the mayor himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) directly.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, you are the unlicensed doctor.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but now I'm
your worship's washerwoman.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The dignitary coloured, and said that was
rather a come down. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, I bear no malice; for your worship might have
been harder. Rather would I do you a good turn. Sir, you have a sick
daughter. Let me see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The mayor</b></font>)</div><p/>The mayor shook his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``That cannot be. The law I do enforce on
others I may not break myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>Margaret opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Alack, sir, I
seek no guerdon now for curing folk; why, I am a washerwoman. I trow one
may heal all the world, an if one will but let the world starve one in
return.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is no more than just,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mayor</b></font>)</div>said the mayor: he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``an' ye
make no trade on't, there is no offence.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then let me see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What avails it? The learnedest leeches in Rotterdam have all seen her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>),
and bettered her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) nought. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) ill is inscrutable. One skilled wight saith
spleen; another, liver; another, blood; another, stomach; and another,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is possessed; and in very truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) seems to have a demon;
shunneth all company; pineth alone; eateth no more victuals than might
diet a sparrow. Speaketh seldom, nor hearkens them that speak, and
weareth thinner and paler and nearer and nearer the grave, well-a-day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``an if you take your velvet doublet to
half-a-dozen of shops in Rotterdam, and speer is this fine or sorry
velvet, and worth how much the ell, those six traders will eye it and
feel it, and all be in one story to a letter. And why? Because they know
their trade. And your leeches are all in different stories. Why? Because
they know not their trade. I have heard my father say each is enamoured
of some one evil, and seeth it with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bat's eye in every patient. Had
they stayed at home, and never seen your daughter, they had answered all
the same, spleen, blood, stomach, lungs, liver, lunacy, or as they call
it possession. Let me see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). We are of a sex, and that is much.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>And
when he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) still hesitated, <div class="bookquote">``Saints of heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), giving way to
the irritability of a breeding woman, <div class="bookquote">``is this how men love their own
flesh and blood? Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother had ta’en me in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms ere this, and
carried me to the sick room.''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>And two violet eyes flashed fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mayor</b></font>)</div>said the mayor hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mistress, I have brought thee a new doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The person</b></font>)</div><p/>The person addressed, a pale young girl of eighteen, gave a contemptuous
wrench of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulder, and turned more decidedly to the fire she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
sitting over.

<p/>Margaret came softly and sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). ``But `tis one that will not
torment you.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the young lady, with surprise and some contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) your symptoms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for? you will be no wiser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be none the worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have no stomach for food, and no heart for any thing. Now cure
me, and go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Patience awhile! Your food, is it tasteless like in your mouth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay. How knew you that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I knew it not till you did tell me. I trow you would be better for
a little good company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I trow not. What is their silly chat to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Margaret requested the father to leave them alone; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
absence put some practical questions. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) reflected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you wake i' the morning you find yourself quiver, as one may say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay. Ay. How knew you that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I dose you, or shall I but tease you a bit with my silly chat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will tell you a story. `Tis about two true lovers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate to hear of lovers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl; <div class="bookquote">``nevertheless canst tell me,
`twill be less nauseous than your physic--maybe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret then told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) a love story. The maiden was a girl called Ursel,
and the youth one Conrad; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) an old physician's daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Conrad</b></font>) the son of
a hosier at Tergou. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) told their adventures, their troubles, their sad
condition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) told it from the female point of view, and in a sweet and
winning and earnest voice, that by degrees soon laid hold of this sullen
heart, and held it breathless; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) broke it off her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) patient was
much disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, I must hear the end. I will hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye cannot, for I know it not; none knoweth that but God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, your Ursel was a jewel of worth,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``Would
she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) were here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that is here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say not that;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blushed a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do but think it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thought is free. Whether or no, an she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) were here, I'd give her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a buss,
poor thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then give it me, for I am she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, that I'll be sworn y' are not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say not so; in very truth I am she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). And prithee, sweet mistress, go
not from your word, but give me the buss ye promised me, and with a good
heart, for oh, my own heart lies heavy: heavy as thine, sweet mistress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentlewoman</b></font>)</div><p/>The young gentlewoman rose and put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms round Margaret's neck and
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am woe for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``You are a good soul; you
have done me good--a little.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-A gulp came in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) throat.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Come again!
come again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret did come again, and talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and gently, but keenly
watched what topics interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and found there was but one.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said to the mayor, <div class="bookquote">``I know your daughter's trouble, and `tis
curable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mayor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is't? the blood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The stomach?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The liver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The foul fiend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Love? stuff, impossible! She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is but a child; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) never stirs abroad
unguarded. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) never hath from a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the better; then we shall not have far to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I vow not. I shall but command her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to tell me the caitiff's name, that
hath by magic arts ensnared her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) young affections.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how foolish be the wise!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``what, would ye go and put
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) guard? Nay, let us work by art first; and if that fails, then
`twill still be time for violence and folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret then with some difficulty prevailed on the mayor to take
advantage of its being Saturday, and pay all his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) people their salaries
in his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) daughter's presence and hers.

<p/>It was done: some fifteen people entered the room, and received their
pay with a kind word from their employer. Then Margaret, who had sat
close to the patient all the time, rose and went out. The mayor followed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, how call you yon black-haired lad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is Ulrich, my clerk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, `tis he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulrich</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now Heaven forbid a lad I took out of the streets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but your worship is an understanding man. You took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not up
without some merit of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Merit? not a jot! I liked the looks of the brat, that was all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that no merit? He (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) pleased the father's eye. And now who had pleased
the daughter's. That has oft been seen since Adam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How know ye `tis he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I held her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand, and with my finger did lightly touch her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wrist; and
when the others came and went, `twas as if dogs and cats had fared in
and out. But at this Ulrich's coming her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pulse did leap, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) eye
shine; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulrich</b></font>) went, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) did sink back and sigh; and `twas to be
seen the sun had gone out of the room for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). Nay, burgomaster, look
not on me so scared: no witch or magician I, but a poor girl that hath
been docile, and so bettered herself by a great neglected leech's art
and learning. I tell ye all this hath been done before, thousands of
years ere we were born. Now bide thou there till I come to thee, and
prithee, prithee, spoil not good work wi' meddling.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) then went back
and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) patient for a lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), more listlessly than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, `tis a lass of marble. How long do you count to be like that,
mistress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Till I am in my grave, sweet Peggy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who knows? maybe in ten minutes you will be altogether as hot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ran into the shop, but speedily returned to the mayor and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Good news! He (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) fancies her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) and more than a little. Now how is't to be?
Will you marry your child, or bury her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>), for there is no third way, for
shame and love they do rend her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) virgin heart to death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mayor</b></font>)</div><p/>The dignitary decided for the more cheerful rite, but not without a
struggle; and with its marks on his (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) accompanied Margaret to his (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>)
daughter. But as men are seldom in a hurry to drink their wormwood, he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>)
stood silent. So Doctor Margaret said cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``Mistress, your lock
is gone; I have sold it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who was so mad as to buy such a thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>inquired the young lady
scornfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a black-haired laddie wi' white teeth. They call him (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) Ulrich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The pale face reddened directly, brow and all.

<p/>``Says he (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>), `Oh, sweet mistress, give it me.' I had told them all whose
`twas. `Nay,' said I, `selling is my livelihood, not giving.' So he (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)
offered me this, he (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) offered me that, but nought less would I take than
his (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) next quarter's wages.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cruel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>murmured the girl, scarce audibly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you are in one tale with your father. Says he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to me when I told
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), `Oh, an he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hair so well, `tis odd but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loves the rest
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). Well,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), `'tis an honest lad, and a shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), gien
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) will but leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) sulks and consent.' So, what say ye, mistress,
will you be married to Ulrich, or buried i' the kirkyard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father! father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis so, girl, speak thy mind.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will obey my father--in all things,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>stammered the poor girl, trying
hard to maintain the advantageous position in which Margaret had placed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). But nature, and the joy and surprise, were too strong even for a
virgin's bashful cunning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cast an eloquent look on them both, and
sank at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father's knees, and begged his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pardon, with many sobs for
having doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tenderness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), radiant through her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tears with
joy, and returning life, and filial love, to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) breast; and the pair
passed a truly sacred moment, and the dignitary was as happy as he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>)
thought to be miserable; so hard is it for mortals to foresee. And they
looked round for Margaret, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had stolen away softly.

<p/>The young girl searched the house for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hid? Where on earth is she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Where was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? why, in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own house, dressing meat for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) two old
children, and crying bitterly the while at the living picture of
happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had just created.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well-a-day, the odds between her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) lot and mine; well-a-day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Next time she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) met the dignitary he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) hemm'd and hawed, and remarked what
a pity it was the law forbade him (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) who had cured his (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) daughter.
<div class="bookquote">``However, when all is done, `twas not art, `twas but woman's wit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nought but that, burgomaster,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Pay the men of
art for not curing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): all the guerdon I seek, that cured her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), is this:
go not and give your foul linen away from me by way of thanks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>inquired he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry, because there be fools about ye will tell ye she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that hath wit
to cure dark diseases, cannot have wit to take dirt out o' rags; so
pledge me your faith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The dignitary</b></font>)</div><p/>The dignitary promised pompously, and felt all the patron.


<p/>Something must be done to fill <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow's''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>box. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hawked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) initial
letters and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) illuminated vellums all about the town. Printing had by
this time dealt caligraphy in black and white a terrible blow in
Holland and Germany. But some copies of the printed books were usually
illuminated and fettered. The printers offered Margaret prices for work
in these two kinds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll think on't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took down her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) diurnal book, and calculated that the price of an
hour's work on those arts would be about one-fifth what she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) got for an
hour at the tub and mangle. <div class="bookquote">``I'll starve first,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``what, pay a
craft and a mystery five times less than a handicraft!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin, carrying the dry clothes-basket, got treated, and drunk. This
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) babbled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) whole story. The girls got hold of it and gibed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
at the fountain.

<p/>All she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had gone through was light to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), compared with the pins and
bodkins her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own sex drove into her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heart, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came near the
merry crew with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pitcher, and that was every day. Each sex has its
form of cruelty; man's is more brutal and terrible; but shallow women,
that have neither read nor suffered, have an unmuscular barbarity of
their own -LRB-where no feeling of sex steps in to overpower it-RRB-. This
defect, intellectual perhaps rather than moral, has been mitigated in
our day by books, especially by able works of fiction; for there are
two roads to the highest effort of intelligence, Pity; Experience of
sorrows, and Imagination, by which alone we realize the grief we
never felt. In the fifteenth century girls with pitchers had but one;
Experience; and at sixteen years of age or so, that road had scarce been
trodden. These girls persisted that Margaret was deserted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lover.
And to be deserted was a crime -LRB-They had not been deserted yet.-RRB- Not a
word against the Gerard they had created out of their own heads. For the
imaginary crime they fell foul of the supposed victim. Sometimes they
affronted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face. Oftener they talked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) backwards and
forwards with a subtle skill, and a perseverance which, <div class="bookquote">``oh, that they
had bestowed on the arts,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as poor Aguecheek says.

<p/>Now Margaret was brave, and a coward; brave to battle difficulties and
ill fortune; brave to shed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own blood for those she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) loved. Fortitude
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had no true fighting courage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was a powerful young
woman, rather tall, full, and symmetrical; yet had one of those slips
of girls slapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face, the poor fool's hands would have dropped
powerless, or gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own eyes instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) adversary's. Nor was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) even a match for so many tongues; and besides, what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) say?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew nothing of these girls, except that somehow they had found out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sorrows, and hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); only she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thought to herself they must be
very happy, or they would not be so hard on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took their taunts in silence; and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) struggle was not to let
them see their power to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) writhe within.

<p/>Here came in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fortitude; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) received their blows with
well-feigned, icy hauteur. They slapped a statue.

<p/>But one day, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) spirits were weak, as happens at times to females
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) condition, a dozen assailants followed suit so admirably, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) whole sex seemed to the dispirited one to be against her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
lost heart, and the tears began to run silently at each fresh stab.

<p/>On this their triumph knew no bounds, and they followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) half way
home casting barbed speeches.

<p/>After that exposure of weakness the statue could be assumed no more. So
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would stand timidly aloof out of tongue-shot, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) young
tyrants' pitchers were all filled, and they gone; and then creep up with
hers. And one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) waited so long that the fount had ceased to flow.
So the next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was obliged to face the phalanx, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) house go
dry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) drew near slowly, but with the less tremor, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw a
man at the well talking to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would distract their attention, and
besides, they would keep their foul tongues quiet if only to blind
the male to their real character. This conjecture, though shrewd, was
erroneous. They could not all flirt with that one man; so the outsiders
indemnified themselves by talking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) the very moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Any news from foreign parts, Jacqueline?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None for me, Martha. My lad goes no farther from me than the town
wall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say as much,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says a third.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'ll not go thither, lass. They go not so far till they are sick of us

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>Surprise and indignation, and the presence of a man, gave Margaret a
moment's fighting courage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, flout me not, and show your ill nature before the very soldier. In
Heaven's name, what ill did I ever to ye? what harsh word cast back, for

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They stared at this novelty, resistance; and ere they could recover and
make mincement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pitcher quietly down, and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
coarse apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head, and stood there grieving, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) short-lived
spirit oozing fast. <div class="bookquote">``Hallo!''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>cried the soldier, <div class="bookquote">``why, what is your ill?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) made no reply. But a little girl, who had long secretly hated the
big ones, squeaked out, <div class="bookquote">``They did flout her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), they are aye flouting her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>);

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I. I would not bemean myself so far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man laughed heartily at this display of dignity. <div class="bookquote">``Come, wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``never lower thy flag to such light skirmishers as these. Hast a

murmured, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you kindly, brave soldier.''

pretended to shoot them all dead: they fled quadrivious, shrieking.



<p/>CHAPTER LI

<p/>The reader already knows how much these two had to tell one another.
It was a sweet yet bitter day for Margaret, since it brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) a true
friend, and ill news; for now first she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) learned that Gerard was all
alone in that strange land. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not think with Denys that he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) would
come home; indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) would have arrived before this.

<p/>Denys was a balm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) she-comrade, and was always cheering
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) formula and hilarities, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) petted him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) and made
much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), and feebly hectored it over him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) as well as over Martin, and
would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) eat a single meal out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) house, and forbade him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to
use naughty words. <div class="bookquote">``It spoils you, Denys. Good lack, to hear such ugly
words come forth so comely a head: forbear, or I shall be angry: so be
civil.''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>Whereupon Denys was upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) good behaviour, and ludicrous the
struggle between his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) native politeness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) acquired ruffianism. And
as it never rains but it pours, other persons now solicited Margaret's
friendship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had written to Margaret Van Eyck a humble letter telling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) was no longer the favourite she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) had been, and would
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) distance; but could not forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) benefactress's past
kindness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) then told her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) briefly how many ways she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) had battled for a
living, and in conclusion, begged earnestly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) residence might not
be betrayed, <div class="bookquote">``least of all to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) people. I do hate them, they drove
him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) from me. And even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was gone, their hearts turned not to me as
they would an if they had repented their cruelty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Van Eyck was perplexed. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) made a confidante of Reicht. The
secret ran through Reicht, as through a cylinder, to Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, and is she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) turned that bitter against us?''  (<font color='red'><b>that woman</b></font>)</div>said that good woman.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stole our son from us, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hates us for not running into
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arms. Natheless it is a blessing she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is alive and no farther away
than Rotterdam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The English princess Charolois</b></font>)</div><p/>The English princess, now Countess Charolois, made a stately
progress through the northern states of the duchy, accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
stepdaughter the young heiress of Burgundy, Marie de Bourgogne. Then the
old duke, the most magnificent prince in Europe, put out his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) splendour.
Troops of dazzling knights, and bevies of fair ladies gorgeously
attired, attended the two princesses; and minstrels, jongleurs, or
story-tellers, bards, musicians, actors, tumblers followed in the train;
and there was fencing, dancing, and joy in every town they shone on.
Richart invited all his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) people to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) at Rotterdam and view the
pageant.

<p/>They had been in Rotterdam some days, when Denys met Catherine
accidentally in the street, and after a warm greeting on both sides,
bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rejoice, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had found the she-comrade, and crowed; but
Catherine cooled him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) by showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) how much earlier he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) would have found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by staying quietly at Tergou, than by vagabondizing it all over
Holland. <div class="bookquote">``And being found, what the better are we? her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heart is set dead
against us now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, let that flea stick; come you with me to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would not go where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was sure of an ill welcome. <div class="bookquote">``Them that
come unbidden sit unseated.''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>No, let Denys be mediator, and bring the
parties to a good understanding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) undertook the office at once, and
with great pomp and confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) trotted off to Margaret and said,
<div class="bookquote">``She-comrade, I met this day a friend of thine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou didst look into the Rotter then, and see thyself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, `twas a female, and one that seeks thy regard; `twas Catherine,
Gerard's mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``then you may tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) comes too late.
There was a time I longed and longed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) held aloof in my
hour of most need, so now we will be as we ha' been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys tried to shake this resolution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) coaxed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was bitter
and sullen, and not to be coaxed. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) well; then, at
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went into hysterics.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was frightened at this result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) eloquence, and being off his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
guard, allowed himself to be entrapped into a solemn promise never to
recur to the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) went back to Catherine crestfallen, and
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fired up and told the family how his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) overtures had been
received. Then they fired up; it became a feud and burned fiercer every
day. Little Kate alone made some excuses for Margaret.

<p/>The very next day another visitor came to Margaret, and found the
military enslaved and degraded, Martin up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) elbows in soapsuds,
and Denys ironing very clumsily, and Margaret plaiting ruffs, but with
a mistress's eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) raw levies. To these there entered an old man,
venerable at first sight, but on nearer view keen and wizened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret. Then swiftly turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) back on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
face with invincible repugnance. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, that man! that man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, fear me not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>said Ghysbrecht; <div class="bookquote">``I come on a friend's errand. I
bring ye a letter from foreign parts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mock me not, old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned slowly round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, see;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) held out an enormous letter.

<p/>Margaret darted on it, and held it with trembling hands and glistening
eyes. It was Gerard's handwriting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you, sir, bless you for this, I forgive you all the ill you
ever wrought me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pressed the letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bosom with one hand, and glided
swiftly from the room with it.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not come back, Ghysbrecht went away, but not without a scowl
at Martha. Margaret was hours alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) letter.



<p/>CHAPTER LI

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came down again she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was a changed woman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes were wet, but
calm, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bitterness and excitement charmed away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Denys,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) softly, <div class="bookquote">``I have got my orders. I am to read my lover's
letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) folk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye will never do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay will I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see there is something in the letter has softened ye towards them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a jot, Denys, not a jot. But an I hated them like poison I would
not disobey my love. Denys, `tis so sweet to obey, and sweetest of all
to obey one who is far, far away, and cannot enforce my duty, but must
trust my love for my obedience. Ah, Gerard, my darling, at hand I might
have slighted thy commands, misliking thy folk as I have cause to do;
but now, didst bid me go into the raging sea and read thy sweet letter
to the sharks, there I'd go. Therefore, Denys, tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) mother I have
got a letter, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and hers would hear it, I am their servant; let
them say their hour, and I'll seat them as best I can, and welcome them
as best I may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys went off to Catherine with this good news. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) found the family at
dinner, and told them there was a long letter from Gerard. Then in the
midst of the joy this caused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``And her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart is softened, and

 (<font color='red'><b>Cornelis</b></font>)</div><p/>Cornelis suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would fain wedge herself into the family by
means of this letter.

<p/>Denys cast a look of scorn on the speaker. <div class="bookquote">``There spoke a bad heart,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``La camarade hates you all like poison. Oh, mistake me not,

 (<font color='red'><b>soldier</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis so, mine honest soldier,'' said the father of the family, <div class="bookquote">``and

 (<font color='red'><b>soldier</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, and a man who is better than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``the only

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold thy peace, wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Art a man of sense, Eli, a dirk, a chose, a chose-LRB-1-RRB-,''' shouted Denys.
<div class="bookquote">``The she-comrade will be right glad to obey Gerard and yet not face you
all, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hates as wormwood, saving your presence. Bless ye, the
world hath changed, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is all submission to-day: `obedience is honey,'
quoth she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and in sooth `tis a sweetmeat she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cannot but savour, eating
so little on't, for what with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fair face, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mellow tongue; and
what wi' flying in fits and terrifying us that be soldiers to death, an
we thwart her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and what wi' chiding us one while, and petting us like
lambs t' other, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hath made two of the crawlingest slaves ever you
saw out of two honest swashbucklers. I be the ironing ruffian, t' other

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``What next?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What next? why, whenever the brat is in the world I shall rock cradle,

not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Else our hearts were black as coal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/>So Denys went for the letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) came back crestfallen. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will not

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cornelis</b></font>)</div>said Cornelis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whisht! whisht!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli, <div class="bookquote">``and let Denys tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>```Nay,' said I, `but be ruled by me.' `Not I,' quoth she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). `Well, but,'
quoth I, `that same honey Obedience ye spake of.' `You are a fool,' says
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); `obedience to Gerard is sweet, but obedience to any other body, who
ever said that was sweet?'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At last she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seemed to soften a bit, and did give me a written paper for
you, mademoiselle. Here `tis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said little Kate, colouring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give that here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) scanned the writing, and said almost
in a whisper, ``These be words from the letter Hearken!

<p/>```And, sweetheart, an if these lines should travel safe to thee, make
thou trial of my people's hearts withal. Maybe they are somewhat turned
towards me, being far away. If `tis so they will show it to thee, since
now to me they may not. Read, then, this letter! But I do strictly
forbid thee to let it from thy hand; and if they still hold aloof from
thee, why, then say nought, but let them think me dead. Obey me in
this; for, if thou dost disrespect my judgment and my will in this, thou
lovest me not.'''

<p/>There was a silence, and Gerard's words copied by Margaret here handed
round and inspected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``that is another matter. But methinks `tis for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to come to us, not we to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, mother! what odds does that make?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli. <div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) we are over many to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and bid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
hither, the sooner the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>When Denys was gone, Eli owned it was a bitter pill to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When that lass shall cross my threshold, all the mischief and misery
she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) hath made here will seem to come in adoors in one heap. But what
could I do, wife? We must hear the news of Gerard. I saw that in thine
eyes, and felt it in my own heart. And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is backed by our undutiful
but still beloved son, and so is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stronger than we, and brings our
noses down to the grindstone, the sly, cruel jade. But never heed.
We will hear the letter; and then let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) go unblessed as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came
unwelcome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make your mind easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will not come at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And a
tone of regret was visible.

<p/>Shortly after Richart, who had been hourly expected, arrived from
Amsterdam grave and dignified in his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) burgher's robe and gold chain,
ruff, and furred cap, and was received not with affection only, but
respect; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) had risen a step higher than his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) parents, and such steps
were marked in mediaeval society almost as visibly as those in their
staircases.

<p/>Admitted in due course to the family council, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) showed plainly, though
not discourteously, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) pride was deeply wounded by their having
deigned to treat with Margaret Brandt. <div class="bookquote">``I see the temptation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``But which of us hath not at times to wish one way and do another?''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>This
threw a considerable chill over the old people. So little Kate put in a
word. ``Vex not thyself, dear Richart. Mother says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) will not come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the better, sweetheart. I fear me, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) do, I shall hie me back
to Amsterdam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Denys popped his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) head in at the door, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) will be here at three on the great dial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>They all looked at one another in silence.

<p/>-LRB-1-RRB- Anglice, a Thing-em-bob.


<p/>CHAPTER LIII

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Richart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine at last, <div class="bookquote">``for Heaven's sake let not this
one sorry wench set us all by the ears: hath she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) not made ill blood
enough already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In very deed she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) hath. Fear me not, good mother. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) come and read
the letter of the poor boy she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) hath by devilish arts bewitched and then
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) go. Give me your words to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) no countenance beyond decent
and constrained civility: less we may not, being in our own house; and
I will say no more.''  (<font color='red'><b>the foe</b></font>)</div>On this understanding they waited the foe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) part, prepared for the interview in a spirit little less hostile.
When Denys brought word they would not come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), but would receive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lip curled, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) observe how in them every feeling,
however small, was larger than the love for Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I
have not that excuse; so why mimic the pretty burgher's pride, the pride
of all unlettered folk? I will go to them for Gerard's sake. Oh, how I
loathe them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus poor good-natured Denys was bringing into one house the materials
of an explosion.

<p/>Margaret made her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) toilet in the same spirit that a knight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) day
dressed for battle--he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to parry blows, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to parry glances--glances
of contempt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) poverty, or of irony at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) extravagance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) kirtle
was of English cloth, dark blue, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) farthingale and hose of the
same material, but a glossy roan, or claret colour. Not an inch of
pretentious fur about her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), but plain snowy linen wristbands, and
curiously plaited linen from the bosom of the kirtle up to the
commencement of the throat; it did not encircle her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) throat, but framed
it, being square, not round. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) front hair still peeped in two waves
much after the fashion which Mary Queen of Scots revived a century
later; but instead of the silver net, which would have ill become her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
present condition, the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head was covered with a very small
tight-fitting hood of dark blue cloth, hemmed with silver. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) shoes
were red; but the roan petticoat and hose prepared the spectator's mind
for the shock, and they set off the arched instep and shapely foot.

<p/>Beauty knew its business then as now.

<p/>And with all this she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) enemies waiting, though it was three by
the dial.

<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) started, attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) he-comrade. And when they were
halfway, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) stopped and said thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``Denys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she-general?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go home''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-piteously-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, have ye left somewhat behind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My courage. Oh! oh! oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, be brave, she-general. I shall be with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but wilt keep close to me when I be there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys promised, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) march, but gingerly.

<p/>Meantime they were all assembled, and waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) with a strange
mixture of feelings.

<p/>Mortification, curiosity, panting affection, aversion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) who came to
gratify those feelings, yet another curiosity to see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was like,
and what there was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) to bewitch Gerard and make so much mischief.

<p/>At last Denys came alone, and whispered, <div class="bookquote">``The she-comrade is without.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli. <div class="bookquote">``Now whisht, all of ye. None speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) but
I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They all turned their eyes to the door in dead silence.

<p/>A little muttering was heard outside; Denys's rough organ and a woman's
soft and mellow voice.

<p/>Presently that stopped; and then the door opened slowly, and Margaret
Brandt, dressed as I have described, and somewhat pale, but calm and
lovely, stood on the threshold, looking straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>They all rose but Kate, and remained mute and staring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be seated, mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli gravely, and motioned to a seat that had
been set apart for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) head, and crossed the apartment; and in so doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
condition was very visible, not only in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) shape, but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) languor.

<p/>Cornelis and Sybrandt hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) for it. Richart thought it spoiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
beauty.

<p/>It softened the women somewhat.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) letter out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) bosom, and kissed it as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had been
alone; then disposed herself to read it, with the air of one who knew
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was there for that single purpose.

<p/>But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) began, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) noticed they had seated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) all by herself like a
leper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) looked at Denys, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hand down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) side, made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) a swift furtive motion to come by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) went with an obedient start as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had cried <div class="bookquote">``March!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and stood
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) shoulder like a sentinel; but this zealous manner of doing it
revealed to the company that he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had been ordered thither; and at that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) coloured. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) began to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) Gerard, their Gerard, to
their eager ears, in a mellow, clear voice, so soft, so earnest, so
thrilling, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) very soul seemed to cling about each precious sound. It
was a voice as of a woman's bosom set speaking by Heaven itself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do nothing doubt, my Margaret, that long ere this shall meet thy
beloved eyes, Denys, my most dear friend, will have sought thee out,
and told thee the manner of our unlooked for and most tearful parting.
Therefore I will e'en begin at that most doleful day. What befell him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
after, poor faithful soul, fain, fain would I hear, but may not. But I
pray for him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) day and night next after thee, dearest. Friend more stanch
and loving had not David in Jonathan, than I in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>). Be good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>), for
poor Gerard's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words, which came quite unexpectedly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), Denys leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
head on Margaret's high chair, and groaned aloud.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned quickly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sat, and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hand, and pressed it.

<p/>And so the sweetheart and the friend held hands while the sweetheart
read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went forward all dizzied, like one in an ill dream; and presently a
gentleman came up with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) servants, all on horseback, and had liked to
have rid o’er me. And he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) drew rein at the brow of the hill, and sent
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) armed men back to rob me. They robbed me civilly enough and took my
purse and the last copper, and rid gaily away. I wandered stupid on, a
friendless pauper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a general sigh, followed by an oath from Denys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Presently a strange dimness came o’er me; I lay down to sleep on the
snow. `Twas ill done, and with store of wolves hard by. Had I loved thee
as thou dost deserve, I had shown more manhood. But oh, sweet love, the
drowsiness that did crawl o’er me desolate, and benumb me, was more than
nature. And so I slept; and but that God was better to us, than I to
thee or to myself, from that sleep I ne’er had waked; so all do say.
I had slept an hour or two, as I suppose, but no more, when a hand did
shake me rudely. I awoke to my troubles. And there stood a servant girl
in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) holiday suit. `Are ye mad,' quoth she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), in seeming choler, `to
sleep in snow, and under wolves' nosen? Art weary o' life, and not long
weaned? Come, now, said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), more kindly, `get up like a good lad;' so
I did rise up. `Are ye rich, or are ye poor?' But I stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as one
amazed. `Why, `tis easy of reply,' quoth she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). `Are ye rich, or are ye
poor?' Then I gave a great, loud cry; that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did start back. `Am I
rich, or am I poor? Had ye asked me an hour agone, I had said I am rich.
But now I am so poor as sure earth beareth on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bosom none poorer.
An hour agone I was rich in a friend, rich in money, rich in hope and
spirits of youth; but now the Bastard of Burgundy hath taken my friend,
and another gentleman my purse; and I can neither go forward to Rome nor
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) I left in Holland. I am poorest of the poor.' `Alack!' said
the wench. `Natheless, an ye had been rich ye might ha' lain down again
in the snow for any use I had for ye; and then I trow ye had soon fared
out o' this world as bare as ye came into it. But, being poor, you are
our man: so come wi' me.' Then I went because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bade me, and because I
recked not now whither I went. And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took me to a fine house hard by,
and into a noble dining-hall hung with black; and there was set a table
with many dishes, and but one plate and one chair. `Fall to!' said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
in a whisper. `What, alone?' said I. `Alone? And which of us, think ye,
would eat out of the same dish with ye? Are we robbers o' the dead?'
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) speered where I was born. `At Tergou,' said I. Says she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), `And
when a gentleman dies in that country, serve they not the dead man's
dinner up as usual, till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be in the ground, and set some poor man to
it?' I told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), `nay.' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blushed for us then. Here they were better
Christians.' So I behoved to sit down. But small was my heart for meat.
Then this kind lass sat by me and poured me out wine; and tasting it,
it cut me to the heart Denys was not there to drink with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) doth so
love good wine, and women good, bad, or indifferent. The rich, strong
wine curled round my sick heart; and that day first I did seem to
glimpse why folk in trouble run to drink so. She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) made me eat of every
dish. `'Twas unlucky to pass one. Nought was here but her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) master's daily
dinner.' `He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had a good stomach, then,' said I. `Ay, lad, and a good
heart. Leastways, so we all say now he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is dead; but, being alive, no
word on't e'er heard I.' So I did eat as a bird, nibbling of every dish.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) hearing me sigh, and seeing me like to choke at the food, took
pity and bade me be of good cheer. I should sup and lie there that
night. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) went to the hind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) gave me a right good bed; and I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) all, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would the law give me back my purse. `Law!'
quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>); `law there was none for the poor in Burgundy. Why, `twas the
cousin of the Lady of the Manor, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) that had robbed me. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) knew the
wild spark. The matter must be judged before the lady; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was quite
young, and far more like to hang me for slandering her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cousin, and a
gentleman, and a handsome man, than to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) give me back my own.
Inside the liberties of a town a poor man might now and then see the
face of justice; but out among the grand seigneurs and dames--never.'
So I said, `I'll sit down robbed rather than seek justice and find
gallows.' They were all most kind to me next day; and the girl proffered
me money from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) small wage to help me towards Rhine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is coming home! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is coming home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>shouted Denys,
interrupting the reader. She (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) head gently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), by way of
reproof.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg pardon, all the company,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) stiffly.

<p/>```Twas a sore temptation; but being a servant, my stomach rose against
it. `Nay, nay,' said I. She (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) told me I was wrong. `'Twas pride out o'
place; poor folk should help one another; or who on earth would?' I said
if I could do aught in return `twere well; but for a free gift, nay: I
was overmuch beholden already. Should I write a letter for her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>)? `Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
is in the house at present,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>). `Should I draw her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) picture, and
so earn my money?' `What, can ye?' said she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>). I told her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) I could try; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) habit would well become a picture. So she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) was agog to be limned, and
give it her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) lad. And I set her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) to stand in a good light, and soon made
sketches two, whereof I send thee one, coloured at odd hours. The other
I did most hastily, and with little conscience daub, for which may
Heaven forgive me; but time was short. They, poor things, knew no
better, and were most proud and joyous; and both kissing me after their
country fashion, `twas the hind that was her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) sweetheart, they did bid me
God-speed; and I towards Rhine.''

<p/>Margaret paused here, and gave Denys the coloured drawing to hand round.
It was eagerly examined by the females on account of the costume, which
differed in some respects from that of the Dutch domestic: the hair was
in a tight linen bag, a yellow half kerchief crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head from ear
to ear, but threw out a rectangular point that descended the centre of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) forehead, and it met in two more points over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bosom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wore a
red kirtle with long sleeves, kilted very high in front, and showing a
green farthingale and a great red leather purse hanging down over it;
red stockings, yellow leathern shoes, ahead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) age; for they were
low-quartered and square-toed, secured by a strap buckling over the
instep, which was not uncommon, and was perhaps the rude germ of the
diamond buckle to come.

<p/>Margaret continued:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But oh! how I missed my Denys at every step! often I sat down on the
road and groaned. And in the afternoon it chanced that I did so set me
down where two roads met, and with heavy head in hand, and heavy heart,
did think of thee, my poor sweetheart, and of my lost friend, and of the
little house at Tergou, where they all loved me once; though now it is
turned to hate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Alas! that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli. <div class="bookquote">``Whisht, wife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I did sigh loud, and often. And me sighing so, one came carolling
like a bird adown t' other road. `Ay, chirp and chirp,' cried I
bitterly. `Thou has not lost sweetheart, and friend, thy father's
hearth, thy mother's smile, and every penny in the world.' And at last
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did so carol, and carol, I jumped up in ire to get away from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) most
jarring mirth. But ere I lied from it, I looked down the path to see
what could make a man so lighthearted in this weary world; and lo! the
songster was a humpbacked cripple, with a bloody bandage o’er his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye,
and both legs gone at the knee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>went Sybrandt, laughing and cackling.

<p/>Margaret's eyes flashed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) began to fold the letter up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, lass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli, <div class="bookquote">``heed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not! Thou unmannerly cur, offer't but

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what was there to gibe at, Sybrandt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Catherine more
mildly. <div class="bookquote">``Is not our Kate afflicted? and is she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) not the most content of

worth the hearkening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>```Then,' said I, `may this thing be?' And I took myself to task.
`Gerard, son of Eli, dost thou well to bemoan thy lot, thou hast youth
and health; and here comes the wreck of nature on crutches, praising
God's goodness with singing like a mavis?'''

<p/>Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``There you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli. <div class="bookquote">``Whisht, dame, whisht!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) saw me, he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) left carolling and presently hobbled up and
chanted, `Charity, for love of Heaven, sweet master, charity,' with
a whine as piteous as wind at keyhole. `Alack, poor soul,' said I,
`charity is in my heart, but not my purse; I am poor as thou.' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
believed me none, and to melt me undid his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sleeve, and showed a sore
wound on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) arm, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), `Poor cripple though I be, I am like to
lose this eye to boot, look else.' I saw and groaned for him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and to
excuse myself let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wot how I had been robbed of my last copper.
Thereat he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) left whining all in a moment, and said, in a big manly voice,
`Then I'll e'en take a rest. Here, youngster, pull thou this strap: nay,
fear not!' I pulled, and down came a stout pair of legs out of his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) back;
and half his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) hump had melted away, and the wound in his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) eye no deeper
than the bandage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Margaret's hearers in a body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whereat, seeing me astounded, he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) laughed in my face, and told me I
was not worth gulling, and offered me his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) protection. `My face was
prophetic,' he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) said. `Of what?' said I. `Marry,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>), `that its
owner will starve in this thievish land.' Travel teaches e'en the young
wisdom. Time was I had turned and fled this impostor as a pestilence;
but now I listened patiently to pick up crumbs of counsel. And well I
did: for nature and his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) adventurous life had crammed the poor knave with
shrewdness and knowledge of the homelier sort--a child was I beside him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>).
When he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had turned me inside out, said he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>), `Didst well to leave France
and make for Germany; but think not of Holland again. Nay, on to
Augsburg and Nurnberg, the Paradise of craftsmen: thence to Venice, an
thou wilt. But thou wilt never bide in Italy nor any other land, having
once tasted the great German cities. Why, there is but one honest
country in Europe, and that is Germany; and since thou art honest, and
since I am a vagabone, Germany was made for us twain.' I bade him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) make
that good: how might one country fit true men and knaves! `Why, thou
novice,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>), `because in an honest land are fewer knaves to bite
the honest man, and many honest men for the knave to bite. I was in
luck, being honest, to have fallen in with a friendly sharp. Be my pal,'
said he (<font color='blue'><b>pal</b></font>); `I go to Nurnberg; we will reach it with full pouches. I'll
learn ye the cul de bois, and the cul de jatte, and how to maund, and
chaunt, and patter, and to raise swellings, and paint sores and ulcers
on thy body would take in the divell.' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>pal</b></font>) shivering, I'd liever
die than shame myself and my folk so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli. <div class="bookquote">``Good lad! good lad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what shame was it for such as I to turn beggar? Beggary was an
ancient and most honourable mystery. What did holy monks, and bishops,
and kings, when they would win Heaven's smile? why, wash the feet of
beggars, those favourites of the saints. `The saints were no fools,' he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)
told me. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) did put out his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) foot. `Look at that, that was washed by
the greatest king alive, Louis, of France, the last Holy Thursday that
was. And the next day, Friday, clapped in the stocks by the warden of
a petty hamlet.' So I told him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) my foot should walk between such high
honour and such low disgrace, on the same path of honesty, please
God. Well then, since I had not spirit to beg, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would indulge my
perversity. I should work under him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) be the head, I the fingers.
And with that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) set himself up like a judge, on a heap of dust by the
road's side, and questioned me strictly what I could do. I began to say
I was strong and willing. `Ba!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), `so is an ox. Say, what canst
do that Sir Ox cannot?' I could write; I had won a prize for it. `Canst
write as fast as the printers?' quo' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), jeering. `What else?' I could
paint. `That was better.' I was like to tear my hair to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) say so,
and me going to Rome to write. I could twang the psaltery a bit. `That
was well. Could I tell stories?' Ay, by the score. `Then,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), `I
hire you from this moment.' `What to do?' said I. `Nought crooked, Sir
Candour,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). `I will feed thee all the way and find thee work; and
take half thine earnings, no more.' `Agreed,' said I, and gave my hand
on it, `Now, servant,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), `we will dine. But ye need not stand
behind my chair, for two reasons--first I ha' got no chair; and next,
good fellowship likes me better than state.' And out of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wallet he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
brought flesh, fowl, and pastry, a good dozen of spices lapped in flax
paper, and wine fit for a king. Ne’er feasted I better than out of this
beggar's wallet, now my master. When we had well eaten I was for going
on. `But,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), `servants should not drive their masters too hard,
especially after feeding, for then the body is for repose, and the mind
turns to contemplation;' and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) back gazing calmly at the
sky, and presently wondered whether there were any beggars up there.
I told him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) I knew but of one, called Lazarus. `Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) do the cul de
jatte better than I?' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>), and looked quite jealous like. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>)
nay; Lazarus was honest, though a beggar, and fed daily of the crumbs
fal’n from a rich man's table, and the dogs licked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sores. `Servant,'
quo' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `I spy a foul fault in thee. Thou liest without discretion: now
the end of lying being to gull, this is no better than fumbling with the
divell's tail. I pray Heaven thou mayest prove to paint better than thou
cuttest whids, or I am done out of a dinner. No beggar eats crumbs, but
only the fat of the land; and dogs lick not a beggar's sores, being made
with spearwort, or ratsbane, or biting acids, from all which dogs, and
even pigs, abhor. My sores are made after my proper receipt; but no dog
would lick e'en them twice. I have made a scurvy bargain: art a cozening
knave, I doubt, as well as a nincompoop.' I deigned no reply to this
bundle of lies, which did accuse heavenly truth of falsehood for not
being in a tale with him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) rose and we took the road; and presently
we came to a place where were two little wayside inns, scarce a furlong
apart. `Halt,' said my master. `Their armories are sore faded--all the
better. Go thou in; shun the master; board the wife; and flatter her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) inn
sky high, all but the armories, and offer to colour them dirt cheap.'
So I went in and told the wife I was a painter, and would revive her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
armories cheap; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sent me away with a rebuff. I to my master. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
groaned. `Ye are all fingers and no tongue,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); `I have made a
scurvy bargain. Come and hear me patter and flatter.' Between the two
inns was a high hedge. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) goes behind it a minute and comes out a decent
tradesman. We went on to the other inn, and then I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) praise it
so fulsome as the very wife did blush. `But,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>), `there is one
little, little fault; your armories are dull and faded. Say but the
word, and for a silver franc my apprentice here, the cunningest e'er
I had, shall make them bright as ever. Whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hesitated, the rogue
told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) had done it to a little inn hard by, and now the inn's face
was like the starry firmament. `D’ye hear that, my man?' cries she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
```The Three Frogs''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>have been and painted up their armories; shall <div class="bookquote">``The
Four Hedgehogs''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>be outshone by them?' So I painted, and my master stood
by like a lord, advising me how to do, and winking to me to heed him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
none, and I got a silver franc. And he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) took me back to `The Three
Frogs,' and on the way put me on a beard and disguised me, and
flattered `The Three Frogs,' and told them how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had adorned `The Four
Hedgehogs,' and into the net jumped the three poor simple frogs, and I
earned another silver franc. Then we went on and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) crutches,
and sent me forward, and showed his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``cicatrices d’emprunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) called
them, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) infirmities, at `The Four Hedgehogs,' and got both
food and money. `Come, share and share,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>): so I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) one
franc. `I have made a good bargain,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). `Art a master limner, but
takest too much time.' So I let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) know that in matters of honest craft
things could not be done quick and well. `Then do them quick,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
And he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) told me my name was Bon Bec; and I might call him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) Cul de Jatte,
because that was his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lay at our first meeting. And at the next town my
master, Cul de Jatte, bought me a psaltery, and set himself up again
by the roadside in state like him (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) that erst judged Marsyas and Apollo,
piping for vain glory. So I played a strain. `Indifferent well,
harmonious Bon Bec,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) haughtily. `Now tune thy pipes.' So I did
sing a sweet strain the good monks taught me; and singing it reminded
poor Bon Bec, Gerard erst, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) young days and home, and brought the
water to my een. But looking up, my master's visage was as the face of
a little boy whipt soundly, or sipping foulest medicine. `Zounds, stop
that bellyache blether,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), `that will ne’er wile a stiver out
o' peasants' purses; `twill but sour the nurses' milk, and gar the kine
jump into rivers to be out of earshot on't. What, false knave, did I buy
thee a fine new psaltery to be minded o' my latter end withal? Hearken!
these be the songs that glad the heart, and fill the minstrel's purse.'
And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sung so blasphemous a stave, and eke so obscene, as I drew away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a space that the lightning might not spoil the new psaltery.
However, none came, being winter, and then I said, `Master, the Lord
is debonair. Held I the thunder, yon ribaldry had been thy last, thou
foul-mouthed wretch.'

<p/>```Why, Bon Bec, what is to do?' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). `I have made an ill bargain.
Oh, perverse heart, that turneth from doctrine.' So I bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) keep
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) breath to cool his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) broth, ne’er would I shame my folk with singing
ribald songs. `Then,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sulkily, `the first fire we light by the
wayside, clap thou on the music box! so `twill make our pot boil for the
nonce; but with your,

<p/>Good people, let us peak and pine,
Cut tristful mugs, and miaul and whine
Thorough our nosen chaunts divine,

<p/>never, never, never. Ye might as well go through Lorraine crying,
Mulleygrubs, Mulleygrubs, who'll buy my Mulleygrubs!' So we fared on,
bad friends. But I took a thought, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hum me one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
naughty ditties again. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) brightened, and broke forth into ribaldry
like a nightingale. Finger in ears stuffed I. `No words; naught but the
bare melody.' For oh, Margaret, note the sly malice of the Evil One!
Still to the scurviest matter he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wedded the tunablest ditties.''

<p/>Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``That is true as Holy Writ.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>```What tomfoolery is this,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>); yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) yielded to me, and soon I
garnered three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) melodies; but I would not let Cul de Jatte wot the
thing I meditated. `Show not fools nor bairns unfinished work,' saith
the byword. And by this time `twas night, and a little town at hand,
where we went each to his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) inn; for my master would not yield to put
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) rags and other sores till morning; nor I to enter an inn with
a tatterdemalion. So we were to meet on the road at peep of day, and
indeed, we still lodged apart, meeting at morn and parting at eve
outside each town we lay at. And waking at midnight and cogitating, good
thoughts came down to me, and sudden my heart was enlightened. I called
to mind that my Margaret had withstood the taking of the burgomaster's
purse. `'Tis theft,' said you; `disguise it how ye will.' But I must
be wiser than my betters; and now that which I had as good as stolen,
others had stolen from me. As it came so it was gone. Then I said,
`Heaven is not cruel, but just;' and I vowed a vow, to repay our
burgomaster every shilling an' I could. And I went forth in the morning
sad, but hopeful. I felt lighter for the purse being gone. My master was
at the gate becrutched. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) I'd liever have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in another
disguise. `Beggars must not be choosers,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). However, soon he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bade
me untruss him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) felt sadly. His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head swam. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) forcefully
to deform nature thus could scarce be wholesome. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) answered none; but
looked scared, and hand on head. By-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gave a groan, and rolled
on the ground like a ball, and writhed sore. I was scared, and wist
not what to do, but went to lift him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); but his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) trouble rose higher and
higher, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gnashed his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) teeth fearfully, and the foam did fly from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
lips; and presently his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) body bended itself like a bow, and jerked and
bounded many times into the air. I exorcised him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); it but made him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
worse. There was water in a ditch hard by, not very clear; but the poor
creature struggling between life and death, I filled my hat withal, and
came flying to souse him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). Then my lord laughed in my face. `Come, Bon
Bec, by thy white gills, I have not forgotten my trade.' I stood with
watery hat in hand, glaring. `Could this be feigning?' `What else?' said
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). `Why, a real fit is the sorriest thing; but a stroke with a feather
compared with mine. Art still betters nature.' `But look, e'en now blood
trickleth from your nose,' said I. `Ay, ay, pricked my nostrils with a
straw.' `But ye foamed at the lips.' `Oh, a little soap makes a mickle
foam.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) drew out a morsel like a bean from his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) mouth. `Thank thy
stars, Bon Bec,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), `for leading thee to a worthy master. Each day
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lesson. To-morrow we will study the cul de bois and other branches.
To-day, own me prince of demoniacs, and indeed of all good fellows.'
Then, being puffed up, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) forgot yesterday's grudge, and discoursed
me freely of beggars; and gave me, who eftsoons thought a beggar was a
beggar, and there an end, the names and qualities of full thirty sorts
of masterful and crafty mendicants in France and Germany and England;
his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) three provinces; for so the poor, proud knave yclept those kingdoms
three; wherein his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) throne it was the stocks I ween. And outside the next
village one had gone to dinner, and left his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) wheelbarrow. So says he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>),
`I'll tie myself in a knot, and shalt wheel me through; and what with
my crippledom and thy piety, a-wheeling of thy poor old dad, we'll bleed
the bumpkins of a dacha-saltee.' I did refuse. I would work for him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>); but
no hand would have in begging. `And wheeling an <div class="bookquote">``asker''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in a barrow, is
not that work?' said he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>); `then fling yon muckle stone in to boot: stay,
I'll soil it a bit, and swear it is a chip of the holy sepulchre; and
you wheeled us both from Jerusalem.' Said I, `Wheeling a pair o' lies,
one stony, one fleshy, may be work, and hard work, but honest work `tis
not. `Tis fumbling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) tail you wot of. And,' said I, `master, next
time you go to tempt me to knavery, speak not to me of my poor old dad.'
Said I, `You have minded me of my real father's face, the truest man in
Holland. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and I are ill friends now, worse luck. But though I offend
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shame him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I never will.' Dear Margaret, with this knave' saying,
`your poor old dad,' it had gone to my heart like a knife. `'Tis well,'
said my master gloomily; `I have made a bad bargain.' Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
halts, and eyes a tree by the wayside. `Go spell me what is writ on
yon tree.' So I went, and there was nought but a long square drawn in
outline. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) so. `So much for thy monkish lore,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). A
little farther, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sent me to read a wall. There was nought but a
circle scratched on the stone with a point of nail or knife, and in the
circle two dots. I said so Then said he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>), `Bon Bec, that square was a
warning. Some good Truand left it, that came through this village faring
west; that means <div class="bookquote">``dangerous.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The circle with the two dots was writ by
another of our brotherhood; and it signifies as how the writer, soit
Rollin Trapu, soit Triboulet, soit Catin Cul de Bois, or what not, was
becked for asking here, and lay two months in Starabin.' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) broke
forth. `Talk: of your little snivelling books that go in pouch. Three
books have I, France, England, and Germany; and they are writ all over
in one tongue, that my brethren of all countries understand; and that
is what I call learning. So sith here they whip sores, and imprison
infirmities, I to my tiring room.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) popped behind the hedge, and
came back worshipful. We passed through the village, and I sat me down
on the stocks, and even the barber's apprentice whets his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) razor on a
block, so did I flesh my psaltery on this village, fearing great cities.
I tuned it, and coursed up and down the wires nimbly with my two wooden
strikers; and then chanted loud and clear, as I had heard the minstrels
of the country,

<p/>`Qui veut ouir qui veut Savoir,'

<p/>some trash, I mind not what. And soon the villagers, male and female,
thronged about me; thereat I left singing, and recited them to the
psaltery a short but right merry tale out of `the lives of the saints,'
which it is my handbook of pleasant figments and this ended, instantly
struck up and whistled one of Cul de Jatte's devil's ditties, and played
it on the psaltery to boot. Thou knowest Heaven hath bestowed on me a
rare whistle, both for compass and tune. And with me whistling bright
and full this sprightly air, and making the wires slow when the tune did
gallop, and tripping when the tune did amble, or I did stop and shake on
one note like a lark i' the air, they were like to eat me; but looking
round, lo! my master had given way to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) itch, and there was his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hat
on the ground, and copper pouring in. I deemed it cruel to whistle the
bread out of poverty's pouch; so broke off and away; yet could not get
clear so swift, but both men and women did slobber me sore, and smelled
all of garlic. `There, master,' said I, `I call that cleaving the divell
in twain and keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) white half.' Said he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>), `Bon Bec, I have made
a good bargain.' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) bade me stay where I was while he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) went to the
Holy Land. I stayed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) leaped the churchyard dike, and the sexton
was digging a grave, and my master chaffered with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and came back
with a knuckle bone. But why he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) clept a churchyard Holy Land, that I
learned not then, but after dinner. I was colouring the armories of a
little inn; and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sat by me most peaceable, a cutting, and filing, and
polishing bones, sedately; so I speered was not honest work sweet? `As
rain water,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), mocking. `What was he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a making?' `A pair of bones
to play on with thee; and with the refuse a St. Anthony's thumb and
a St. Martin's little finger, for the devout.' The vagabone! And now,
sweet Margaret, thou seest our manner of life faring Rhineward. I with
the two arts I had least prized or counted on for bread was welcome
everywhere; too poor now to fear robbers, yet able to keep both master
and man on the road. For at night I often made a portraiture of the
innkeeper or his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) dame, and so went richer from an inn; the which it is
the lot of few. But my master despised this even way of life. `I love
ups and downs,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). And certes he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lacked them not. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would
gather more than I in three; another, to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tale, it had rained
kicks all day in lieu of `saltees,' and that is pennies. Yet even then
at heart he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) despised me for a poor mechanical soul, and scorned my arts,
extolling his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own, the art of feigning.

<p/>``Natheless, at odd times was he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ill at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ease. Going through the town
of Aix, we came upon a beggar walking, fast by one hand to a cart-tail,
and the hangman a lashing his (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) bare bloody back. He (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>), stout knave, so
whipt, did not a jot relent; but I did wince at every stroke; and my
master hung his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head.

<p/>```Soon or late, Bon Bec,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). `Soon or late.' I, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
haggard face, knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) meaned. And at a town whose name hath slipped
me, but `twas on a fair river, as we came to the foot of the bridge he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
halted, and shuddered. `Why what is the coil?' said I. `Oh, blind,' said
he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), `they are justifying there.' So nought would serve him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) but take a
boat, and cross the river by water. But `twas out of the frying-pan, as
the word goeth. For the boatman had scarce told us the matter, and that
it was a man and a woman for stealing glazed windows out of housen, and
that the man was hanged at daybreak, and the quean to be drowned, when
lo! they did fling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) off the bridge, and fell in the water not far
from us. And oh! Margaret, the deadly splash! It ringeth in mine ears
even now. But worse was coming; for, though tied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came up and cried
`Help! help!' and I, forgetting all, and hearing a woman's voice cry
`Help!' was for leaping in to save her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and had surely done it, but the
boatman and Cul de Jatte clung round me, and in a moment the bourreau's
man, that waited in a boat, came and entangled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hooked pole in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
long hair, and so thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) down and ended her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Oh! if the saints
answered so our cries for help! And poor Cul de Jatte groaned; and I
sat sobbing, and beat my breast, and cried, `Of what hath God made men's
hearts?'''

<p/>The reader stopped, and the tears trickled down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheeks. Gerard
crying in Lorraine, made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cry at Rotterdam. The leagues were no more
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart than the breadth of a room.

<p/>Eli, softened by many touches in the letter, and by the reader's womanly
graces, said kindly enough, <div class="bookquote">``Take thy time, lass. And methinks some of
ye might find her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) a creepie to rest her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) foot, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) so near her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) own

carefully under her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, dame,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) faltered. ``I will read on; `tis all I can

<p/>``Thus seeing my master ashy and sore shaken, I deemed this horrible
tragic act came timeously to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), so I strove sore to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) from
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ill ways, discoursing of sinners and their lethal end. `Too late!'
said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), `too late!' and gnashed his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) teeth. Then I told him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) `too late'
was the divell's favourite whisper in repentant ears. Said I--

<p/>`The Lord is debonair,
Let sinners nought despair.'

<p/>`Too late!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and gnashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) teeth, and writhed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) face, as
though vipers were biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) inward parts. But, dear heart, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was a
mind like running water. Ere we cleared the town he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was carolling, and
outside the gate hung the other culprit, from the bough of a little
tree, and scarce a yard above the ground. And that stayed my vagabone's
music. But ere we had gone another furlong, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) feigned to have dropped
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), rosary, and ran back, with no good intent, as you shall hear.
I strolled on very slowly, and often halting, and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) came
stumping up on one leg, and that bandaged. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could
contrive that, for `twas masterly done. `Oh, that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) mystery. Would
I know that, I must join the brotherhood.' And presently we did pass
a narrow lane, and at the mouth on't espied a written stone, telling
beggars by a word like a wee pitchfork to go that way. `'Tis yon
farmhouse,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>): `bide thou at hand.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) went to the house, and
came back with money, food, and wine. `This lad did the business,' said
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) one leg proudly. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) undid the bandage, and with
prideful face showed me a hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) calf you could have put your neef
in. Had I been strange to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) tricks, here was a leg had drawn my last
penny. Presently another farmhouse by the road. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) made for it. I stood,
and asked myself, should I run away and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), not to be shamed in
my own despite by him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)? But while I doubted, there was a great noise,
and my master well cudgelled by the farmer and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) men, came towards me
hobbling and holloaing, for the peasants had laid on heartily. But more
trouble was at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) heels. Some mischievous wight loosed a dog as big as
a jackass colt, and came roaring after him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and downed him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) momently. I,
deeming the poor rogue's death certain, and him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) least fit to die, drew
my sword and ran shouting. But ere I could come near, the muckle dog had
torn away his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) bad leg, and ran growling to his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) lair with it; and Cul de
Jatte slipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) knot, and came running like a lapwing, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) hair
on end, and so striking with both crutches before and behind at unreal
dogs as `twas like a windmill crazed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) fled adown the road. I followed
leisurely, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) at dinner. `Curse the quiens,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>). And not
a word all dinner time but `Curse the quiens!'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said, I must know who' they were, before I would curse them.

<p/>```Quiens? why, that was dogs. And I knew not even that much? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) had made
a bad bargain. Well, well,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>), `to-morrow we shall be in Germany.
There the folk are music bitten, and they molest not beggars, unless
they fake to boot, and then they drown us out of hand that moment, curse
`em!' We came to Strasbourg. And I looked down Rhine with longing heart.
The stream how swift! It seemed running to clip Sevenbergen to its soft
bosom. With but a piece of timber and an oar I might drift at my ease to
thee, sleeping yet gliding still. `Twas a sore temptation. But the fear
of an ill welcome from my folk, and of the neighbours' sneers, and the
hope of coming back to thee victorious, not, as now I must, defeated and
shamed, and thee with me, it did withhold me; and so, with many sighs,
and often turning of the head to look on beloved Rhine, I turned
sorrowful face and heavy heart towards Augsburg.''

<p/>``The Germans are fonder of armorials than the French. So I found work
every day. And whiles I wrought, my master would leave me, and doff his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
raiment and don his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) rags, and other infirmities, and cozen the world,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did clepe it `plucking of the goose:' this done, would meet me
and demand half my earnings; and with restless piercing eye ask me would
I be so base as cheat my poor master by making three parts in lieu of
two, till I threatened to lend him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a cuff to boot in requital of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
suspicion; and thenceforth took his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) due, with feigned confidence in my
good faith, the which his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) dancing eye belied. Early in Germany we had
a quarrel. I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) buy a skull of a jailer's wife, and mighty
zealous a polishing it. Thought I, `How can he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) carry yon memento,
and not repent, seeing where ends his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) way?' Presently I did catch him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
selling it to a woman for the head of St. Barnabas, with a tale had
cozened an Ebrew. So I snatched it out of their hands, and trundled it
into the ditch. `How, thou impious knave,' said I, `wouldst sell for
a saint the skull of some dead thief, thy brother?' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) slunk away. But
shallow she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did crawl after the skull, and with apron reverently dust
it for Barnabas, and it Barabbas; and so home with it. Said I, `Non vult
anser velli, sed populus vult decipi.'''

<p/>Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, the goodly Latin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, I know not; but `tis Latin; is not that enow? He (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) was
the flower of the flock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Then I to him (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>), `Take now thy psaltery, and part we here, for art a
walking prison, a walking hell.' But lo! my master fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knees,
and begged me for pity's sake not turn him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) off. `What would become of
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did so love honesty.' `Thou love honesty?' said I. `Ay,' said
he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), `not to enact it; the saints forbid. But to look on. `Tis so fair
a thing to look on. Alas, good Bon Bec,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); `hadst starved
peradventure but for me. Kick not down thy ladder! Call ye that just?
Nay, calm thy choler! Have pity on me! I must have a pal; and how could
I bear one like myself after one so simple as thou? He (<font color='blue'><b>pal</b></font>) might cut my
throat for the money that is hid in my belt. `Tis not much; `tis not
much. With thee I walk at mine ease; with a sharp I dare not go before
in a narrow way. Alas! forgive me. Now I know where in thy bonnet lurks
the bee, I will ware his (<font color='blue'><b>pal</b></font>) sting; I will but pluck the secular goose. `So
be it,' said I. `And example was contagious: he (<font color='blue'><b>pal</b></font>) should be a true man by
then we reached Nurnberg. `Twas a long way to Nurnberg.' Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>pal</b></font>) so
humble, I said, `well, doff rags, and make thyself decent; `twill
help me forget what thou art.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>pal</b></font>) did so; and we sat down to our
nonemete. Presently came by a reverend palmer with hat stuck round with
cockle shells from Holy Land, and great rosary of beads like eggs of
teal, and sandals for shoes. And he (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) leaned a-weary on his (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) long staff,
and offered us a shell apiece. My master would none. But I, to set him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
a better example, took one, and for it gave the poor pilgrim two batzen,
and had his (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) blessing. And he (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) was scarce gone, when we heard savage
cries, and came a sorry sight, one leading a wild woman in a chain, all
rags and howling like a wolf. And when they came nigh us, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fell to
tearing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rags to threads. The man sought an alms of us, and told us
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hard case. `Twas his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife stark raving mad; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not work in
the fields, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house to fire it, nor cure her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could
be without the Saintys' help, and had vowed six pounds of wax to St.
Anthony to heal her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and so was fain beg of charitable folk for the
money. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) espied us, and flew at me with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) long nails, and
I was cold with fear, so devilish showed, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face and rolling eyes and
nails like birdys talons. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) with the chain checked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sudden,
and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) whip did cruelly lash her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for it, that I cried, `Forbear!
forbear! She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knoweth not what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doth;' and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) a batz. And being
gone, said I, `Master, of those twain I know not which is the more
pitiable.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) laughed in my face, `Behold thy justice, Bon Bec,'
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>). `Thou railest on thy poor, good, within an ace of honest
master, and bestowest alms on a ``vopper.''' `Vopper,' said I, `what is
a vopper?' `why, a trull that feigns madness. That was one of us, that
sham maniac, and wow but she (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) did it clumsily. I blushed for her (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) and
thee. Also gavest two batzen for a shell from Holy Land, that came
no farther than Normandy. I have culled them myself on that coast by
scores, and sold them to pilgrims true and pilgrims false, to gull flats
like thee withal.' `What!' said I; `that reverend man?' `One of us!'
cried Cul de Jatte; `one of us! In France we call them <div class="bookquote">``Coquillarts,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but here <div class="bookquote">``Calmierers.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Railest on me for selling a false relic now and
then, and wastest thy earnings on such as sell nought else. I tell thee,
Bon Bec,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>), `there is not one true relic on earth's face. The
Saints died a thousand years agone, and their bones mixed with the
dust; but the trade in relics, it is of yesterday; and there are forty
thousand tramps in Europe live by it; selling relics of forty or fifty
bodies; oh, threadbare lie! And of the true Cross enow to build Cologne
Minster. Why, then, may not poor Cul de Jatte turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) penny with the
crowd? Art but a scurvy tyrannical servant to let thy poor master from
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) share of the swag with your whoreson pilgrims, palmers and friars,
black, grey, and crutched; for all these are of our brotherhood, and of
our art, only masters they, and we but poor apprentices, in guild.' For
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tongue was an ell and a half.

<p/>```A truce to thy irreverend sophistries,' said I, `and say what company
is this a coming.' `Bohemians,' cried he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), `Ay, ay, this shall be the
rest of the band.' With that came along so motley a crew as never your
eyes beheld, dear Margaret. Marched at their head one with a banner on
a steel-pointed lance, and girded with a great long sword, and in velvet
doublet and leathern jerkin, the which stuffs ne’er saw I wedded afore
on mortal flesh, and a gay feather in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lordly cap, and a couple of
dead fowls at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) back, the which, an the spark had come by honestly, I
am much mistook. Him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) followed wives and babes on two lean horses, whose
flanks still rattled like parchment drum, being beaten by kettles and
caldrons. Next an armed man a-riding of a horse, which drew a cart full
of females and children; and in it, sitting backwards, a lusty
lazy knave, lance in hand, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) luxurious feet raised on a holy
water-pail, that lay along, and therein a cat, new kittened, sat glowing
o’er her (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) brood, and sparks for eyes. And the cart-horse cavalier had on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders a round bundle, and thereon did perch a cock and crowed
with zeal, poor ruffler, proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brave feathers as the rest, and
haply with more reason, being his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. And on an ass another wife and
new-born child; and one poor quean a-foot scarce dragged herself along,
so near her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) time was she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), yet held two little ones by the hand, and
helplessly helped them on the road. And the little folk were just a
farce; some rode sticks, with horses' heads, between their legs, which
pranced and caracoled, and soon wearied the riders so sore, they stood
stock still and wept, which cavaliers were presently taken into cart and
cuffed. And one, more grave, lost in a man's hat and feather, walked in
Egyptian darkness, handed by a girl; another had the great saucepan on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, and a tremendous three-footed clay-pot sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head
and shoulders, swallowing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too went darkling led by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sweetheart three foot high. When they were gone by, and we had both
laughed lustily, said I, `Natheless, master, my bowels they yearn for
one of that tawdry band, even for the poor wife so near the downlying,
scarce able to drag herself, yet still, poor soul, helping the weaker on
the way.'

would show,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), `wait till they camp.' And rising after meat and
meditation, and travelling forward, we found them camped between two
great trees on a common by the wayside; and they had lighted a great
fire, and on it was their caldron; and one of the trees slanting o’er
the fire, a kid hung down by a chain from the tree-fork to the fire,
and in the fork was wedged an urchin turning still the chain to keep the
meat from burning, and a gay spark with a feather in his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) cap cut up
a sheep; and another had spitted a leg of it on a wooden stake; and a
woman ended chanticleer's pride with wringing of his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) neck. And under
the other tree four rufflers played at cards and quarrelled, and no word
sans oath; and of these lewd gamblers one had cockles in his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) hat and was
my reverend pilgrim. And a female, young and comely, and dressed like a
butterfly, sat and mended a heap of dirty rags. And Cul de Jatte said,
`Yon is the ``vopper,''' and I looked incredulous and looked again, and it
was so, and at her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) feet sat he (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) that had so late lashed her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>); but I ween
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) had wist where to strike, or woe betide him (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) did now oppress
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) sore, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) thread her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) very needle, the which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jatte</b></font>) did with
all humility; so was their comedy turned seamy side without; and Cul de
Jatte told me `twas still so with `voppers' and their men in camp; they
would don their bravery though but for an hour, and with their tinsel,
empire, and the man durst not the least gainsay the `vopper,' or she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)
would turn him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off at these times, as I my master, and take another
tyrant more submissive. And my master chuckled over me. Natheless we
soon espied a wife set with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) back against the tree, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair
down, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face white, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side a wench held up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eye a
newborn babe, with words of cheer, and the rough fellow, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband,
did bring her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hot wine in a cup, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) take courage. And just
o’er the place she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat, they had pinned from bough to bough of those
neighbouring trees two shawls, and blankets two, together, to keep the
drizzle off her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). And so had another poor little rogue come into the
world; and by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own particular folk tended gipsywise, but of the
roasters, and boilers, and voppers, and gamblers, no more noticed, no,
not for a single moment, than sheep which droppeth her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lamb in a field,
by travellers upon the way. Then said I, `What of thy foul suspicions,
master? over-knavery blinds the eye as well as over-simplicity.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
laughed and said, `Triumph, Bon Bec, triumph. The chances were nine in
ten against thee.' Then I did pity her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), to be in a crowd at such a
time; but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) rebuked me. `I should pity rather your queens and royal
duchesses, which by law are condemned to groan in a crowd of nobles and
courtiers, and do writhe with shame as, well as sorrow, being come of
decent mothers, whereas these gipsy women have no more shame under their
skins than a wolf ruth, or a hare valour. And, Bon Bec,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>), `I
espy in thee a lamentable fault. Wastest thy bowels, wilt have none left
for thy poor good master which doeth thy will by night and day.' Then
we came forward; and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) talked with the men in some strange Hebrew cant
whereof no word knew I; and the poor knaves bade us welcome and denied
us nought. With them, and all they had, `twas lightly come and lightly
go; and when we left them, my master said to me `This is thy first
lesson, but to-night we shall lie at Hansburgh. Come with me to the
``rotboss'' there, and I'll show thee all our folk and their lays,
and especially ``the lossners,'' ``the dutzers,'' ``the schleppers,'' ``the

stopping him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), `art as gleesome as the Evil One a counting of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) imps.
I'll jot down in my tablet all these caitiffs and their accursed names:
for knowledge is knowledge. But go among them, alive or dead, that will
I not with my good will. Moreover,' said I, `what need? since I have a
companion in thee who is all the knaves on earth in one?' and thought to
abash him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) but his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) face shone with pride, and hand on breast he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) did bow
low to me. `If thy wit be scant, good Bon Bec, thy manners are a charm.
I have made a good bargain.' So he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to the `rotboss,' and I to a decent
inn, and sketched the landlord's daughter by candle-light, and started
at morn batzen three the richer, but could not find my master, so
loitered slowly on, and presently met him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) coming west for me, and
cursing the quiens. Why so? Because he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could blind the culls but not
the quiens. At last I prevailed on him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to leave cursing and canting,
and tell me his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) adventure. Said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), `I sat outside the gate of yon
monastery, full of sores, which I sho’ed the passers-by. Oh, Bon Bec,
beautifuller sores you never saw; and it rained coppers in my hat.
Presently the monks came home from some procession, and the convent dogs
ran out to meet them, curse the quiens!' `What, did they fall on thee
and bite thee, poor soul?' `Worse, worse, dear Bon Bec. Had they
bitten me I had earned silver. But the great idiots, being, as I think,
puppies, or little better, fell on me where I sat, downed me, and fell
a licking my sores among them. As thou, false knave, didst swear the
whelps in heaven licked the sores of Lazybones, a beggar of old.' `Nay,
nay,' said I, `I said no such thing. But tell me, since they bit thee
not, but sportfully licked thee, what harm?' `What harm, noodle; why,
the sores came off.' `How could that be?' `How could aught else be? and
them just fresh put on. Did I think he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was so weak as bite holes in his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)
flesh with ratsbane? Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was an artist, a painter, like his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) servant,
and had put on sores made of pig's blood, rye meal, and glue. So when
the folk saw my sores go on tongues of puppies, they laughed, and I
saw cord or sack before me. So up I jumped, and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``A miracle a
miracle! The very dogs of this holy convent be holy, and have cured me.
Good fathers,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried I, <div class="bookquote">``whose day is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``St. Isidore's,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one.
<div class="bookquote">``St. Isidore,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried I, in a sort of rapture. <div class="bookquote">``Why, St. Isidore is
my patron saint: so that accounts.''  (<font color='red'><b>the folk</b></font>)</div>And the simple folk swallowed my
miracle as those accursed quiens my wounds. But the monks took me inside
and shut the gate, and put their heads together; but I have a quick ear,
and one did say, <div class="bookquote">``Caret miraculo monasterium,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which is Greek patter,
leastways it is no beggar's cant. Finally they bade the lay brethren
give me a hiding, and take me out a back way and put me on the road, and
threatened me did I come back to the town to hand me to the magistrate
and have me drowned for a plain impostor. <div class="bookquote">``Profit now by the Church's
grace,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said they, <div class="bookquote">``and mend thy ways.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bon Bec</b></font>)</div>So forward, Bon Bec, for my life
is not sure nigh hand this town.' As we went he (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) worked his (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) shoulders,
`Wow but the brethren laid on. And what means yon piece of monk's cant,
I wonder?' So I told him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) the words meant `the monastery is in want of a
miracle,' but the application thereof was dark to me. `Dark,' cried
he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>), `dark as noon. Why, it means they are going to work the miracle,
my miracle, and gather all the grain I sowed. Therefore these blows on
their benefactor's shoulders; therefore is he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) that wrought their scurry
miracle driven forth with stripes and threats. Oh, cozening knaves!'
Said I, `Becomes you to complain of guile.' `Alas, Bon Bec,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>), `I
but outwit the simple, but these monks would pluck Lucifer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>)
wing feathers.' And went a league bemoaning himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) was not
convent-bred like his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) servant `He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) would put it to more profit;' and
railing on quiens. `And as for those monks, there was one Above.'
`Certes,' said I, `there is one Above. What then?' `Who will call those
shavelings to compt, one day,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>). `And all deceitful men' said
I. At one that afternoon I got armories to paint: so my master took the
yellow jaundice and went begging through the town, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) oily
tongue, and saffron-water face, did fill his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hat. Now in all the towns
are certain licensed beggars, and one of these was an old favourite
with the townsfolk: had his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) station at St. Martin's porch, the greatest
church: a blind man: they called him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) blind Hans. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) saw my master
drawing coppers on the other side the street, and knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) tricks
for an impostor, so sent and warned the constables, and I met my master
in the constables' hands, and going to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) trial in the town hall. I
followed and many more; and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was none abashed, neither by the pomp
of justice, nor memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) misdeeds, but demanded his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) accuser like a
trumpet. And blind Hans's boy came forward, but was sifted narrowly by
my master, and stammered and faltered, and owned he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had seen nothing,
but only carried blind Hans's tale to the chief constable. `This is but
hearsay,' said my master. `Lo ye now, here standeth Misfortune backbit
by Envy. But stand thou forth, blind Envy, and vent thine own lie.' And
blind Hans behoved to stand forth, sore against his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) will. Him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) did my
master so press with questions, and so pinch and torture, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
again and again, how, being blind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) could see all that befell, and
some that befell not, across a way; and why, an he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) could not see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
came there holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) perjured hand, and maligning the misfortunate,
that at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) groaned aloud and would utter no word more. And an
alderman said, `In sooth, Hans, ye are to blame; hast cast more dirt of
suspicion on thyself than on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>).' But the burgomaster, a wondrous fat
man, and methinks of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fat some had gotten into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, checked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
and said, `Nay, Hans we know this many years, and be he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) blind or not,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) hath passed for blind so long, `tis all one. Back to thy porch, good
Hans, and let the strange varlet leave the town incontinent on pain of
whipping.' Then my master winked to me; but there rose a civic officer
in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gown of state and golden chain, a Dignity with us lightly prized,
and even shunned of some, but in Germany and France much courted, save
by condemned malefactors, to wit the hangman; and says he (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>), `Ant please
you, first let us see why he (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) weareth his (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) hair so thick and low.' And his (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>)
man went and lifted Cul de Jatte's hair, and lo, the upper gristle of
both ears was gone. `How is this knave? quoth the burgomaster. My
master said carelessly, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) minded not precisely: his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had been a life of
misfortunes and losses. When a poor soul has lost the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) leg,
noble sirs, these more trivial woes rest lightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) memory.' When
he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) found this would not serve his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) turn, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) named two famous battles,
in each of which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had lost half an ear, a fighting like a true man
against traitors and rebels. But the hangman showed them the two cuts
were made at one time, and by measurement. `'Tis no bungling soldiers'
work, my masters,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>), `'tis ourn.' Then the burgomaster gave
judgment: `The present charge is not proven against thee; but, an thou
beest not guilty now, thou hast been at other times, witness thine ears.
Wherefore I send thee to prison for one month, and to give a florin
towards the new hall of the guilds now a building, and to be whipt
out of the town, and pay the hangman's fee for the same.' And all the
aldermen approved, and my master was haled to prison with one look of
anguish. It did strike my bosom. I tried to get speech of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), but the
jailer denied me. But lingering near the jail I heard a whistle, and
there was Cul de Jatte at a narrow window twenty feet from earth. I went
under, and he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) asked me what made I there? I told him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) I was loath to go
forward and not bid him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) farewell. He (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) seemed quite amazed; but soon his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>)
suspicious soul got the better. That was not all mine errand. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>)
not all: the psaltery: `Well, what of that?' `Twas not mine, but his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>); I
would pay him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) the price of it. `Then throw me a rix dollar,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>).
I counted out my coins, and they came to a rix dollar and two batzen.
I threw him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) up his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) money in three throws, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) had got it all
he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) said, softly, `Bon Bec.' `Master,' said I. Then the poor rogue was
greatly moved. `I thought ye had been mocking me,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>); `oh, Bon
Bec, Bon Bec, if I had found the world like thee at starting I had put
my wit to better use, and I had not lain here.' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) whimpered out,
`I gave not quite a rix dollar for the jingler;' and threw me back that
he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) had gone to cheat me of; honest for once, and over late; and so, with
many sighs, bade me Godspeed. Thus did my master, after often baffling
men's justice, fall by their injustice; for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lost ears proved not his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
guilt only, but of that guilt the bitter punishment: so the account was
even; yet they for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) chastisement did chastise him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). Natheless he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was a
parlous rogue. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) holp to make a man of me. Thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) good wit
I went forward richer far with my psaltery and brush, than with yon as
good as stolen purse; for that must have run dry in time, like a big
trough, but these a little fountain.''

<p/>Richart. <div class="bookquote">``How pregnant his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) reflections be; and but a curly pated lad

Denys sweetened the air on the way; but poor Cul de Jatte poisoned
it. The next day passing a grand house, out came on prancing steeds

gentleman bade me halt. I laughed in my sleeve; for a few batzen were
all my store. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bade me doff my doublet and jerkin. Then I chuckled
no more. `Bethink you, my lord,' said I, `'tis winter. How may a poor
fellow go bare and live? So he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) told me I shot mine arrow wide of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
thought, and off with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own gay jerkin, richly furred, and doublet to
match, and held them forth to me. Then a servant let me know it was a
penance. `His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lordship had had the ill luck to slay his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cousin in their
cups.' Down to my shoes he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) changed with me; and set me on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) horse like
a popinjay, and fared by my side in my worn weeds, with my psaltery on
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) back. And said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), `Now, good youth, thou art Cousin Detstein; and
I, late count, thy Servant. Play the part well, and help me save my
bloodstained soul! Be haughty and choleric, as any noble; and I will be
as humble as I may.' I said I would do my best to play the noble. But
what should I call him (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) bade me call him (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) nought but Servant. That
would mortify him (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) most, he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) wist. We rode on a long way in silence; for
I was meditating this strange chance, that from a beggar's servant had
made me master to a count, and also cudgelling my brains how best I
might play the master, without being run through the body all at one
time like his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cousin. For I mistrusted sore my spark's humility; your
German nobles being, to my knowledge, proud as Lucifer, and choleric
as fire. As for the servants, they did slily grin to one another to see
their master so humbled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A lump, as of lead, had just bounced against the door, and the latch was
fumbled with unsuccessfully. Another bounce, and the door swung inwards
with Giles arrayed in cloth of gold sticking to it like a wasp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
landed on the floor, and was embraced; but on learning what was going
on, trumpeted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) would much liever hear of Gerard than gossip.

<p/>Sybrandt pointed to a diminutive chair.

<p/>Giles showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) sense of this civility by tearing the said Sybrandt
out of a very big one, and there ensconced himself gorgeous and glowing.
Sybrandt had to wedge himself into the one, which was too small for the
magnificent dwarf's soul, and Margaret resumed. But as this part of the
letter was occupied with notices of places, all which my reader probably
knows, and if not, can find handled at large in a dozen well-known
books, from Munster to Murray, I skip the topography, and hasten to that
part where it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) to throw his (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) letter into a journal. The
personal narrative that intervened may be thus condensed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) spoke but little at first to his (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) new companions, but listened to pick
up their characters. Neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) noble Servant nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) servants could
read or write; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) often made entries in his (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) tablets, he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) impressed
them with some awe. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) entries was, <div class="bookquote">``Le peu que sont les
hommes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) found the surly innkeepers licked the very ground
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) now; nor did a soul suspect the hosier's son in the count's
feathers, nor the count in the minstrel's weeds.

<p/>This seems to have surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) enlarged on it with the naivete
and pomposity of youth. At one place, being humbly requested to present
the inn with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) armorial bearings, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) consented loftily; but painted
them himself, to mine host's wonder, who thought he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lowered himself
by handling brush. The true count stood grinning by, and held the
paint-pot, while the sham count painted the shield with three
red herrings rampant under a sort of Maltese cross made with two
ell-measures. At first his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) plebeian servants were insolent. But this
coming to the notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) noble one, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) forgot what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was doing
penance for, and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sword to cut off their ears, heads included.
But Gerard interposed and saved them, and rebuked the count severely.
And finally they all understood one another, and the superior mind
obtained its natural influence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) played the barbarous noble of that
day vilely. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) be either tyrannical or
cold. Here were three human beings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) tried to make them all happier
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was; held them ravished with stories and songs, and set Herr
Penitent and Co. dancing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) whistle and psaltery. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own
convenience he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) made them ride and tie, and thus pushed rapidly through
the country, travelling generally fifteen leagues a day.


<p/>DIARY.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This first day of January I observed a young man of the country to meet
a strange maiden, and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and then held it out to her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
took it with a smile, and lo! acquaintance made; and babbled like old
friends. Greeting so pretty and delicate I ne’er did see. Yet were they
both of the baser sort. So the next lass I saw a coming, I said to my
servant lord, `For further penance bow thy pride; go meet yon base-born
girl; kiss thy homicidal hand, and give it her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and hold her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in
discourse as best ye may.' And my noble Servant said humbly, `I shall
obey my lord.' And we drew rein and watched while he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) went forward,
kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) hand and held it out to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Forthwith she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took it smiling,
and was most affable with him (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Presently came up a band
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companions. So this time I bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) doff his (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) bonnet to them, as

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret. -LRB-Reading suddenly.-RRB- ``Which their affability I put to profit
thus. I asked them how they made shift to grow roses in yule? For know,
dear Margaret, that throughout Germany, the baser sort of lasses wear
for head-dress nought but a `crantz,' or wreath of roses, encircling
their bare hair, as laurel Caesar's; and though of the worshipful,
scorned, yet is braver, I wist, to your eye and mine which painters be,
though sorry ones, than the gorgeous, uncouth, mechanical head-gear of
the time, and adorns, not hides her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hair, that goodly ornament fitted
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head by craft divine. So the good lasses, being questioned close,
did let me know, the rosebuds are cut in summer and laid then in great
clay-pots, thus ordered:--first bay salt, then a row of buds, and over
that row bay salt sprinkled; then, another row of buds placed crosswise;
for they say it is death to the buds to touch one another; and so on,
buds and salt in layers. Then each pot is covered and soldered tight,
and kept in cool cellar. And on Saturday night the master of the house,
or mistress, if master be none, opens a pot, and doles the rosebuds out
to every female in the house, high or low, withouten grudge; then
solders it up again. And such as of these buds would full-blown roses
make, put them in warm water a little space, or else in the stove, and
then with tiny brush and soft, wetted in Rhenish wine, do coax them till
they ope their folds. And some perfume them with rose-water. For, alack,
their smell it is fled with the summer; and only their fair bodyes lie
withouten soul, in tomb of clay, awaiting resurrection.

<p/>``And some with the roses and buds mix nutmegs gilded, but not by my good
will; for gold, brave in itself, cheek by jowl with roses, is but yellow
earth. And it does the eye's heart good to see these fair heads of hair
come, blooming with roses, over snowy roads, and by snow-capt hedges,
setting winter's beauty by the side of summer's glory. For what so
fair as winter's lilies, snow yclept, and what so brave as roses? And
shouldst have had a picture here, but for their superstition. Leaned a
lass in Sunday garb, cross ankled, against her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) cottage corner, whose
low roof was snow-clad, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) crantz did seem a summer flower
sprouting from winter's bosom. I drew rein, and out pencil and brush to
limn her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) for thee. But the simpleton, fearing the evil eye, or glamour,
claps both hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) face and flies panic-stricken. But indeed, they
are not more superstitious than the Sevenbergen folk, which take thy
father for a magician. Yet softly, sith at this moment I profit by
this darkness of their minds; for, at first, sitting down to write this
diary, I could frame nor thought nor word, so harried and deaved was I
with noise of mechanical persons, and hoarse laughter at dull jests of
one of these particoloured `fools,' which are so rife in Germany. But
oh, sorry wit, that is driven to the poor resource of pointed ear-caps,
and a green and yellow body. True wit, methinks, is of the mind. We
met in Burgundy an honest wench, though over free for my palate, a
chambermaid, had made havoc of all these zanies, droll by brute force.
Oh, Digressor! Well then, I to be rid of roaring rusticalls, and
mindless jests, put my finger in a glass and drew on the table a great
watery circle; whereat the rusticalls did look askant, like venison at
a cat; and in that circle a smaller circle. The rusticalls held their
peace; and besides these circles cabalistical, I laid down on the table
solemnly yon parchment deed I had out of your house. The rusticalls held
their breath. Then did I look as glum as might be, and muttered
slowly thus `Videamus--quam diu tu fictus morio--vosque veri
stulti--audebitis--in hac aula morari, strepitantes ita--et olentes: ut
dulcissimae nequeam miser scribere.' They shook like aspens, and stole
away on tiptoe one by one at first, then in a rush and jostling, and
left me alone; and most scared of all was the fool: never earned jester
fairer his (<font color='blue'><b>jester</b></font>) ass's ears. So rubbed I their foible, who first rubbed mine;
for of all a traveller's foes I dread those giants twain, Sir Noise, and
eke Sir Stench. The saints and martyrs forgive my peevishness. Thus I
write to thee in balmy peace, and tell thee trivial things scarce worthy
ink, also how I love thee, which there was no need to tell, for well
thou knowest it. And oh, dear Margaret, looking on their roses, which
grew in summer, but blow in winter, I see the picture of our true
affection; born it was in smiles and bliss, but soon adversity beset
us sore with many a bitter blast. Yet our love hath lost no leaf, thank
God, but blossoms full and fair as ever, proof against frowns, and
jibes, and prison, and banishment, as those sweet German flowers a
blooming in winter's snow.

<p/>``January 2.--My servant, the count, finding me curious, took me to the
stables of the prince that rules this part. In the first court was a
horse-bath, adorned with twenty-two pillars, graven with the prince's
arms; and also the horse-leech's shop, so furnished as a rich apothecary
might envy. The stable is a fair quadrangle, whereof three sides filled
with horses of all nations. Before each horse's nose was a glazed
window, with a green curtain to be drawn at pleasure, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) tail a
thick wooden pillar with a brazen shield, whence by turning of a pipe he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)
is watered, and serves too for a cupboard to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) comb and rubbing
clothes. Each rack was iron, and each manger shining copper, and each
nag covered with a scarlet mantle, and above him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) bridle and saddle
hung, ready to gallop forth in a minute; and not less than two hundred
horses, whereof twelve score of foreign breed. And we returned to our
inn full of admiration, and the two varlets said sorrowfully, `Why were
we born with two legs?' And one of the grooms that was civil and had of
me trinkgeld, stood now at his (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) cottage-door and asked us in. There we
found his (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) wife and children of all ages, from five to eighteen, and had
but one room to bide and sleep in, a thing pestiferous and most uncivil.
Then I asked my Servant, knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) this prince? Ay, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>), and had often
drunk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) in a marble chamber above the stable, where, for table,
was a curious and artificial rock, and the drinking vessels hang on its
pinnacles, and at the hottest of the engagement a statue of a horseman
in bronze came forth bearing a bowl of liquor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) that sat nearest
behoved to drain it. `'Tis well,' said I: `now for thy penance, whisper
thou in yon prince's ear, that God hath given him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) people freely, and
not sought a price for them as for horses. And pray him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) look inside the
huts at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) horse-palace door, and bethink himself is it well to house
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) horses, and stable his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) folk.' Said he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>), `'Twill give sore offence.'
`But,' said I, `ye must do it discreetly and choose your time.' So he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>)
promised. And riding on we heard plaintive cries. `Alas,' said I, `some
sore mischance hath befallen some poor soul: what may it be?' And we
rode up, and lo! it was a wedding feast, and the guests were plying the
business of drinking sad and silent, but ever and anon cried loud and
dolefully, `Seyte frolich! Be merry.'

<p/>``January 3.--Yesterday between Nurnberg and Augsburg we parted company.
I gave my lord, late Servant, back his (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) brave clothes for mine, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>)
horse he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) made me keep, and five gold pieces, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) was still my
debtor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) penance it had been slight along of me, but profitable. But
his (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) best word was this: `I see `tis more noble to be loved than feared.'
And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) did so praise me as I blushed to put on paper; yet, poor
fool, would fain thou couldst hear his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) words, but from some other pen
than mine. And the servants did heartily grasp my hand, and wish me good
luck. And riding apace, yet could I not reach Augsburg till the
gates were closed; but it mattered little, for this Augsburg it is
an enchanted city. For a small coin one took me a long way round to
a famous postern called der Einlasse. Here stood two guardians, like
statues. To them I gave my name and business. They nodded me leave to
knock; I knocked; and the iron gate opened with a great noise and hollow
rattling of a chain, but no hand seen nor chain; and he (<font color='blue'><b>guardians</b></font>) who drew the
hidden chain sits a butt's length from the gate; and I rode in, and the
gate closed with a clang after me. I found myself in a great building
with a bridge at my feet. This I rode over and presently came to a
porter's lodge, where one asked me again my name and business, then rang
a bell, and a great portcullis that barred the way began to rise, drawn
by a wheel overhead, and no hand seen. Behind the portcullis was a thick
oaken door studded with steel. It opened without hand, and I rode into a
hall as dark as pitch. Trembling there a while, a door opened and showed
me a smaller hall lighted. I rode into it: a tin goblet came down from
the ceiling by a little chain: I put two batzen into it, and it went
up again. Being gone, another thick door creaked and opened, and I
rid through. It closed on me with a tremendous clang, and behold me in
Augsburg city. I lay at an inn called `The Three Moors,' over an hundred
years old; and this morning, according to my way of viewing towns to
learn their compass and shape, I mounted the highest tower I could
find, and setting my dial at my foot surveyed the beautiful city: whole
streets of palaces and churches tiled with copper burnished like gold;
and the house fronts gaily painted and all glazed, and the glass so
clean and burnished as `tis most resplendent and rare; and I, now first
seeing a great city, did crow with delight, and like cock on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ladder,
and at the tower foot was taken into custody for a spy; for whilst I
watched the city the watchman had watched me. The burgomaster received
me courteously and heard my story; then rebuked he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) the officers. `Could
ye not question him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) yourselves, or read in his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) face? This is to make our
city stink in strangers' report.' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) told me my curiosity was of a
commendable sort; and seeing I was a craftsman and inquisitive, bade
his (<font color='blue'><b>craftsman</b></font>) clerk take me among the guilds. God bless the city where the very
burgomaster is cut of Soloman's cloth!

<p/>``January 5.--Dear Margaret, it is a noble city, and a kind mother to
arts. Here they cut in wood and ivory, that `tis like spider's work, and
paint on glass, and sing angelical harmonies. Writing of books is quite
gone by; here be six printers. Yet was I offered a bountiful wage to
write fairly a merchant's accounts, one Fugger, a grand and wealthy
trader, and hath store of ships, yet his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) father was but a poor weaver.
But here in commerce, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) very garden, men swell like mushrooms. And he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>)
bought my horse of me, and abated me not a jot, which way of dealing is
not known in Holland. But oh, Margaret, the workmen of all the guilds
are so kind and brotherly to one another, and to me. Here, methinks,
I have found the true German mind, loyal, frank, and kindly, somewhat
choleric withal, but nought revengeful. Each mechanic wears a sword. The
very weavers at the loom sit girded with their weapons, and all Germans
on too slight occasion draw them and fight; but no treachery: challenge
first, then draw, and with the edge only, mostly the face, not with Sir
Point; for if in these combats one thrust at his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) adversary and hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>),
`tis called ein schelemstucke, a heinous act, both men and women turn
their backs on him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>); and even the judges punish thrusts bitterly, but
pass over cuts. Hence in Germany be good store of scarred faces, three
in five at least, and in France scarce more than one in three.

<p/>``But in arts mechanical no citizens may compare with these. Fountains
in every street that play to heaven, and in the gardens seeming trees,
which being approached, one standing afar touches a spring, and
every twig shoots water, and souses the guests to their host's much
delectation. Big culverins of war they cast with no more ado than our
folk horse-shoes, and have done this fourscore years. All stuffs they
weave, and linen fine as ours at home, or nearly, which elsewhere
in Europe vainly shall ye seek. Sir Printing Press--sore foe to poor
Gerard, but to other humans beneficial--plieth by night and day, and
casteth goodly words like sower afield; while I, poor fool, can but sow
them as I saw women in France sow rye, dribbling it in the furrow grain
by grain. And of their strange mechanical skill take two examples. For
ending of exemplary rogues they have a figure like a woman, seven feet
high, and called Jung Frau; but lo, a spring is touched, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seizeth the
poor wretch with iron arms, and opening herself, hales him (<font color='blue'><b>Jung</b></font>) inside
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and there pierces him (<font color='blue'><b>Jung</b></font>) through and through with two score lances.
Secondly, in all great houses the spit is turned not by a scrubby boy,
but by smoke. Ay, mayst well admire, and judge me a lying knave. These
cunning Germans do set in the chimney a little windmill, and the smoke
struggling to wend past, turns it, and from the mill a wire runs through
the wall and turns the spit on wheels; beholding which I doffed my
bonnet to the men of Augsburg, for who but these had ere devised to bind
ye so dark and subtle a knave as Sir Smoke, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to roast Dame
Pullet?

<p/>``This day, January 8, with three craftsmen of the town, I painted a pack
of cards. They were for a senator, in a hurry. I the diamonds. My queen
came forth with eyes like spring violets, hair a golden brown, and
witching smile. My fellow-craftsmen saw her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), and put their arms round
my neck and hailed me master. Oh, noble Germans! No jealousy of a
brother-workman: no sour looks at a stranger; and would have me spend
Sunday with them after matins; and the merchant paid me so richly as I
was ashamed to take the guerdon; and I to my inn, and tried to paint
the queen of diamonds for poor Gerard; but no, she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) would not come like
again. Luck will not be bespoke. Oh, happy rich man that hath got her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>)!
Fie! fie! Happy Gerard that shall have herself one day, and keep house
with her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) at Augsburg.

<p/>``January 8.--With my fellows, and one Veit Stoss, a wood-carver, and
one Hafnagel, of the goldsmiths' guild, and their wives and lasses,
to Hafnagel's cousin, a senator of this free city, and his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) stupendous
wine-vessel. It is ribbed like a ship, and hath been eighteen months in
hand, and finished but now, and holds a hundred and fifty hogsheads, and
standeth not, but lieth; yet even so ye get not on his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) back, withouten
ladders two, of thirty steps. And we sat about the miraculous mass, and
drank Rhenish from it, drawn by a little artificial pump, and the lasses
pinned their crantzes to it, and we danced round it, and the senator
danced on its back, but with drinking of so many garausses, lost his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>)
footing and fell off, glass in hand, and broke an arm and a leg in the
midst of us. So scurvily ended our drinking bout for this time.

<p/>``January 10.--This day started for Venice with a company of merchants,
and among them him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) who had desired me for his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) scrivener; and so we are
now agreed, I to write at night the letters he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) shall dict, and other
matters, he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) to feed and lodge me on the road. We be many and armed, and
soldiers with us to boot, so fear not the thieves which men say lie on
the borders of Italy. But an if I find the printing press at Venice, I
trow I shall not go unto Rome, for man may not vie with iron.

<p/>``Imprimit una dies quantum non scribitur anno. And, dearest, something
tells me you and I shall end our days at Augsburg, whence going, I shall
leave it all I can--my blessing.

<p/>``January 12.--My master affecteth me much, and now maketh me sit with
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) horse-litter. A grave good man, of all respected, but sad
for loss of a dear daughter, and loveth my psaltery: not giddy-faced
ditties, but holy harmonies such as Cul de Jatte made wry mouths at. So
many men, so many minds. But cooped in horse-litter and at night writing
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) letters, my journal halteth.

<p/>``January 14.--When not attending on my good merchant, I consort with
such of our company as are Italians, for `tis to Italy I wend, and I
am ill seen in Italian tongue. A courteous and a subtle people, at meat
delicate feeders and cleanly: love not to put their left hand in the
dish. They say Venice is the garden of Lombardy, Lombardy the garden of
Italy, Italy of the world.

<p/>``January 16.-Strong ways and steep, and the mountain girls so girded up,
as from their armpits to their waist is but a handful. Of all the garbs
I yet have seen, the most unlovely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``January 18.-In the midst of life we are in death. Oh! dear Margaret,
I thought I had lost thee. Here I lie in pain and dole, and shall
write thee that, which read you it in a romance ye should cry, `Most
improbable!' And so still wondering that I am alive to write it, and
thanking for it God and the saints, this is what befell thy Gerard.
Yestreen I wearied of being shut up in litter, and of the mule's slow
pace, and so went forward; and being, I know not why, strangely full
of spirit and hope, as I have heard befall some men when on trouble's
brink, seemed to tread on air, and soon distanced them all. Presently I
came to two roads, and took the larger; I should have taken the smaller.
After travelling a good half-hour, I found my error, and returned; and
deeming my company had long passed by, pushed bravely on, but I could
not overtake them; and small wonder, as you shall hear. Then I was
anxious, and ran, but bare was the road of those I sought; and night
came down, and the wild beasts a-foot, and I bemoaned my folly; also I
was hungered. The moon rose clear and bright exceedingly, and presently
a little way off the road I saw a tall windmill. `Come,' said I, `mayhap
the miller will take ruth on me.' Near the mill was a haystack, and
scattered about were store of little barrels; but lo they were not
flour-barrels, but tar-barrels, one or two, and the rest of spirits,
Brant vein and Schiedam; I knew them momently, having seen the like in
Holland. I knocked at the mill-door, but none answered. I lifted the
latch, and the door opened inwards. I went in, and gladly, for the night
was fine but cold, and a rime on the trees, which were a kind of lofty
sycamores. There was a stove, but black; I lighted it with some of the
hay and wood, for there was a great pile of wood outside, and I know
not how, I went to sleep. Not long had I slept, I trow, when hearing a
noise, I awoke; and there were a dozen men around me, with wild faces,
and long black hair, and black sparkling eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my poor boy! those black-haired ones do still scare me
to look on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I made my excuses in such Italian as I knew, and eking out by
signs. They grinned. `I had lost my company.' They grinned. `I was an
hungered.' Still they grinned, and spoke to one another in a tongue I
knew not. At last one gave me a piece of bread and a tin mug of wine,
as I thought, but it was spirits neat. I made a wry face and asked for
water: then these wild men laughed a horrible laugh. I thought to fly,
but looking towards the door it was bolted with two enormous bolts of
iron, and now first, as I ate my bread, I saw it was all guarded too,
and ribbed with iron. My blood curdled within me, and yet I could
not tell thee why; but hadst thou seen the faces, wild, stupid, and
ruthless. I mumbled my bread, not to let them see I feared them; but oh,
it cost me to swallow it and keep it in me. Then it whirled in my brain,
was there no way to escape? Said I, `They will not let me forth by
the door; these be smugglers or robbers.' So I feigned drowsiness, and
taking out two batzen said, `Good men, for our Lady's grace let me lie
on a bed and sleep, for I am faint with travel.' They nodded and grinned
their horrible grin, and bade one light a lanthorn and lead me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) took
me up a winding staircase, up, up, and I saw no windows, but the wooden
walls were pierced like a barbican tower, and methinks for the same
purpose, and through these slits I got glimpses of the sky, and thought,
`Shall I e'er see thee again?' He (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) took me to the very top of the mill,
and there was a room with a heap of straw in one corner and many empty
barrels, and by the wall a truckle bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) pointed to it, and went
downstairs heavily, taking the light, for in this room was a great
window, and the moon came in bright. I looked out to see, and lo, it
was so high that even the mill sails at their highest came not up to my
window by some feet, but turned very slow and stately underneath, for
wind there was scarce a breath; and the trees seemed silver filagree
made by angel craftsmen. My hope of flight was gone.

<p/>``But now, those wild faces being out of sight, I smiled at my fears:
what an if they were ill men, would it profit them to hurt me?
Natheless, for caution against surprise, I would put the bed against the
door. I went to move it, but could not. It was free at the head, but at
the foot fast clamped with iron to the floor. So I flung my psaltery on
the bed, but for myself made a layer of straw at the door, so as none
could open on me unawares. And I laid my sword ready to my hand. And
said my prayers for thee and me, and turned to sleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Below they drank and made merry. And hearing this gave me confidence.
Said I, `Out of sight, out of mind. Another hour and the good Schiedam
will make them forget that I am here.' And so I composed myself to
sleep. And for some time could not for the boisterous mirth below.
At last I dropped off. How long I slept I knew not; but I woke with a
start: the noise had ceased below, and the sudden silence woke me. And
scarce was I awake, when sudden the truckle bed was gone with a loud
clang all but the feet, and the floor yawned, and I heard my psaltery
fall and break to atoms, deep, deep, below the very floor of the mill.
It had fallen into a well. And so had I done, lying where it lay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret shuddered and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands. But speedily resumed.

<p/>``I lay stupefied at first. Then horror fell on me, and I rose, but stood
rooted there, shaking from head to foot. At last I found myself looking
down into that fearsome gap, and my very hair did bristle as I peered.
And then, I remember, I turned quite calm, and made up my mind to die
sword in hand. For I saw no man must know this their bloody secret and
live. And I said, `Poor Margaret!' And I took out of my bosom, where
they lie ever, our marriage lines, and kissed them again and again. And
I pinned them to my shirt again, that they might lie in one grave with
me, if die I must. And I thought, `All our love and hopes to end thus!'''

<p/>Eli. <div class="bookquote">``Whisht all! Their marriage lines? Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) time! But no word. I
can bear no chat. My poor lad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>During the long pause that ensued Catherine leaned forward and passed
something adroitly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own lap under her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter's apron who sat
next her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/>``Presently thinking, all in a whirl, of all that ever passed between us,
and taking leave of all those pleasant hours, I called to mind how one
day at Sevenbergen thou taughtest me to make a rope of straw. Mindest
thou? The moment memory brought that happy day back to me, I cried out
very loud: `Margaret gives me a chance for life even here.' I woke from
my lethargy. I seized on the straw and twisted it eagerly, as thou didst
teach me, but my fingers trembled and delayed the task. Whiles I wrought
I heard a door open below. That was a terrible moment. Even as I twisted
my rope I got to the window and looked down at the great arms of the
mill coming slowly up, then passing, then turning less slowly down, as
it seemed; and I thought, `They go not as when there is wind: yet, slow
or fast, what man rid ever on such steed as these, and lived. Yet,' said
I, `better trust to them and God than to ill men.' And I prayed to Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
whom even the wind obeyeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Margaret, I fastened my rope, and let myself gently down, and
fixed my eye on that huge arm of the mill, which then was creeping up
to me, and went to spring on to it. But my heart failed me at the pinch.
And methought it was not near enow. And it passed calm and awful by. I
watched for another; they were three. And after a little while one crept
up slower than the rest methought. And I with my foot thrust myself in
good time somewhat out from the wall, and crying aloud `Margaret!' did
grip with all my soul the wood-work of the sail, and that moment was
swimming in the air.''

the grass came up to me nearer and nearer, and when the hoary grass was
quite close I was sent rolling along it as if hurled from a catapult,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And e'en as I lay groaning, I heard a sound like thunder. It was the
assassins running up the stairs. The crazy old mill shook under them.
They must have found that I had not fallen into their bloody trap, and
were running to despatch me. Margaret, I felt no fear, for I had now
no hope. I could neither run nor hide; so wild the place, so bright the
moon. I struggled up all agony and revenge, more like some wounded wild
beast than your Gerard. Leaning on my sword hilt I hobbled round; and
swift as lighting, or vengeance, I heaped a great pile of their hay
and wood at the mill door; then drove my dagger into a barrel of their
smuggled spirits, and flung it on; then out with my tinder and lighted
the pile. `This will bring true men round my dead body,' said I.
`Aha!' I cried, `think you I'll die alone, cowards, assassins! reckless
fiends!' and at each word on went a barrel pierced. But oh, Margaret!
the fire fed by the spirits surprised me: it shot up and singed my
very hair, it went roaring up the side of the mill, swift as falls
the lightning; and I yelled and laughed in my torture and despair, and
pierced more barrels and the very tar-barrels, and flung them on. The
fire roared like a lion for its prey, and voices answered it inside from
the top of the mill, and the feet came thundering down, and I stood
as near that awful fire as I could, with uplifted sword to slay and
be slain. The bolt was drawn. A tar-barrel caught fire. The door was
opened. What followed? Not the men came out, but the fire rushed in
at them like a living death, and the first I thought to fight with was
blackened and crumpled on the floor like a leaf. One fearsome yell, and
dumb for ever. The feet ran up again, but fewer. I heard them hack with
their swords a little way up at the mill's wooden sides; but they had
no time to hew their way out: the fire and reek were at their heels, and
the smoke burst out at every loophole, and oozed blue in the moonlight
through each crevice. I hobbled back, racked with pain and fury. There
were white faces up at my window. They saw me. They cursed me. I cursed
them back and shook my naked sword: `Come down the road I came,' I
cried. `But ye must come one by one, and as ye come, ye die upon this
steel.' Some cursed at that, but others wailed. For I had them all at
deadly vantage. And doubtless, with my smoke-grimed face and fiendish
rage, I looked a demon. And now there was a steady roar inside the mill.
The flame was going up it as furnace up its chimney. The mill caught
fire. Fire glimmered through it. Tongues of flame darted through each
loophole and shot sparks and fiery flakes into the night. One of the
assassins leaped on to the sail, as I had done. In his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) hurry he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) missed
his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) grasp and fell at my feet, and bounded from the hard ground like
a ball, and never spoke, nor moved again. And the rest screamed like
women, and with their despair came back to me both ruth for them and
hope of life for myself. And the fire gnawed through the mill in placen,
and shot forth showers of great flat sparks like flakes of fiery snow;
and the sails caught fire one after another; and I became a man again
and staggered away terror-stricken, leaning on my sword, from the sight
of my revenge, and with great bodily pain crawled back to the road.
And, dear Margaret, the rimy trees were now all like pyramids of
golden filagree, and lace, cobweb fine, in the red firelight. Oh! most
beautiful! And a poor wretch got entangled in the burning sails, and
whirled round screaming, and lost hold at the wrong time, and hurled
like stone from mangonel high into the air; then a dull thump; it was
his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) carcass striking the earth. The next moment there was a loud crash.
The mill fell in on its destroyer, and a million great sparks flew up,
and the sails fell over the burning wreck, and at that a million more
sparks flew up, and the ground was strewn with burning wood and men. I
prayed God forgive me, and kneeling with my back to that fiery shambles,
I saw lights on the road; a welcome sight. It was a company coming
towards me, and scarce two furlongs off. I hobbled towards them. Ere I
had gone far I heard a swift step behind me. I turned. One had escaped;
how escaped, who can divine? His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sword shone in the moonlight. I feared
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Methought the ghosts of all those dead sat on that glittering
glaive. I put my other foot to the ground, maugre the anguish, and fled
towards the torches, moaning with pain, and shouting for aid. But what
could I do He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gained on me. Behooved me turn and fight. Denys had taught
me sword play in sport. I wheeled, our swords clashed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) clothes
they smelled all singed. I cut swiftly upward with supple hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
dangled bleeding at the wrist, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sword fell; it tinkled on the
ground. I raised my sword to hew him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) should he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) stoop for't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) stood
and cursed me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) dagger with his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) left; I opposed my point and
dared him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) with my eye to close. A great shout arose behind me from true
men's throats. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) started. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) spat at me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) rage, then gnashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
teeth and fled blaspheming. I turned and saw torches close at hand.
Lo, they fell to dancing up and down methought, and the
next-moment-all-was-dark. I had--ah!''

<p/>CHAPTER LIV

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) recovered, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head was on Catherine's arm, and the honest half
of the family she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had invaded like a foe stood round her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) uttering rough
homely words of encouragement, especially Giles, who roared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was not to take on like that. <div class="bookquote">``Gerard was alive and well, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
could not have writ this letter, the biggest mankind had seen as yet,
and,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``the beautifullest, and most moving, and smallest
writ.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, good Master Giles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>sighed Margaret feebly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was alive. But how
know I what hath since befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)? Oh, why left he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) Holland to go among
strangers fierce as lions? And why did I not drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) from me sooner
than part him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) own flesh and blood? Forgive me, you that are his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gently removed Catherine's arm, and made a feeble attempt to
slide off the chair on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knees, which, after a brief struggle with
superior force, ended in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) finding herself on Catherine's bosom. Then
Margaret held out the letter to Eli, and said faintly but sweetly, <div class="bookquote">``I
will trust it from my hand now. In sooth, I am little fit to read any
more-and-and--loth to leave my comfort;''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wreathed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) other arm
round Catherine's neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read thou, Richart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli: <div class="bookquote">``thine eyes be younger than mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>Richart took the letter. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``such writing saw I never. A
writeth with a needle's point; and clear to boot. Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) not in my
counting-house at Amsterdam instead of vagabonding it out yonder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I came to myself I was seated in the litter, and my good merchant
holding of my hand. I babbled I know not what, and then shuddered awhile
in silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) put a horn of wine to my lips.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Bless him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>)! bless him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli. <div class="bookquote">``Whisht!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And I told him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) what had befallen. He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) would see my leg. It was sprained
sore, and swelled at the ankle; and all my points were broken, as I
could scarce keep up my hose, and I said, `Sir, I shall be but a burden
to you, I doubt, and can make you no harmony now; my poor psaltery it
is broken;' and I did grieve over my broken music, companion of so many
weary leagues. But he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) patted me on the cheek, and bade me not fret; also
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) did put up my leg on a pillow, and tended me like a kind father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``January 19.--I sit all day in the litter, for we are pushing forward
with haste, and at night the good, kind merchant sendeth me to bed, and
will not let me work. Strange! whene’er I fall in with men like fiends,
then the next moment God still sendeth me some good man or woman, lest I
should turn away from human kind. Oh, Margaret! how strangely mixed they
be, and how old I am by what I was three months agone. And lo! if good
Master Fugger hath not been and bought me a psaltery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Eli, my man, an yon merchant comes our way let us buy a
hundred ells of cloth of him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>), and not higgle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli. <div class="bookquote">``That will I, take your oath on't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richart</b></font>)</div><p/>While Richart prepared to read, Kate looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mother, and with a
faint blush drew out the piece of work from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) apron, and sewed
with head depressed a little more than necessary. On this her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) mother
drew a piece of work out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) pocket, and sewed too, while Richart
read. Both the specimens these sweet surreptitious creatures now first
exposed to observation were babies' caps, and more than half finished,
which told a tale. Horror! they were like little monks' cowls in shape
and delicacy.

<p/>``January 20.--Laid up in the litter, and as good as blind, but halting
to bait, Lombardy plains burst on me. Oh, Margaret! a land flowing
with milk and honey; all sloping plains, goodly rivers, jocund meadows,
delectable orchards, and blooming gardens; and though winter, looks
warmer than poor beloved Holland at midsummer, and makes the wanderer's
face to shine, and his (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) heart to leap for joy to see earth so kind and
smiling. Here be vines, cedars, olives, and cattle plenty, but three
goats to a sheep. The draught oxen wear white linen on their necks, and
standing by dark green olive-trees each one is a picture; and the folk,
especially women, wear delicate strawen hats with flowers and leaves
fairly imitated in silk, with silver mixed. This day we crossed a river
prettily in a chained ferry-boat. On either bank was a windlass, and a
single man by turning of it drew our whole company to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shore, whereat
I did admire, being a stranger. Passed over with us some country folk.
And an old woman looking at a young wench, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did hide her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face with
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crucifix out like knight his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword in tourney
dreading the evil eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``January 25.--Safe at Venice. A place whose strange and passing beauty
is well known to thee by report of our mariners. Dost mind too how Peter
would oft fill our ears withal, we handed beneath the table, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
still discoursing of this sea-enthroned and peerless city, in shape a
bow, and its great canal and palaces on piles, and its watery ways plied
by scores of gilded boats; and that market-place of nations, orbis,
non urbis, forum, St. Mark, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) place? And his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) statue with the peerless
jewels in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) eyes, and the lion at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) gate? But I, lying at my window
in pain, may see none of these beauties as yet, but only a street,
fairly paved, which is dull, and houses with oiled paper and linen,
in lieu of glass, which is rude; and the passers-by, their habits and
their gestures, wherein they are superfluous. Therefore, not to miss my
daily comfort of whispering to thee, I will e'en turn mine eyes inward,
and bind my sheaves of wisdom reaped by travel. For I love thee so, that
no treasure pleases me not shared with thee; and what treasure so good
and enduring as knowledge? This then have I, Sir Footsore, learned, that
each nation hath its proper wisdom, and its proper folly; and methinks,
could a great king, or duke, tramp like me, and see with his (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) own eyes,
he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) might pick the flowers, and eschew the weeds of nations, and go home
and set his (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) own folk on Wisdom's hill. The Germans in the north were
churlish, but frank and honest; in the south, kindly and honest too.
Their general blot is drunkenness, the which they carry even to mislike
and contempt of sober men. They say commonly, `Kanstu niecht sauffen und
fressen so kanstu kienem hern wol dienen.' In England, the vulgar sort
drink as deep, but the worshipful hold excess in this a reproach, and
drink a health or two for courtesy, not gluttony, and still sugar the
wine. In their cups the Germans use little mirth or discourse, but ply
the business sadly, crying `Seyte frolich!' The best of their drunken
sport is `Kurlemurlehuff,' a way of drinking with touching deftly of the
glass, the beard, the table, in due turn, intermixed with whistlings
and snappings of the finger so curiously ordered as `tis a labour of
Hercules, but to the beholder right pleasant and mirthful. Their topers,
by advice of German leeches, sleep with pebbles in their mouths. For,
as of a boiling pot the lid must be set ajar, so with these fleshy
wine-pots, to vent the heat of their inward parts: spite of which many
die suddenly from drink; but `tis a matter of religion to slur it, and
gloze it, and charge some innocent disease therewith. Yet `tis more a
custom than very nature, for their women come among the tipplers, and
do but stand a moment, and as it were, kiss the wine-cup; and are indeed
most temperate in eating and drinking, and of all women, modest and
virtuous, and true spouses and friends to their mates; far before our
Holland lasses, that being maids, put the question to the men, and being
wived, do lord it over them. Why, there is a wife in Tergou, not far
from our door. One came to the house and sought her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) man. Says she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
`You'll not find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked my leave to go abroad this afternoon, and
I did give it him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).'''

<p/>Catherine. ```Tis sooth! `tis sooth! `Twas Beck Hulse, Jonah's wife. This
comes of a woman wedding a boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the south where wine is, the gentry drink themselves bare; but not
in the north: for with beer a noble shall sooner burst his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) body than
melt his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) lands. They are quarrelsome, but `tis the liquor, not the mind;
for they are none revengeful. And when they have made a bad bargain
drunk, they stand to it sober. They keep their windows bright; and
judge a man by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes. Whatever fruit or grain or herb grows by the
roadside, gather and eat. The owner seeing you shall say, `Art welcome,
honest man.' But an ye pluck a wayside grape, your very life is in
jeopardy. `Tis eating of that Heaven gave to be drunken. The French are
much fairer spoken, and not nigh so true-hearted. Sweet words cost them
nought. They call it payer en blanche.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys. <div class="bookquote">``Les coquins! ha! ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Natheless, courtesy is in their hearts, ay, in their very blood. They
say commonly, `Give yourself the trouble of sitting down.' And such
straws of speech show how blows the wind. Also at a public show, if you
would leave your seat, yet not lose it, tie but your napkin round the
bench, and no French man or woman will sit here; but rather keep the
place for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Gramercy! that is manners. France for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys rose and placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hand gracefully to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) breastplate.

<p/>``Natheless, they say things in sport which are not courteous, but
shocking. `Le diable t’emporte!' `Allez au diable!' and so forth. But
I trow they mean not such dreadful wishes: custom belike. Moderate in
drinking, and mix water with their wine, and sing and dance over their
cups, and are then enchanting company. They are curious not to drink
in another man's cup. In war the English gain the better of them in the
field; but the French are their masters in attack and defence of cities;
witness Orleans, where they besieged their besiegers and hashed them
sore with their double and treble culverines; and many other sieges in
this our century. More than all nations they flatter their women, and
despise them. No. She (<font color='blue'><b>French</b></font>) may be their sovereign ruler. Also they often hang
their female malefactors, instead of drowning them decently, as other
nations use. The furniture in their inns is walnut, in Germany only
deal. French windows are ill. The lower half is of wood, and opens; the
upper half is of glass, but fixed; so that the servant cannot come at
it to clean it. The German windows are all glass, and movable, and shine
far and near like diamonds. In France many mean houses are not glazed
at all. Once I saw a Frenchman pass a church without unbonneting. This
I ne’er witnessed in Holland, Germany, or Italy. At many inns they show
the traveller his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) sheets, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) assurance they are clean, and warm
them at the fire before him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>); a laudable custom. They receive him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) kindly
and like a guest; they mostly cheat him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>), and whiles cut his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) throat.
They plead in excuse hard and tyrannous laws. And true it is their law
thrusteth its nose into every platter, and its finger into every pie.
In France worshipful men wear their hats and their furs indoors, and
go abroad lighter clad. In Germany they don hat and furred cloak to go
abroad; but sit bareheaded and light clad round the stove.

<p/>``The French intermix not the men and women folk in assemblies, as we
Hollanders use. Round their preachers the women sit on their heels in
rows, and the men stand behind them. Their harvests are rye, and flax,
and wine. Three mules shall you see to one horse, and whole flocks of
sheep as black as coal.

<p/>``In Germany the snails be red. I lie not. The French buy minstrelsy,
but breed jests, and make their own mirth. The Germans foster their set
fools, with ear-caps, which move them to laughter by simulating madness;
a calamity that asks pity, not laughter. In this particular I deem that
lighter nation wiser than the graver German. What sayest thou? Alas!
canst not answer me now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In Germany the petty laws are wondrous wise and just. Those against
criminals, bloody. In France bloodier still; and executed a trifle more
cruelly there. Here the wheel is common, and the fiery stake; and under
this king they drown men by the score in Paris river, Seine yclept. But
the English are as peremptory in hanging and drowning for a light fault;
so travellers report. Finally, a true-hearted Frenchman, when ye chance
on one, is a man as near perfect as earth affords; and such a man is my
Denys, spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) foul mouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys. <div class="bookquote">``My foul mouth! Is that so writ, Master Richart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richart</b></font>)</div><p/>Richart. <div class="bookquote">``Ay, in sooth; see else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys -LRB-inspecting the letter gravely-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``I read not the letter so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richart</b></font>)</div><p/>Richart. <div class="bookquote">``How then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys. <div class="bookquote">``Humph! ahem why just the contrary.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) added: ```Tis kittle work
perusing of these black scratches men are agreed to take for words. And
I trow `tis still by guess you clerks do go, worthy sir. My foul mouth!
This is the first time e'er I heard on't. Eh, mesdames?''

<p/>But the females did not seize the opportunity he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) gave them, and burst
into a loud and general disclaimer. Margaret blushed and said nothing;
the other two bent silently over their work with something very like a
sly smile. Denys inspected their countenances long and carefully. And
the perusal was so satisfactory, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) turned with a tone of injured,
but patient innocence, and bade Richart read on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Italians are a polished and subtle people. They judge a man, not by
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) habits, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speech and gesture. Here Sir Chough may by no
means pass for falcon gentle, as did I in Germany, pranked in my noble
servant's feathers. Wisest of all nations in their singular temperance
of food and drink. Most foolish of all to search strangers coming into
their borders, and stay them from bringing much money in. They should
rather invite it, and like other nations, let the traveller from taking
of it out. Also here in Venice the dames turn their black hair yellow by
the sun and art, to be wiser than Him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) who made them. Ye enter no Italian
town without a bill of health, though now is no plague in Europe. This
peevishness is for extortion's sake. The innkeepers cringe and fawn, and
cheat, and in country places murder you. Yet will they give you clean
sheets by paying therefor. Delicate in eating, and abhor from putting
their hand in the plate; sooner they will apply a crust or what not.
They do even tell of a cardinal at Rome, which armeth his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) guest's left
hand with a little bifurcal dagger to hold the meat, while his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) knife
cutteth it. But methinks this, too, is to be wiser than Him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), who made
the hand so supple and prehensile.''

cheese over them; O, perversity! Their salt is black; without a lie. In
commerce these Venetians are masters of the earth and sea; and govern
their territories wisely. Only one flaw I find; the same I once heard
a learned friar cast up against Plato his (<font color='blue'><b>Plato</b></font>) republic: to wit, that here
women are encouraged to venal frailty, and do pay a tax to the State,
which, not content with silk and spice, and other rich and honest
freights, good store, must trade in sin. Twenty thousand of these
Jezebels there be in Venice and Candia, and about, pampered and honoured
for bringing strangers to the city, and many live in princely palaces of
their own. But herein methinks the politic signors of Venice forget what
King David saith, `Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh
but in vain.' Also, in religion, they hang their cloth according to the
wind, siding now with the Pope, now with the Turk; but aye with the god
of traders, mammon hight. Shall flower so cankered bloom to the world's
end? But since I speak of flowers, this none may deny them, that they
are most cunning in making roses and gilliflowers to blow unseasonably.
In summer they nip certain of the budding roses and water them not. Then
in winter they dig round these discouraged plants, and put in cloves;
and so with great art rear sweet-scented roses, and bring them to market
in January. And did first learn this art of a cow. Buds she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) grazed in
summer, and they sprouted at yule. Women have sat in the doctors' chairs
at their colleges. But she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) that sat in St. Peter's was a German. Italy
too, for artful fountains and figures that move by water and enact life.
And next for fountains is Augsburg, where they harness the foul knave
Smoke to good Sir Spit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) turneth stout Master Roast. But lest any
one place should vaunt, two towns there be in Europe, which, scorning
giddy fountains, bring water tame in pipes to every burgher's door, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>burgher</b></font>) filleth his (<font color='blue'><b>burgher</b></font>) vessels with but turning of a cock. One is London,
so watered this many a year by pipes of a league from Paddington, a
neighbouring city; and the other is the fair town of Lubeck. Also the
fierce English are reported to me wise in that they will not share their
land and flocks with wolves; but have fairly driven those marauders into
their mountains. But neither in France, nor Germany, nor Italy, is a
wayfarer's life safe from the vagabones after sundown. I can hear of no
glazed house in all Venice; but only oiled linen and paper; and behind
these barbarian eyelets, a wooden jalosy. Their name for a cowardly
assassin is `a brave man,' and for an harlot, `a courteous person,'
which is as much as to say that a woman's worst vice, and a man's worst
vice, are virtues. But I pray God for little Holland that there an
assassin may be yclept an assassin, and an harlot an harlot, till
domesday; and then gloze foul faults with silken names who can!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``January 26.--Sweetheart, I must be brief, and tell thee but a part of
that I have seen, for this day my journal ends. To-night it sails for
thee, and I, unhappy, not with it, but to-morrow, in another ship, to
Rome.

<p/>``Dear Margaret, I took a hand litter, and was carried to St. Mark his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)
church. Outside it, towards the market-place, is a noble gallery, and
above it four famous horses, cut in brass by the ancient Romans, and
seem all moving, and at the very next step must needs leap down on the
beholder. About the church are six hundred pillars of marble, porphyry,
and ophites. Inside is a treasure greater than either, at St. Denys,
or Loretto, or Toledo. Here a jewelled pitcher given the seigniory by a
Persian king, also the ducal cap blazing with jewels, and on its crown
a diamond and a chrysolite, each as big as an almond; two golden crowns
and twelve golden stomachers studded with jewels, from Constantinople;
item, a monstrous sapphire; item, a great diamond given by a French
king; item, a prodigious carbuncle; item, three unicorns' horns. But
what are these compared with the sacred relics?

<p/>``Dear Margaret, I stood and saw the brazen chest that holds the body of
St. Mark the Evangelist. I saw with these eyes and handled his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) ring, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) gospel written with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) own hand, and all my travels seemed light;
for who am I that I should see such things? Dear Margaret, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) sacred
body was first brought from Alexandria, by merchants in 810, and then
not prized as now; for between 829, when this church was builded, and
1094, the very place where it lay was forgotten. Then holy priests
fasted and prayed many days seeking for light, and lo! the Evangelist's
body brake at midnight through the marble and stood before them. They
fell to the earth; but in the morning found the crevice the sacred body
had burst through, and peering through it saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) lie. Then they took
and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) chest beneath the altar, and carefully put back the
stone with its miraculous crevice, which crevice I saw, and shall gape
for a monument while the world lasts. After that they showed me the
Virgin's chair, it is of stone; also her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) picture, painted by St. Luke,
very dark, and the features now scarce visible. This picture, in time of
drought, they carry in procession, and brings the rain. I wish I had
not seen it. Item, two pieces of marble spotted with John the Baptist's
blood; item, a piece of the true cross, and of the pillar to which
Christ was tied; item, the rock struck by Moses, and wet to this hour;
also a stone Christ sat on, preaching at Tyre; but some say it is the
one the patriarch Jacob laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) head on, and I hold with them, by
reason our Lord never preached at Tyre. Going hence, they showed me
the state nursery for the children of those aphrodisian dames, their
favourites. Here in the outer wall was a broad niche, and if they bring
them so little as they can squeeze them through it alive, the bairn
falls into a net inside, and the state takes charge of it, but if too
big, their mothers must even take them home again, with whom abiding
`tis like to be mali corvi mali ovum. Coming out of the church we met
them carrying in a corpse, with the feet and face bare. This I then
first learned is Venetian custom, and sure no other town will ever rob
them of it, nor of this that follows. On a great porphyry slab in the
piazza were three ghastly heads rotting and tainting the air, and in
their hot summers like to take vengeance with breeding of a plague.
These were traitors to the state, and a heavy price--two thousand
ducats--being put on each head, their friends had slain them and brought
all three to the slab, and so sold blood of others and their own faith.
No state buys heads so many, nor pays half so high a price for that
sorry merchandise. But what I most admired was to see over against the
Duke's palace a fair gallows in alabaster, reared express to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>),
and no other, for the least treason to the state; and there it stands in
his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) eye whispering him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) memento mori. I pondered, and owned these signors
my masters, who will let no man, not even their sovereign, be above the
common weal. Hard by, on a wall, the workmen were just finishing, by
order of the seigniory, the stone effigy of a tragical and enormous act
enacted last year, yet on the wall looks innocent. Here two gentle folks
whisper together, and there other twain, their swords by their side.
Four brethren were they, which did on either side conspire to poison the
other two, and so halve their land in lieu of quartering it; and at a
mutual banquet these twain drugged the wine, and those twain envenomed a
marchpane, to such good purpose that the same afternoon lay four `brave
men' around one table grovelling in mortal agony, and cursing of one
another and themselves, and so concluded miserably, and the land, for
which they had lost their immortal souls, went into another family. And
why not? it could not go into a worse.

<p/>``But O, sovereign wisdom of bywords! how true they put the finger on
each nation's, or particular's, fault.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quand Italie sera sans poison
Et France sans trahison
Et l’Angleterre sans guerre,
Lors sera le monde sans terre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richart</b></font>)</div><p/>Richart explained this to Catherine, then proceeded: ``And after this
they took me to the quay, and presently I espied among the masts one
garlanded with amaranth flowers. `Take me thither,' said I, and I let
my guide know the custom of our Dutch skippers to hoist flowers to
the masthead when they are courting a maid. Oft had I scoffed at this
saying, `So then his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wooing is the earth's concern. But now, so far from
the Rotter, that bunch at a masthead made my heart leap with assurance
of a countryman. They carried me, and oh, Margaret! on the stern of that
Dutch boy, was written in muckle letters,

<p/>RICHART ELIASSOEN, AMSTERDAM.

<p/>`Put me down,' I said; `for our Lady's sake put me down.' I sat on the
bank and looked, scarce believing my eyes, and looked, and presently
fell to crying, till I could see the words no more. Ah me, how they went
to my heart, those bare letters in a foreign land. Dear Richart! good,
kind brother Richart! often I have sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knee and rid on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) back.
Kisses many he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has given me, unkind word from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had I never. And there
was his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) name on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own ship, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face and all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) grave, but good
and gentle ways, came back to me, and I sobbed vehemently, and cried
aloud, `Why, why is not brother Richart here, and not his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) name only?' I
spake in Dutch, for my heart was too full to hold their foreign tongues,
and

<p/>Eli. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Richart, go on, lad, prithee go on. Is this a place to halt
at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richart</b></font>)</div><p/>Richart. <div class="bookquote">``Father, with my duty to you, it is easy to say go on, but
think ye I am not flesh and blood? The poor boy's--simple grief and

 (<font color='red'><b>Richart</b></font>)</div><p/>Richart. <div class="bookquote">``Poor little curly-headed lad, what had he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) done that we have

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I would fain know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine drily, then fell to

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kind dame, good friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret trembling, <div class="bookquote">``let me tell you

our Gerard found breath to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was worthy Master Richart's brother.
Thereat was the good skipper all agog to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Richart. <div class="bookquote">``So! so! skipper! Master Richart aforesaid will be at thy

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) told Gerard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) consort that was to sail that

letter and bring it to the ship. And the rest, it is but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) poor dear
words of love to me, the which, an't please you, I think shame to hear
them read aloud, and ends with the lines I sent to Mistress Kate, and
they would sound so harsh now and ungrateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richart</b></font>)</div><p/>The pleading tone, as much as the words, prevailed, and Richart said he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
would read no more aloud, but run his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) eye over it for his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) own brotherly
satisfaction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) blushed and looked uneasy, but made no reply.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine bustled out to prepare supper. Eli and Richart sat down and
concocted a letter to bring Gerard home. Richart promised it should go
by sea to Rome that very week. Sybrandt and Cornelis exchanged a gloomy
wink, and stole out. Margaret, seeing Giles deep in meditation, for the
dwarf's intelligence had taken giant strides, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) the
letter. <div class="bookquote">``You have heard but half, good master Giles,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Shall I
read you the rest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be much beholden to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>shouted the sonorous atom.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) stool: curiosity bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) pride to sit on it; and
Margaret murmured the first part of the letter into his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) ear very low,
not to disturb Eli and Richart. And to do this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) leaned forward and
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lovely face cheek by jowl with Giles's hideous one: a strange
contrast, and worth a painter's while to try and represent. And in this
attitude Catherine found her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and all the mother warmed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exchanged an eloquent glance with little Kate.

<p/>The latter smiled, and sewed, with drooping lashes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) home on the instant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>roared Giles. <div class="bookquote">``I'll make a man of him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LV

<p/>About two months before this scene in Eli's home, the natives of a
little' maritime place between Naples and Rome might be seen flocking to
the sea beach, with eyes cast seaward at a ship, that laboured against a
stiff gale blowing dead on the shore.

<p/>At times she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed likely to weather the danger, and then the
spectators congratulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aloud: at others the wind and sea drove
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) visibly nearer, and the lookers-on were not without a secret
satisfaction they would not have owned even to themselves.

<p/>Non quia vexari quemquam est jucunda voluptas
Sed quibus ipse malis careas quia cernere suave est..

<p/>And the poor ship, though not scientifically built for sailing, was
admirably constructed for going ashore, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) extravagant poop that
caught the wind, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lines like a cocked hat reversed. To those
on the beach that battered labouring frame of wood seemed alive, and
struggling against death with a panting heart. But could they have been
transferred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) deck they would have seen she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not one beating
heart but many, and not one nature but a score were coming out clear in
that fearful hour.

<p/>The mariners stumbled wildly about the deck, handling the ropes as each
thought fit, and cursing and praying alternately.

<p/>The passengers were huddled together round the mast, some sitting, some
kneeling, some lying prostrate, and grasping the bulwarks as the vessel
rolled and pitched in the mighty waves. One comely young man, whose ashy
cheek, but compressed lips, showed how hard terror was battling in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
with self-respect, stood a little apart, holding tight by a shroud, and
wincing at each sea. It was the ill-fated Gerard. Meantime prayers and
vows rose from the trembling throng amid-ships, and to hear them,
it seemed there were almost as many gods about as men and women. The
sailors, indeed, relied on a single goddess. They varied her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) titles
only, calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``Queen of Heaven,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Star of the Sea,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mistress
of the World,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Haven of Safety.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But among the landsmen Polytheism
raged. Even those who by some strange chance hit on the same divinity
did not hit on the same edition of that divinity. An English merchant
vowed a heap of gold to our lady of Walsingham. But a Genoese merchant
vowed a silver collar of four pounds to our lady of Loretto; and a
Tuscan noble promised ten pounds of wax lights to our lady of Ravenna;
and with a similar rage for diversity they pledged themselves, not on
the true Cross, but on the true Cross in this, that, or the other modern
city.

<p/>Suddenly a more powerful gust than usual catching the sail at a
disadvantage, the rotten shrouds gave way, and the sail was torn out
with a loud crack, and went down the wind smaller and smaller, blacker
and blacker, and fluttered into the sea, half a mile off, like a sheet
of paper, and ere the helmsman could put the ship's head before the
wind, a wave caught her (<font color='blue'><b>helmsman</b></font>) on the quarter and drenched the poor wretches to
the bone, and gave them a foretaste of chill death. Then one vowed aloud
to turn Carthusian monk, if St. Thomas would save him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). Another would
go a pilgrim to Compostella, bareheaded, barefooted, with nothing but
a coat of mail on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) naked skin, if St. James would save him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). Others
invoked Thomas, Dominic, Denys, and above all, Catherine of Sienna.

<p/>Two petty Neapolitan traders stood shivering.

<p/>One shouted at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``I vow to St. Christopher at Paris
a waxen image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) own weight, if I win safe to land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>On this the other nudged him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``Brother, brother, take heed
what you vow. Why, if you sell all you have in the world by public
auction, `twill not buy his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) weight in wax.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, you fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the vociferator. Then in a whisper:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think ye I am in earnest? Let me but win safe to land, I'll not give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) a rush dip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Others</b></font>)</div><p/>Others lay flat and prayed to the sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, most merciful sea! oh, sea most generous! oh! bountiful sea! oh,
beautiful sea! be gentle, be kind, preserve us in this hour of peril.''

 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><p/>And others wailed and moaned in mere animal terror each time the
ill-fated ship rolled or pitched more terribly than usual; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
now a mere plaything in the arms of the tremendous waves.

<p/>A Roman woman of the humbler class sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) half-bared
breast, silent amid that wailing throng: her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek ashy pale; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye
calm; and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips moved at times in silent prayer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neither
wept, nor lamented, nor bargained with the gods. Whenever the ship
seemed really gone under their feet, and bearded men squeaked, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child; but that was all. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat patient, and suckled
him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) in death's jaws; for why should he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) lose any joy she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could give him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>);
moribundo? Ay, there I do believe, sat Antiquity among those mediaevals.
Sixteen hundred years had not tainted the old Roman blood in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) veins;
and the instinct of a race she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had perhaps scarce heard of taught her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to
die with decent dignity.

<p/>A gigantic friar stood on the poop with feet apart, like the Colossus of
Rhodes, not so much defying, as ignoring, the peril that surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Rhodes</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rhodes</b></font>) recited verses from the Canticles with a loud unwavering voice; and
invited the passengers to confess to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rhodes</b></font>). Some did so on their knees,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rhodes</b></font>) heard them and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Rhodes</b></font>) hands on them, and absolved them as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rhodes</b></font>) had been in a snug sacristy, instead of a perishing ship. Gerard got
nearer and nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), by the instinct that takes the wavering to
the side of the impregnable. And in truth, the courage of heroes facing
fleshly odds might have paled by the side of that gigantic friar, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) still more gigantic composure. Thus, even here, two were found who
maintained the dignity of our race: a woman, tender, yet heroic, and a
monk steeled by religion against mortal fears.

<p/>And now, the sail being gone, the sailors cut down the useless mast a
foot above the board, and it fell with its remaining hamper over the
ship's side. This seemed to relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a little.

<p/>But now the hull, no longer impelled by canvas, could not keep ahead of
the sea. It struck her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again and again on the poop, and the tremendous
blows seemed given by a rocky mountain, not by a liquid.

<p/>The captain left the helm and came amidships pale as death. <div class="bookquote">``Lighten
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Fling all overboard, or we shall founder ere we strike,
and lose the one little chance we have of life.''  (<font color='red'><b>the sailors</b></font>)</div>While the sailors were
executing this order, the captain, pale himself, and surrounded by pale
faces that demanded to know their fate, was talking as unlike an English
skipper in like peril as can well be imagined. <div class="bookquote">``Friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``last
night when all was fair, too fair, alas! there came a globe of fire
close to the ship. When a pair of them come it is good luck, and nought
can drown her (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) that voyage. We mariners call these fiery globes Castor
and Pollux. But if Castor come without Pollux, or Pollux without Castor,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Castor</b></font>) is doomed. Therefore, like good Christians, prepare to die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>These words were received with a loud wail.

<p/>To a trembling inquiry how long they had to prepare, the captain
replied, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Castor</b></font>) may, or may not, last half an hour; over that, impossible;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Castor</b></font>) leaks like a sieve; bustle, men, lighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Castor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor passengers seized on everything that was on deck and flung
it overboard. Presently they laid hold of a heavy sack; an old man was
lying on it, sea sick. They lugged it from under him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It rattled. Two
of them drew it to the side; up started the owner, and with an unearthly
shriek, pounced on it. <div class="bookquote">``Holy Moses! what would you do? `Tis my all;
`tis the whole fruits of my journey; silver candlesticks, silver plates,
brooches, hanaps--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let go, thou hoary villain,''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>cried the others; <div class="bookquote">``shall all our lives be
lost for thy ill-gotten gear?''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fling him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) in with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>cried one; ```tis
this Ebrew we Christian men are drowned for.'' Numbers soon wrenched it
from him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), and heaved it over the side. It splashed into the waves. Then
its owner uttered one cry of anguish, and stood glaring, his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) white hair
streaming in the wind, and was going to leap after it, and would, had
it floated. But it sank, and was gone for ever; and he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) staggered to and
fro, tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) hair, and cursed them and the ship, and the sea, and
all the powers of heaven and hell alike.

<p/>And now the captain cried out: <div class="bookquote">``See, there is a church in sight. Steer
for that church, mate, and you, friends, pray to the saint, whoe’er he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>)
be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div><p/>So they steered for the church and prayed to the unknown god it was
named after. A tremendous sea pooped them, broke the rudder, and jammed
it immovable, and flooded the deck.

<p/>Then wild with superstitious terror some of them came round Gerard.
<div class="bookquote">``Here is the cause of all,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they cried. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) has never invoked a single
saint. He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) is a heathen; here is a pagan aboard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, good friends, say not so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) teeth chattering with
cold and fear. <div class="bookquote">``Rather call these heathens, that lie a praying to
the sea. Friends, I do honour the saints--but I dare not pray to them
now--there is no time---LRB-oh!-RRB- what avail me Dominic, and Thomas, and
Catherine? Nearer God's throne than these St. Peter sitteth; and if I
pray to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), it's odd, but I shall be drowned ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) has time to plead
my cause with God. Oh! oh! oh! I must need go straight to Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that made
the sea, and the saints, and me. Our Father which art in heaven, save
these poor souls and me that cry for the bare life! Oh, sweet Jesus,
pitiful Jesus, that didst walk Genezaret when Peter sank, and wept for
Lazarus dead when the apostles' eyes were dry, oh, save poor Gerard--for
dear Margaret's sake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sailors</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment the sailors were seen preparing to desert the sinking
ship in the little boat, which even at that epoch every ship carried;
then there was a rush of egotists; and thirty souls crowded into it.
Remained behind three who were bewildered, and two who were paralyzed,
with terror. The paralyzed sat like heaps of wet rags, the bewildered
ones ran to and fro, and saw the thirty egotists put off, but made no
attempt to join them: only kept running to and fro, and wringing their
hands. Besides these there was one on his (<font color='blue'><b>egotists</b></font>) knees, praying over the wooden
statue of the Virgin Mary, as large as life, which the sailors had
reverently detached from the mast. It washed about the deck, as the
water came slushing in from the sea, and pouring out at the scuppers;
and this poor soul kept following it on his (<font color='blue'><b>egotists</b></font>) knees, with his (<font color='blue'><b>egotists</b></font>) hands
clasped at it, and the water playing with it. And there was the Jew
palsied, but not by fear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was no longer capable of so petty a
passion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) sat cross-legged, bemoaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) bag, and whenever the
spray lashed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) fist at where it came from, and cursed the
Nazarenes, and their gods, and their devils, and their ships, and their
waters, to all eternity.

<p/>And the gigantic Dominican, having shriven the whole ship, stood calmly
communing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) own spirit. And the Roman woman sat pale and patient,
only drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom as death came nearer.

<p/>Gerard saw this, and it awakened his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) manhood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See! see!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``they have ta’en the boat and left the poor woman
and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child to perish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart soon set his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wit working.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wife, I'll save thee yet, please God.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ran to find a cask or a
plank to float her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). There was none.

<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eye fell on the wooden image of the Virgin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) caught it up in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arms, and heedless of a wail that issued from its worshipper like a
child robbed of its toy, ran aft with it. <div class="bookquote">``Come, wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll lash thee and the child to this. `Tis sore worm eaten, but `twill
serve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) great dark eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and said a single word:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thyself?!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But with wonderful magnanimity and tenderness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a man, and have no child to take care of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) words seemed to animate her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face with a desire
to live. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lashed the image to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side. Then with the hope of life she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
lost something of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heroic calm; not much: her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) body trembled a little,
but not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye.

<p/>The ship was now so low in the water that by using an oar as a lever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
could slide her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into the waves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``while yet there is time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) great Roman eyes, wet now, upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Poor youth!--God
forgive me!--My child!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) launched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on the surge, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
oar kept her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from being battered against the ship.

<p/>A heavy hand fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); a deep sonorous voice sounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ear:
```Tis well. Now come with me.''

<p/>It was the gigantic friar.

<p/>Gerard turned, and the friar took two strides, and laid hold of the
broken mast. Gerard did the same, obeying him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) instinctively. Between
them, after a prodigious effort, they hoisted up the remainder of the
mast, and carried it off. <div class="bookquote">``Fling it in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>said the friar, <div class="bookquote">``and follow
it.''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>They flung it in; but one of the bewildered passengers had run
after them, and jumped first and got on one end. Gerard seized the
other, the friar the middle.

<p/>It was a terrible situation. The mast rose and plunged with each wave
like a kicking horse, and the spray flogged their faces mercilessly, and
blinded them: to help knock them off.

<p/>Presently was heard a long grating noise ahead. The ship had struck, and
soon after, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) being stationary now, they were hurled against her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with
tremendous force. Their companion's head struck against the upper part
of the broken rudder with a horrible crack, and was smashed like a
cocoa-nut by a sledge-hammer. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sunk directly, leaving no trace but
a red stain on the water, and a white clot on the jagged rudder, and a
death cry ringing in their ears, as they drifted clear under the lee of
the black hull. The friar uttered a short Latin prayer for the safety of
his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) soul, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) place composedly. They rolled along; one moment
they saw nothing, and seemed down in a mere basin of watery hills: the
next they caught glimpses of the shore speckled bright with people,
who kept throwing up their arms with wild Italian gestures to encourage
them, and the black boat driving bottom upwards, and between it and
them the woman rising and falling like themselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come across a
paddle, and was holding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child tight with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left arm, and paddling
gallantly with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right.

<p/>When they had tumbled along thus a long time, suddenly the friar said
quietly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I touched the ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard; <div class="bookquote">``we are more than a hundred yards
from shore. Prithee, prithee, leave not our faithful mast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My son,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>said the friar, <div class="bookquote">``you speak prudently. But know that I have
business of Holy Church on hand, and may not waste time floating when
I can walk, in her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) service. There I felt it with my toes again; see the
benefit of wearing sandals, and not shoon. Again; and sandy. Thy
stature is less than mine: keep to the mast! I walk.''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) left the mast
accordingly and extending his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) powerful arms, rushed through the water.
Gerard soon followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). At each overpowering wave the monk stood like
a tower, and closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mouth, threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head back to encounter it, and
was entirely lost under it awhile: then emerged and ploughed lustily on.
At last they came close to the shore; but the suction outward baffled
all their attempts to land. Then the natives sent stout fishermen into
the sea, holding by long spears in a triple chain; and so dragged them
ashore.

<p/>The friar shook himself, bestowed a short paternal benediction on the
natives, and went on to Rome, with eyes bent on earth according to his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
rule, and without pausing. He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) did not even cast a glance back upon that
sea, which had so nearly engulfed him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), but had no power to harm him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>),
without his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) Master's leave.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) stalks on alone to Rome without looking back, I who am not in
the service of Holy Church, stop a moment to say that the reader and
I were within six inches of this giant once before; but we escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
that time. Now I fear we are in for him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>). Gerard grasped every hand upon
the beach. They brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to an enormous fire, and with a delicacy
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would hardly have encountered in the north, left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to dry himself
alone: on this he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bosom a parchment, and a paper, and
dried them carefully. When this was done to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mind, and not till then,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) consented to put on a fisherman's dress and leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own by the
fire, and went down to the beach. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw may be briefly related.

<p/>The captain stuck by the ship, not so much from gallantry, as from a
conviction that it was idle to resist Castor or Pollux, whichever it was
that had come for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in a ball of fire.

<p/>Nevertheless the sea broke up the ship and swept the poop, captain and
all, clear of the rest, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) safe ashore. Gerard had a principal
hand in pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) out of the water. The disconsolate Hebrew landed on
another fragment, and on touching earth, offered a reward for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bag,
which excited little sympathy, but some amusement. Two more were saved
on pieces of the wreck. The thirty egotists came ashore, but one at
a time, and dead; one breathed still. Him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) the natives, with excellent
intentions, took to a hot fire. So then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) too retired from this
shifting scene.

<p/>As Gerard stood by the sea, watching, with horror and curiosity mixed,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) late companions washed ashore, a hand was laid lightly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned. It was the Roman matron, burning with womanly
gratitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) hand gently, and raising it slowly to her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) lips,
kissed it; but so nobly, she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) seemed to be conferring an honour on one
deserving hand. Then with face all beaming and moist eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)
child up and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) preserver.

<p/>Gerard kissed the child more than once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was fond of children. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was much moved; for she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) did not speak at all, except
with her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) eyes, and glowing cheeks, and noble antique gesture, so large
and stately. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was right. Gratitude is not a thing of words.
It was an ancient Roman matron thanking a modern from her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) heart of
hearts.

<p/>Next day towards afternoon, Gerard--twice as old as last year, thrice
as learned in human ways, a boy no more, but a man who had shed blood in
self-defence, and grazed the grave by land and sea--reached the Eternal
City; post tot naufragia tutus.



<p/>CHAPTER LVI

<p/>Gerard took a modest lodging on the west bank of the Tiber, and every
day went forth in search of work, taking a specimen round to every shop
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could hear of that executed such commissions.

<p/>They received him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) coldly. <div class="bookquote">``We make our letter somewhat thinner than
this,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one. <div class="bookquote">``How dark your ink is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another. But the main cry
was, <div class="bookquote">``What avails this? Scant is the Latin writ here now. Can ye not
write Greek?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but not nigh so well as Latin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you shall never make your bread at Rome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard borrowed a beautiful Greek manuscript at a high price, and went
home with a sad hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) purse, but none in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) courage.

<p/>In a fortnight he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had made vast progress with the Greek character;
so then, to lose no time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) used to work at it till noon, and hunt
customers the rest of the day.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) carried round a better Greek specimen than any they possessed,
the traders informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) that Greek and Latin were alike unsaleable; the
city was thronged with works from all Europe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should have come last
year.

<p/>Gerard bought a psaltery. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) landlady, pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looks and
manners, used often to speak a kind word in passing. One day she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dine with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), and somewhat to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) surprise asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) what had
dashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) spirits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) reading of the matter.
<div class="bookquote">``Those sly traders,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) would be bound, <div class="bookquote">``had writers in their pay,
for whose work they received a noble price, and paid a sorry one. So no
wonder they blow cold on you. Methinks you write too well. How know I
that? say you. Marry--marry, because you lock not your door, like the
churl Pietro, and women will be curious. Ay, ay, you write too well for
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard asked an explanation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``your good work might put out the eyes of that they are
selling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Alas! dame, you read folk on the ill side, and you so
kind and frank yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear little heart, these Romans are a subtle race. Me? I am a
Siennese, thanks to the Virgin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mistake was leaving Augsburg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Augsburg?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) haughtily: <div class="bookquote">``is that a place to even to Rome? I
never heard of it, for my part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) then assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should make his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fortune in spite of the
booksellers. <div class="bookquote">``Seeing thee a stranger, they lie to thee without sense or
discretion. Why, all the world knows that our great folk are bitten with
the writing spider this many years, and pour out their money like water,
and turn good land and houses into writ sheepskins, to keep in a chest
or a cupboard. God help them, and send them safe through this fury, as
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hath through a heap of others; and in sooth hath been somewhat less
cutting and stabbing among rival factions, and vindictive eating of
their opposites' livers, minced and fried, since Scribbling came in.
Why, I can tell you two. There is his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eminence Cardinal Bassarion, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) holiness the Pope himself. There be a pair could keep a score such
as thee a writing night and day. But I'll speak to Teresa; she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) hears the
gossip of the court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had seen Teresa, and had heard of five
more signors who were bitten with the writing spider. Gerard took down
their names, and bought parchment, and busied himself for some days in
preparing specimens. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) left one, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) name and address, at each of
these signors' doors, and hopefully awaited the result.

<p/>There was none.

<p/>Day after day passed and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heartsick.

<p/>And strange to say this was just the time when Margaret was fighting so
hard against odds to feed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) male dependents at Rotterdam, and arrested
for curing without a licence instead of killing with one.

<p/>Gerard saw ruin staring him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in the face.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) spent the afternoons picking up canzonets and mastering them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) laid
in playing cards to colour, and struck off a meal per day.

<p/>This last stroke of genius got him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) into fresh trouble.

<p/>In these <div class="bookquote">``camere locande''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>the landlady dressed all the meals, though
the lodgers bought the provisions. So Gerard's hostess speedily detected
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was not ashamed himself: by which brusque
opening, having made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) blush and look scared, she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) pacified herself
all in a moment, and appealed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) good sense whether Adversity was a
thing to be overcome on an empty stomach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Patienza, my lad! times will mend; meantime I will feed you for the
love of heaven.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Italian for <div class="bookquote">``gratis.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, hostess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``my purse is not yet quite void, and it
would add to my trouble an if true folk should lose their due by me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you are as mad as your neighbour Pietro, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) one bad
picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, how know you `tis a bad picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because nobody will buy it. There is one that hath no gift. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) will
have to don casque and glaive, and carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) panel for a shield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard pricked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ears at this: so she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) more. Pietro had
come from Florence with money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) purse, and an unfinished picture;
had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) one unfurnished room, opposite Gerard's, and furnished
it neatly. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) picture was finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) received visitors and had
offers for it: though in her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) opinion liberal ones, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had refused so
disdainfully as to make enemies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) customers. Since then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had
often taken it out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to try and sell, but had always brought it
back; and the last month, she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had seen one movable after another go out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) room, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wore but one suit, and lay at night on a great
chest. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had found this out only by peeping through the keyhole, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) locked the door most vigilantly whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went out. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) afraid
we shall steal his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) chest, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) picture, that no soul in all Rome is
weak enough to buy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sweet hostess; see you not `tis his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) poverty he (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) would screen from
view?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the more fool he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)! Are all our hearts as ill as his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)? A might give us
a trial first, anyway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How you speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). Why, his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) case is mine; and your countryman to
boot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we Siennese love strangers. His (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) case yours? Nay, `tis just the
contrary. You are the comeliest youth ever lodged in this house; hair
like gold: he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is a dark, sour-visaged loon. Besides, you know how to
take a woman on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) better side; but not he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). Natheless, I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) would
not starve to death in my house, to get me a bad name. Anyway, one
starveling is enough in any house. You are far from home, and it is for
me, which am the mistress here, to number your meals--for me and the
Dutch wife, your mother, that is far away: we two women shall settle
that matter. Mind thou thine own business, being a man, and leave
cooking and the like to us, that are in the world for little else that
I see but to roast fowls, and suckle men at starting, and sweep their
grownup cobwebs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear kind dame, in sooth you do often put me in mind of my mother that
is far away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the better; I'll put you more in mind of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) before I have done
with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the honest soul beamed with pleasure.

<p/>Gerard not being an egotist, nor blinded by female partialities, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
own grief in poor proud Pietro; and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought of it the more
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) resolved to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) humble means with that unlucky artist; Pietro's
sympathy would repay him (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) tried to waylay him (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>); but without success.

<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) heard a groaning in the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) knocked at the door, but
received no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) knocked again. A surly voice bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) enter.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) obeyed somewhat timidly, and entered a garret furnished with a chair,
a picture, face to wall, an iron basin, an easel, and a long chest,
on which was coiled a haggard young man with a wonderfully bright eye.
Anything more like a coiled cobra ripe for striking the first comer was
never seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Signor Pietro,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``forgive me that, weary of my own
solitude, I intrude on yours; but I am your nighest neighbour in this
house, and methinks your brother in fortune. I am an artist too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a painter? Welcome, signer. Sit down on my bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div><p/>And Pietro jumped off and waved him (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) into the vacant throne with a
magnificent demonstration of courtesy.

<p/>Gerard bowed, and smiled; but hesitated a little. <div class="bookquote">``I may not call
myself a painter. I am a writer, a caligraph. I copy Greek and Latin
manuscripts, when I can get them to copy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you call that an artist?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without offence to your superior merit, Signor Pietro.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No offence, stranger, none. Only, meseemeth an artist is one who
thinks, and paints his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) thought. Now a caligraph but draws in black and
white the thoughts of another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis well distinguished, signor. But then, a writer can write the
thoughts of the great ancients, and matters of pure reason, such as
no man may paint: ay, and the thoughts of God, which angels could not
paint. But let that pass. I am a painter as well; but a sorry one.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The better thy luck. `They will buy thy work in Rome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But seeking to commend myself to one of thy eminence, I thought it well
rather to call myself a capable writer, than a scurvy painter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment a step was heard on the stair. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! `tis the good dame,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``What oh! hostess, I am here in conversation with Signor
Pietro. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) will let me have my humble dinner here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The Italian bowed gravely.

<p/>The landlady brought in Gerard's dinner smoking and savoury. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put the
dish down on the bed with a face divested of all expression, and went.

<p/>Gerard fell to. But ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had eaten many mouthfuls, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stopped, and
said: <div class="bookquote">``I am an ill-mannered churl, Signor Pietro. I ne’er eat to my mind
when I eat alone. For our Lady's sake put a spoon into this ragout with
me; `tis not unsavoury, I promise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Pietro fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) glittering eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, good youth, thou a stranger, and offerest me thy dinner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, see, there is more than one can eat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I accept,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div>said Pietro; and took the dish with some appearance of
calmness, and flung the contents out of window.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) turned, trembling with mortification and ire, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Let
that teach thee to offer alms to an artist thou knowest not, master
writer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard's face flushed with anger, and it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a bitter struggle not
to box this high-souled creature's ears. And then to go and destroy
good food! His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mother's milk curdled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) veins with horror at such
impiety. Finally, pity at Pietro's petulance and egotism, and a touch of
respect for poverty-struck pride, prevailed.

<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) said coldly, <div class="bookquote">``Likely what thou hast done might pass in a
novel of thy countryman, Signor Boccaccio; but `twas not honest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make that good!''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter sullenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I offered thee half my dinner; no more. But thou hast ta’en it all.
Hadst a right to throw away thy share, but not mine. Pride is well, but
justice is better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div><p/>Pietro stared, then reflected.

<p/>```Tis well. I took thee for a fool, so transparent was thine artifice.
Forgive me! And prithee leave me! Thou seest how `tis with me. The world
hath soured me. I hate mankind. I was not always so. Once more excuse
that my discourtesy, and fare thee well.''

<p/>Gerard sighed, and made for the door.

<p/>But suddenly a thought struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Signor Pietro,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we
Dutchmen are hard bargainers. We are the lads `een eij scheeren,' that
is, `to shave an egg.' Therefore, I, for my lost dinner, do claim to
feast mine eyes on your picture, whose face is toward the wall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter hastily, <div class="bookquote">``ask me not that; I have already
misconducted myself enough towards thee. I would not shed thy blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saints forbid! My blood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stranger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div>said Pietro sullenly, <div class="bookquote">``irritated by repeated insults to my
picture, which is my child, my heart, I did in a moment of rage make a
solemn vow to drive my dagger into the next one that should flout it,
and the labour and love that I have given to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, are all to be slain that will not praise this picture?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>)
looked at its back with curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay; if you would but look at it, and hold your parrot tongues.
But you will be talking. So I have turned it to the wall for ever. Would
I were dead, and buried in it for my coffin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard reflected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I accept the condition. Show me the picture! I can but hold my peace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div><p/>Pietro went and turned its face, and put it in the best light the room
afforded, and coiled himself again on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) chest, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) eye, and
stiletto, glittering.

<p/>The picture represented the Virgin and Christ, flying through the air in
a sort of cloud of shadowy cherubic faces; underneath was a landscape,
forty or fifty miles in extent, and a purple sky above.

<p/>Gerard stood and looked at it in silence. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stepped close, and
looked. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) retired as far off as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could, and looked; but said not
a word.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been at this game half an hour, Pietro cried out querulously
and somewhat inconsistently: <div class="bookquote">``well, have you not a word to say about
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard started. <div class="bookquote">``I cry your mercy; I forgot there were three of us here.
Ay, I have much to say.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sword.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div>cried Pietro, jumping in terror from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) lair. <div class="bookquote">``What
wouldst thou?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry, defend myself against thy bodkin, signor; and at due odds,
being, as aforesaid, a Dutchman. Therefore, hold aloof, while I deliver
judgment, or I will pin thee to the wall like a cockchafer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div>said Pietro, greatly relieved. <div class="bookquote">``I feared you were
going to stab my poor picture with your sword, stabbed already by so
many foul tongues.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard <div class="bookquote">``pursued criticism under difficulties.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>Put himself in a position
of defence, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) sword's point covering Pietro, and one eye glancing
aside at the picture. ``First, signor, I would have you know that, in
the mixing of certain colours, and in the preparation of your oil, you
Italians are far behind us Flemings. But let that flea stick. For as
small as I am, I can show you certain secrets of the Van Eycks, that you
will put to marvellous profit in your next picture. Meantime I see in
this one the great qualities of your nation. Verily, ye are solis filii.
If we have colour, you have imagination. Mother of Heaven! an he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) hath
not flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) immortal soul upon the panel. One thing I go by is this;
it makes other pictures I once admired seem drossy, earth-born things.
The drapery here is somewhat short and stiff, why not let it float
freely, the figures being in air and motion?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will! I will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div>cried Pietro eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``I will do anything for those
who will but see what I have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! This landscape it enlightens me. Henceforth I scorn those little
huddled landscapes that did erst content me. Here is nature's very face:
a spacious plain, each distance marked, and every tree, house, figure,
field, and river smaller and less plain, by exquisite gradation, till
vision itself melts into distance. O, beautiful! And the cunning rogue
hath hung his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) celestial figure in air out of the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) little world
below. Here, floating saints beneath heaven's purple canopy. There,
far down, earth and her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) busy hives. And they let you take this painted
poetry, this blooming hymn, through the streets of Rome and bring it
home unsold. But I tell thee in Ghent or Bruges, or even in Rotterdam,
they would tear it out of thy hands. But it is a common saying that a
stranger's eye sees clearest. Courage, Pietro Vanucci! I reverence thee
and though myself a scurvy painter, do forgive thee for being a great
one. Forgive thee? I thank God for thee and such rare men as thou art;
and bow the knee to thee in just homage. Thy picture is immortal, and
thou, that hast but a chest to sit on, art a king in thy most royal art.
Viva, il maestro! Viva!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div><p/>At this unexpected burst the painter, with all the abandon of his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>)
nation, flung himself on Gerard's neck. <div class="bookquote">``They said it was a maniac's
dream,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) sobbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maniacs themselves! no, idiots!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>shouted Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Generous stranger! I will hate men no more since the world hath such as
thee. I was a viper to fling thy poor dinner away; a wretch, a monster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, monster, wilt be gentle now, and sup with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that I will. Whither goest thou?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To order supper on the instant. We will have the picture for third
man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will invite it whiles thou art gone. My poor picture, child of my
heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, master, `twill look on many a supper after the worms have eaten you
and me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div>said Pietro.



<p/>CHAPTER LVII

<p/>About a week after this the two friends sat working together, but not in
the same spirit. Pietro dashed fitfully at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>), and did wonders in a few
minutes, and then did nothing, except abuse it; then presently resumed
it in a fury, to lay it down with a groan. Through all which kept calmly
working, calmly smiling, the canny Dutchman.

<p/>To be plain, Gerard, who never had a friend he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not master, had put
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) Onagra in harness. The friends were painting playing cards to boil
the pot.

<p/>When done, the indignant master took up his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) picture to make his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) daily
tour in search of a customer.

<p/>Gerard begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to take the cards as well, and try and sell them.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked all the rattle-snake, but eventually embraced Gerard in the
Italian fashion, and took them, after first drying the last-finished
ones in the sun, which was now powerful in that happy clime.

<p/>Gerard, left alone, executed a Greek letter or two, and then mended
a little rent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hose. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) landlady found him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thus employed, and
inquired ironically whether there were no women in the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you have done that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``come and talk to Teresa, my friend
I spoke to thee of, that hath a husband not good for much, which brags
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) acquaintance with the great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard went down, and who should Teresa be but the Roman matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, madama,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is it you? The good dame told me not that. And
the little fair-haired boy, is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) well is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) none the worse for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
voyage in that strange boat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what are you two talking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady mia</b></font>)</div>said the landlady, staring at
them both in turn; <div class="bookquote">``and why tremble you so, Teresa mia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the landlady mia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saved my child's life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>said Teresa, making an effort to compose
herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! my lodger? and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never told me a word of that. Art not ashamed
to look me in the face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! speak not harshly to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron. She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) then turned to
her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) friend and poured out a glowing description of Gerard's conduct,
during which Gerard stood blushing like a girl, and scarce recognizing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own performance, gratitude painted it so fair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to think thou shouldst ask me to serve thy lodger, of whom I knew
nought but that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had thy good word, oh, Fiammina; and that was enough
for me. Dear youth, in serving thee I serve myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/>Then ensued an eager description, by the two women, of what had been
done, and what should be done, to penetrate the thick wall of fees,
commissions, and chicanery, which stood between the patrons of art and
an unknown artist in the Eternal City.

<p/>Teresa smiled sadly at Gerard's simplicity in leaving specimens of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
skill at the doors of the great.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``without promising the servants a share--without even
feeing them, to let the signors see thy merchandise! As well have flung
it into Tiber.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well-a-day!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>sighed Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Then how is an artist to find a patron?
for artists are poor, not rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By going to some city nobler and not so greedy as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>said Teresa.
<div class="bookquote">``La corte Romana non vuol' pecora senza lana.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) fell into thought, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) would come again to-morrow.

<p/>The landlady felicitated Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Teresa has got something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) head,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>).

<p/>Teresa was scarce gone when Pietro returned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) picture, looking
black as thunder. Gerard exchanged a glance with the landlady, and
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) upstairs to console him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, have they let thee bring home thy masterpiece?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As heretofore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More fools they, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not the worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have bought the cards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div>yelled Pietro, and hammered the air
furiously right and left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They flew at me for them. They were enraptured with them. They tried
to conceal their longing for them, but could not. I saw, I feigned, I
pillaged; curse the boobies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) flung down a dozen small silver coins on the floor and jumped
on them, and danced on them with basilisk eyes, and then kicked them
assiduously, and sent them spinning and flying, and running all abroad.
Down went Gerard on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees, and followed the maltreated innocents
directly, and transferred them tenderly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) purse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shouldst rather smile at their ignorance, and put it to profit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div>said Pietro, with concentrated indignation. <div class="bookquote">``The
brutes! We will paint a pack a day; we will set the whole city gambling
and ruining itself, while we live like princes on its vices and
stupidity. There was one of the queens, though, I had fain have kept
back. `Twas you limned her (<font color='blue'><b>queens</b></font>), brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>queens</b></font>) had lovely red-brown hair and
sapphire eyes, and above all, soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pietro,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard softly, <div class="bookquote">``I painted that one from my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>The quick-witted Italian nodded, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes twinkled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You love her (<font color='blue'><b>queens</b></font>) so well, yet leave her (<font color='blue'><b>queens</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pietro, it is because I love her (<font color='blue'><b>queens</b></font>) so dear that I have wandered all this
weary road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div><p/>This interesting colloquy was interrupted by the landlady crying from
below, <div class="bookquote">``Come down, you are wanted.''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went down, and there was Teresa
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with me, Ser Gerard.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LVIII

<p/>Gerard walked silently beside Teresa, wondering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own mind, after
the manner of artists, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) was going to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); instead of
asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>). So at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) own accord. A friend had
informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) of a working goldsmith's wife who wanted a writer. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>queens</b></font>)
shop is hard by; you will not have far to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the goldsmith</b></font>)</div><p/>Accordingly they soon arrived at the goldsmith's wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madama,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>said Teresa, <div class="bookquote">``Leonora tells me you want a writer: I have
brought you a beautiful one; he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) saved my child at sea. Prithee look on
him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) with favour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div><p/>The goldsmith's wife complied in one sense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) eyes on
Gerard's comely face, and could hardly take them off again. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>)
reply was unsatisfactory. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, I have no use for a writer. Ah! I mind
now, it is my gossip, Claelia, the sausage-maker, wants one; she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) told
me, and I told Leonora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div><p/>Teresa made a courteous speech and withdrew.

<p/>Claelia lived at some distance, and when they reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) house she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) was
out. Teresa said calmly, <div class="bookquote">``I will await her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) return,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>and sat so still,
and dignified, and statuesque, that Gerard was beginning furtively to
draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>), when Claelia returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madama, I hear from the goldsmith's wife, the excellent Olympia,
that you need a writer''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-here she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) took Gerard by the hand and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
forward-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``I have brought you a beautiful one; he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) saved my child from
the cruel waves. For our Lady's sake look with favour on him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good dame, my fair Ser,''  (<font color='red'><b>Claelia</b></font>)</div>said Claelia, <div class="bookquote">``I have no use for a writer;
but now you remind me, it was my friend Appia Claudia asked me for one
but the other day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) is a tailor, lives in the Via Lepida.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Claelia</b></font>)</div><p/>Teresa retired calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madama,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``this is likely to be a tedious business for
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Teresa opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was ever done without a little patience?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) added mildly, <div class="bookquote">``We
will knock at every door at Rome but you shall have justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, madama, I think we are dogged. I noticed a man that follows us,
sometimes afar, sometimes close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>said Teresa coldly; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) cheek coloured faintly.
<div class="bookquote">``It is my poor Lodovico.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) stopped and turned, and beckoned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) finger.

<p/>A figure approached them somewhat unwillingly.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) gazed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) full in the face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked sheepish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lodovico mio,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``know this young Ser, of whom I have so often
spoken to thee. Know him (<font color='blue'><b>Ser</b></font>) and love him (<font color='blue'><b>Ser</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Ser</b></font>) it was who saved thy wife
and child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At these last words Lodovico, who had been bowing and grinning
artificially, suddenly changed to an expression of heartfelt gratitude,
and embraced Gerard warmly.

<p/>Yet somehow there was something in the man's original manner, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
having followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wife by stealth, that made Gerard uncomfortable
under this caress. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``We shall have your company, Ser
Lodovico?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, signor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lodovico</b></font>)</div>replied Lodovico, <div class="bookquote">``I go not on that side Tiber.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lodovico</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Addio, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>said Teresa significantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When shall you return home, Teresa mia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I have done mine errand, Lodovico.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They pursued their way in silence. Teresa now wore a sad and almost
gloomy air.

<p/>To be brief, Appia Claudia was merciful, and did not send them over
Tiber again, but only a hundred yards down the street to Lucretia, who
kept the glove shop; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) it was wanted a writer; but what for, Appia
Claudia could not conceive. Lucretia was a merry little dame, who
received them heartily enough, and told them she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) wanted no writer, kept
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) accounts in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It was for my confessor, Father Colonna;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is mad after them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) excellency,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>said Teresa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But, good dame, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is a friar; he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has made vow of poverty. I cannot let
the young man write and not be paid. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saved my child at sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucretia</b></font>)</div>And Lucretia cast an approving look on Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Well, make
your mind easy; a Colonna never wants for money. The good father has
only to say the word, and the princes of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) race will pour a thousand
crowns into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lap. And such a confessor, dame! the best in Rome. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
head is leagues and leagues away all the while; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never heeds what you
are saying. Why, I think no more of confessing my sins to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) than of
telling them to that wall. Once, to try him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I confessed, along with
the rest, as how I had killed my lodger's little girl and baked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in
a pie. Well, when my voice left off confessing, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) started out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
dream, and says he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), a mustering up a gloom, `My erring sister, say three
Paternosters and three Ave Marias kneeling, and eat no butter nor eggs
next Wednesday, and pax vobiscum!' and off a went with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), looking as if there was no such thing as me in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div><p/>Teresa waited patiently, then calmly brought this discursive lady back
to the point: <div class="bookquote">``Would she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) be so kind as go with this good youth to the
friar and speak for him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack! how can I leave my shop? And what need? His (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) door is aye open to
writers, and painters, and scholars, and all such cattle. Why, one day
he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) would not receive the Duke d’Urbino, because a learned Greek was
closeted with him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), and the friar's head and his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) so close together over a
dusty parchment just come in from Greece, as you could put one cowl over
the pair. His (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) wench Onesta told me. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mostly looks in here for a chat
when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) goes an errand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the man for thee, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>said Teresa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All you have to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucretia</b></font>)</div>continued Lucretia, <div class="bookquote">``is to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lodgings -LRB-my
boy shall show them you-RRB-, and tell Onesta you come from me, and you are
a writer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will take you up to him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>). If you put a piece of silver
in the wench's hand, `twill do you no harm: that stands to reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucretia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have silver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>said Teresa warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucretia</b></font>)</div>said Lucretia, ``mind one thing. What the young man saith he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
can do, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be able to do, or let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shun the good friar like
poison. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a very wild beast against all bunglers. Why, `twas but
t'other day, one brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an ill-carved crucifix. Says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `Is this
how you present ``Salvator Mundi?<div class="bookquote">'' who died for you in mortal agony; and
you go and grudge him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) careful work. This slovenly gimcrack, a crucifix?
But that it is a crucifix of some sort, and I am a holy man, I'd dust
your jacket with your crucifix,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Onesta heard every word
through the key-hole; so mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have no fears, madama,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>said Teresa loftily. <div class="bookquote">``I will answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ability; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saved my child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard was not subtle enough to appreciate this conclusion; and was so
far from sharing Teresa's confidence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) begged a respite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would
rather not go to the friar to-day: would not to-morrow do as well?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is a coward for ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucretia</b></font>)</div>said Lucretia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) is not a coward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>said Teresa, firing up; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) is modest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid of this high-born, fastidious friar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard,
<div class="bookquote">``Consider he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) has seen the handiwork of all the writers in Italy, dear
dame Teresa; if you would but let me prepare a better piece of work than
yet I have done, and then to-morrow I will face him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I consent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div>said Teresa.

<p/>They walked home together.

<p/>Not far from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own lodging was a shop that sold vellum. There was a
beautiful white skin in the window. Gerard looked at it wistfully; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could not pay for it; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went on rather hastily. However,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) soon made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mind where to get vellum, and parting with Teresa at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own door, ran hastily upstairs, and took the bond he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had brought all
the way from Sevenbergen, and laid it with a sigh on the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then
prepared with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) chemicals to erase the old writing; but as this was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) last chance of reading it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) now overcame his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) deadly repugnance
to bad writing, and proceeded to decipher the deed in spite of its
detestable contractions. It appeared by this deed that Ghysbrecht Van
Swieten was to advance some money to Floris Brandt on a piece of land,
and was to repay himself out of the rent.

<p/>On this Gerard felt it would be imprudent and improper to destroy the
deed. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) vowed to decipher every word, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) leisure.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went downstairs, determined to buy a small piece of vellum with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
half of the card-money.

<p/>At the bottom of the stairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found the landlady and Teresa talking. At
sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) the former cried, <div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) is. You are caught, donna mia.
See what she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) has bought you?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And whipped out from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) apron the
very skin of vellum Gerard had longed for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, dame! why, donna Teresa!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was speechless with pleasure and
astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear donna Teresa, there is not a skin in all Rome like it. However
came you to hit on this one? `Tis glamour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, dear boy, did not thine eye rest on it with desire? and didst thou
not sigh in turning away from it? And was it for Teresa to let thee want
the thing after that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sagacity! what goodness, madama! Oh, dame, I never thought I
should possess this. What did you pay for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forget. Addio, Fiammina. Addio, Ser Gerard. Be happy, be prosperous,
as you are good.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roman</b></font>)</div>And the Roman matron glided away while Gerard was
hesitating, and thinking how to offer to pay so stately a creature for
her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) purchase.

<p/>The next day in the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went to Lucretia, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) boy took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
to Fra Colonna's lodgings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) business, and feed Onesta,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) up to the friar. Gerard entered with a beating heart.
The room, a large one, was strewed and heaped with objects of art,
antiquity, and learning, lying about in rich profusion, and confusion.
Manuscripts, pictures, carvings in wood and ivory, musical instruments;
and in this glorious chaos sat the friar, poring intently over an
Arabian manuscript.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) looked up a little peevishly at the interruption. Onesta whispered in
his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) be seated. Stay; young man, show me how
you write?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) threw Gerard a piece of paper, and pointed to an
inkhorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So please you, reverend father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``my hand it trembleth too
much at this moment; but last night I wrote a vellum page of Greek, and
the Latin version by its side, to show the various character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Show it me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard brought the work to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in fear and trembling; then stood
heart-sick, awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) verdict.

<p/>When it came it staggered him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). For the verdict was, a Dominican falling
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) neck.

<p/>The next day an event took place in Holland, the effect of which on
Gerard's destiny, no mortal at the time, nor even my intelligent reader
now, could, I think, foresee.

<p/>Marched up to Eli's door a pageant brave to the eye of sense, and to the
vulgar judgment noble, but to the philosophic, pitiable more or less.

<p/>It looked one animal, a centaur; but on severe analysis proved two. The
human half were sadly bedizened with those two metals, to clothe his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>)
carcass with which and line his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) pouch, man has now and then disposed of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) soul: still the horse was the vainer brute of the two; he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) was far
worse beflounced, bebonneted, and bemantled, than any fair lady regnante
crinolina. For the man, under the colour of a warming-pan, retained
Nature's outline. But it was subaudi equum! Scarce a pennyweight of
honest horse-flesh to be seen. Our crinoline spares the noble parts of
women, and makes but the baser parts gigantic -LRB-why this preference?-RRB-;
but this poor animal from stem to stern was swamped in finery. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears
were hid in great sheaths of white linen tipped with silver and blue.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body swaddled in stiff gorgeous cloths descending to the ground,
except just in front, where they left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room to mince. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tail,
though dear to memory, no doubt, was lost to sight, being tucked in
heaven knows how. Only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes shone out like goggles, through two
holes pierced in the wall of haberdashery, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little front hoofs
peeped in and out like rats.

<p/>Yet did this compound, gorgeous and irrational, represent power;
absolute power: it came straight from a tournament at the Duke's court,
which being on a progress, lay last night at a neighbouring town--to
execute the behests of royalty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>cried the upper half, and on Eli emerging, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) wife
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>), saluted them. <div class="bookquote">``Peace be with you, good people. Rejoice! I am
come for your dwarf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli looked amazed, and said nothing. But Catherine screamed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>)
shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``You have mistook your road, good man; here abides no dwarf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) means our Giles, who is somewhat small of stature: why
gainsay what gainsayed may not be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the pageant, ``that is he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>), and discourseth like the big
taber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) breast is sound for that matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And prompt with his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) fists though at long odds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Else how would the poor thing keep his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) head in such a world as this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tis dame</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis well said, dame. Art as ready with thy weapon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>); art his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>)
mother, likely. So bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) forth, and that presently. See, they lead a
stunted mule for him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>). The Duke hath need of him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>), sore need; we are clean
out o' dwarven, and tiger-cats, which may not be, whiles earth them
yieldeth. Our last hop o' my thumb tumbled down the well t'other day.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And think you I'll let my darling go to such an ill-guided house as
you, where the reckless trollops of servants close not the well mouth,
but leave it open to trap innocents, like wolven?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The representative</b></font>)</div><p/>The representative of autocracy lost patience at this unwonted
opposition, and with stern look and voice bade her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bethink her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whether
it was the better of the two; ``to have your abortion at court fed like a
bishop and put on like a prince, or to have all your heads stricken off
and borne on poles, with the bellman crying, `Behold the heads of hardy
rebels, which having by good luck a misbegotten son, did traitorously
grudge him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to the Duke, who is the true father of all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) folk, little
or mickle?'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli sadly, <div class="bookquote">``miscall us not. We be true folk, and neither
rebels nor traitors. But `tis sudden, and the poor lad is our true flesh
and blood, and hath of late given proof of more sense than heretofore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Avails not threatening our lives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>whimpered Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``we grudge him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
not to the Duke; but in sooth he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) cannot go; his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) linen is all in holes.
So there is an end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>But the male mind resisted this crusher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think you the Duke will not find linen, and cloth of gold to boot? None
so brave, none so affected, at court, as our monsters, big or wee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>How long the dispute might have lasted, before the iron arguments of
despotism achieved the inevitable victory, I know not; but it was cut
short by a party whom neither disputant had deigned to consult.

<p/>The bone of contention walked out of the house, and sided with monarchy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If my folk are mad, I am not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) roared. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go with you and on the
instant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>At this Catherine set up a piteous cry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw another of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brood
escaping from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wing into some unknown element. Giles was not
quite insensible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) distress, so simple yet so eloquent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Nay, take not on, mother! Why, `tis a godsend. And I am sick of this,
ever since Gerard left it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, cruel Giles! Should ye not rather say she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is bereaved of Gerard:
the more need of you to stay aside her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I am not going to Rome. Not such a fool. I shall never be farther
than Rotterdam; and I'll often come and see you; and if I like not the
place, who shall keep me there? Not all the dukes in Christendom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good sense lies in little bulk,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the emissary approvingly.
<div class="bookquote">``Therefore, Master Giles, buss the old folk, and thank them for
misbegetting of thee; and ho! you--bring hither his (<font color='blue'><b>ho</b></font>) mule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>dwarf</b></font>)</div><p/>One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) retinue brought up the dwarf mule. Giles refused it with
scorn. And on being asked the reason, said it was not just.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! would ye throw all into one scale! Put muckle to muckle, and
little to wee! Besides, I hate and scorn small things. I'll go on the
highest horse here, or not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The pursuivant eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) attentively a moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) then adopted a
courteous manner. <div class="bookquote">``I shall study your will in all things reasonable.
-LRB-Dismount, Eric, yours is the highest horse.-RRB- And if you would halt in
the town an hour or so, while you bid them farewell, say but the word,
and your pleasure shall be my delight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>Giles reflected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if we wait a month, `twill be still the same: my
mother is a good soul, but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) body is bigger than her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spirit. We shall
not part without a tear or two, and the quicker `tis done the fewer; so
bring yon horse to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face and sobbed. The high horse was
brought, and Giles was for swarming up his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) tail, like a rope; but one
of the servants cried out hastily, <div class="bookquote">``Forbear, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) kicketh.''  (<font color='red'><b>the servants</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll kick
him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles. <div class="bookquote">``Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) close beneath this window, and I'll learn
you all how to mount a horse which kicketh, and will not be clomb by
the tail, the staircase of a horse.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) dashed into the house, and
almost immediately reappeared at an upper window, with a rope in his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) fastened an end somehow, and holding the other, descended
as swift and smooth as an oiled thunderbolt in a groove, and lighted
astride his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) high horse as unperceived by that animal as a fly settling
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).

<p/>The official lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) hands to heaven in mawkish admiration. <div class="bookquote">``I have
gotten a pearl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and wow but this will be a good day's work
for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, father, come, mother, buss me, and bless me, and off I go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) blessing, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) be honest and true, and a credit
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) folk. Catherine could not speak, but clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) with many sobs
and embraces; and even through the mist of tears her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eye detected in a
moment the little rent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) sleeve he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) had made getting out of window,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whipped out her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) needle and mended it then and there, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
tears fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) arm the while, unheeded--except by those unfleshly
eyes, with which they say the very air is thronged.

<p/>And so the dwarf mounted the high horse, and rode away complacent with
the old hand laying the court butter on his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) back with a trowel.

<p/>Little recked Perpusillus of two poor silly females that sat by the
bereaved hearth, rocking themselves, and weeping, and discussing all his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>)
virtues, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) mind had opened lately, and blind as two beetles to
his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) faults, who rode away from them, jocund and bold.

<p/>Ingentes animos angusto pectore versans.

<p/>Arrived at court he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) speedily became a great favourite.

<p/>One strange propensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) electrified the palace; but on account
of his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) small size, and for variety's sake, and as a monster, he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) was
indulged on it. In a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) was let speak the truth.

<p/>It is an unpopular thing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) made it an intolerable one.

<p/>Bawled it.



<p/>CHAPTER LIX

<p/>Happy the man who has two chain-cables: Merit, and Women.

<p/>Oh, that I, like Gerard, had a `chaine des dames' to pull up by.

<p/>I would be prose laureat, or professor of the spasmodic, or something,
in no time. En attendant, I will sketch the Fra Colonna.

<p/>The true revivers of ancient learning and philosophy were two writers of
fiction--Petrarch and Boccaccio.

<p/>Their labours were not crowned with great, public, and immediate
success; but they sowed the good seed; and it never perished, but
quickened in the soil, awaiting sunshine.

<p/>From their day Italy was never without a native scholar or two,
versed in Greek; and each learned Greek who landed there was received
fraternally. The fourteenth century, ere its close, saw the birth
of Poggio, Valla, and the elder Guarino; and early in the fifteenth
Florence under Cosmo de Medici was a nest of Platonists. These, headed
by Gemistus Pletho, a born Greek, began about A.D. 1440 to write down
Aristotle. For few minds are big enough to be just to great A without
being unjust to capital B.

<p/>Theodore Gaza defended that great man with moderation; George of
Trebizond with acerbity, and retorted on Plato. Then Cardinal Bessarion,
another born Greek, resisted the said George, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) idol, in a tract
<div class="bookquote">``Adversus calumniatorem Platonis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George</b></font>)</div><p/>Pugnacity, whether wise or not, is a form of vitality. Born without
controversial bile in so zealous an epoch, Francesco Colonna, a young
nobleman of Florence, lived for the arts. At twenty he (<font color='blue'><b>Francesco</b></font>) turned Dominican
friar. His (<font color='blue'><b>Francesco</b></font>) object was quiet study. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francesco</b></font>) retired from idle company, and
faction fights, the humming and the stinging of the human hive, to St.
Dominic and the Nine Muses.

<p/>An eager student of languages, pictures, statues, chronology, coins,
and monumental inscriptions. These last loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) faith in popular
histories.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) travelled many years in the East, and returned laden with spoils;
master of several choice MSS., and versed in Greek and Latin, Hebrew and
Syriac. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) country had not stood still. Other lettered princes
besides Cosmo had sprung up. Alfonso King of Naples, Nicolas d’Este,
Lionel d’Este, etc.. Above all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) old friend Thomas of Sarzana had been
made Pope, and had lent a mighty impulse to letters; had accumulated
5000 MSS. in the library of the Vatican, and had set Poggio to translate
Diodorus Siculus and Xenophon's Cyropaedia, Laurentius Valla to
translate Herodotus and Thucydides, Theodore Gaza, Theophrastus; George
of Trebizond, Eusebius, and certain treatises of Plato, etc. etc..

<p/>The monk found Plato and Aristotle under armistice, but Poggio and
Valla at loggerheads over verbs and nouns, and on fire with odium
philologicum. All this was heaven; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Plato</b></font>) settled down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Plato</b></font>) native
land, his (<font color='blue'><b>Plato</b></font>) life a rosy dream. None so happy as the versatile,
provided they have not their bread to make by it. And Fra Colonna was
Versatility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) knew seven or eight languages, and a little mathematics;
could write a bit, paint a bit, model a bit, sing a bit, strum a bit;
and could relish superior excellence in all these branches. For
this last trait he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) deserved to be as happy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) was. For, gauge the
intellects of your acquaintances, and you will find but few whose minds
are neither deaf, nor blind, nor dead to some great art or science--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>acquaintances</b></font>)</div><p/>And such of them as are conceited as well as stupid shall even parade
instead of blushing for the holes in their intellects.

<p/>A zealot in art, the friar was a sceptic in religion.

<p/>In every age there are a few men who hold the opinions of another age,
past or future. Being a lump of simplicity, his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) sceptism was as naif as
his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) enthusiasm. He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) affected to look on the religious ceremonies of his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
day as his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) models, the heathen philosophers, regarded the worship of
gods and departed heroes: mummeries good for the populace. But here his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
mind drew unconsciously a droll distinction. Whatever Christian ceremony
his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) learning taught him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) was of purely pagan origin, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) respected,
out of respect for antiquity; though had he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) turn of mind,
been a pagan and its contemporary, he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) would have scorned it from his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
philosophic heights.

<p/>Fra Colonna was charmed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) new artist, and having the run of half
the palaces in Rome, sounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) praises so, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) was soon called
upon to resign him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) told Gerard what great princes wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But I
am so happy with you, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>objected Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Fiddlestick about being
happy with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div>said Fra Colonna; <div class="bookquote">``you must not be happy; you must be a
man of the world; the grand lesson I impress on the young is, be a man
of the world. Now these Montesini can pay you three times as much as I
can, and they shall too-by Jupiter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div><p/>And the friar clapped a terrific price on Gerard's pen. It was acceded
to without a murmur. Much higher prices were going for copying than
authorship ever obtained for centuries under the printing press.

<p/>Gerard had three hundred crowns for Aristotle's treatise on rhetoric.

<p/>The great are mighty sweet upon all their pets, while the fancy lasts;
and in the rage for Greek MSS. the handsome writer soon became a pet,
and nobles of both sexes caressed him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) like a lap dog.

<p/>It would have turned a vain fellow's head; but the canny Dutchman
saw the steel hand beneath the velvet glove, and did not presume.
Nevertheless it was a proud day for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dutchman</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dutchman</b></font>) found himself seated
with Fra Colonna at the table of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) present employer, Cardinal
Bessarion. They were about a mile from the top of that table; but never
mind, there they were and Gerard had the advantage of seeing roast
pheasants dished up with all their feathers as if they had just flown
out of a coppice instead of off the spit: also chickens cooked in
bottles, and tender as peaches. But the grand novelty was the napkins,
surpassingly fine, and folded into cocked hats, and birds' wings, and
fans, etc., instead of lying flat. This electrified Gerard; though my
readers have seen the dazzling phenomenon without tumbling backwards
chair and all.

<p/>After dinner the tables were split in pieces, and carried away, and lo,
under each was another table spread with sweetmeats. The signoras and
signorinas fell upon them and gormandized; but the signors eyed them
with reasonable suspicion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, dear father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>objected Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``I see not the bifurcal daggers,
with which men say his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) excellency armeth the left hand of a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, `tis the Cardinal Orsini which hath invented yon peevish
instrument for his (<font color='blue'><b>Orsini</b></font>) guests to fumble their meat withal. One, being in
haste, did skewer his (<font color='blue'><b>Orsini</b></font>) tongue to his (<font color='blue'><b>Orsini</b></font>) palate with it, I hear; O tempora,
O mores! The ancients, reclining godlike at their feasts, how had they
spurned such pedantries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as the ladies had disported themselves among the sugar-plums,
the tables were suddenly removed, and the guests sat in a row against
the wall. Then came in, ducking and scraping, two ecclesiastics with
lutes, and kneeled at the cardinal's feet and there sang the service
of the day; then retired with a deep obeisance: In answer to which
the cardinal fingered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) skull cap as our late Iron Duke his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hat: the
company dispersed, and Gerard had dined with a cardinal and one that had
thrice just missed being pope.

<p/>But greater honour was in store.

<p/>One day the cardinal sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and after praising the beauty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
work took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) coach to the Vatican; and up a private stair to a
luxurious little room, with a great oriel window. Here were inkstands,
sloping frames for writing on, and all the instruments of art. The
cardinal whispered a courtier, and presently the Pope's private
secretary appeared with a glorious grimy old MS. of Plutarch's Lives.
And soon Gerard was seated alone copying it, awe-struck, yet half
delighted at the thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) holiness would handle his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) work and
read it.

<p/>The papal inkstands were all glorious externally; but within the ink
was vile. But Gerard carried ever good ink, home-made, in a dirty little
inkhorn: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) prayed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees for a firm and skilful hand, and set to
work.

<p/>One side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) room was nearly occupied by a massive curtain divided
in the centre; but its ample folds overlapped. After a while Gerard
felt drawn to peep through that curtain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) resisted the impulse. It
returned. It overpowered him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) left Plutarch; stole across the matted
floor; took the folds of the curtain, and gently gathered them up with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fingers, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nose through the chink ran it against a
cold steel halbert. Two soldiers, armed cap-a-pie, were holding their
glittering weapons crossed in a triangle. Gerard drew swiftly back; but
in that instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard the soft murmur of voices, and saw a group of
persons cringing before some hidden figure.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) never repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) attempt to pry through the guarded curtain; but
often eyed it. Every hour or so an ecclesiastic peeped in, eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>),
chilled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and exit. All this was gloomy, and mechanical. But the next
day a gentleman, richly armed, bounced in, and glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What is
toward here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/>Gerard told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was writing out Plutarch, with the help of the
saints. The spark said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did not know the signor in question. Gerard
explained the circumstances of time and space that had deprived the
Signor Plutarch of the advantage of the spark's conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! one of those old dead Greeks they keep such a coil about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, signor, one of them, who, being dead, yet live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand you not, young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the noble, with all the dignity
of ignorance. <div class="bookquote">``What did the old fellow write? Love stories?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
eyes sparkled: <div class="bookquote">``merry tales, like Boccaccio.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, lives of heroes and sages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Soldiers and popes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Soldiers and princes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wilt read me of them some day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And willingly, signor. But what would they say who employ me, were I to
break off work?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, never heed that; know you not who I am? I am Jacques Bonaventura,
nephew to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaventura</b></font>) holiness the Pope, and captain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaventura</b></font>) guards. And I came
here to look after my fellows. I trow they have turned them out of
their room for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Signor Bonaventura then hurried away. This lively
companion, however, having acquired a habit of running into that little
room, and finding Gerard good company, often looked in on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and
chattered ephemeralities while Gerard wrote the immortal lives.

<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came a changed and moody man, and threw himself into chair,
crying, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, traitress! traitress!''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>Gerard inquired what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ill?
<div class="bookquote">``Traitress! traitress!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply. Whereupon Gerard wrote Plutarch.
Then says Bonaventura, <div class="bookquote">``I am melancholy; and for our Lady's sake read
me a story out of Ser Plutarcho, to soothe my bile: in all that Greek is
there nought about lovers betrayed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacques Bonaventura/Jacques/Bonaventura</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard read him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) the life of Alexander. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) got excited, marched about the
room, and embracing the reader, vowed to shun <div class="bookquote">``soft delights,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>that bed
of nettles, and follow glory.

<p/>Who so happy now as Gerard? His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) art was honoured, and fabulous prices
paid for it; in a year or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should return by sea to Holland, with
good store of money, and set up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) beloved Margaret in Bruges, or
Antwerp, or dear Augsburg, and end their days in peace, and love, and
healthy, happy labour. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart never strayed an instant from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) prosperity he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did not forget poor Pietro. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took the Fra Colonna
to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) picture. The friar inspected it severely and closely, fell on
the artist's neck, and carried the picture to one of the Colonnas, who
gave a noble price for it.

<p/>Pietro descended to the first floor; and lived like a gentleman.

<p/>But Gerard remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) garret. To increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) expenses would have
been to postpone his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) return to Margaret. Luxury had no charms for the
single-hearted one, when opposed to love.

<p/>Jacques Bonaventura made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaventura</b></font>) acquainted with other gay young fellows.
They loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaventura</b></font>), and sought to entice him (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaventura</b></font>) into vice, and other expenses.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaventura</b></font>) begged humbly to be excused. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaventura</b></font>) escaped that temptation. But a
greater was behind.



<p/>CHAPTER LX

<p/>FRA COLONNA had the run of the Pope's library, and sometimes left
off work at the same hour and walked the city with Gerard, on which
occasions the happy artist saw all things en beau, and was wrapped up in
the grandeur of Rome and its churches, palaces, and ruins.

<p/>The friar granted the ruins, but threw cold water on the rest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This place Rome? It is but the tomb of mighty Rome.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) showed Gerard
that twenty or thirty feet of the old triumphal arches were underground,
and that the modern streets ran over ancient palaces, and over the tops
of columns; and coupling this with the comparatively narrow limits of
the modern city, and the gigantic vestiges of antiquity that peeped
aboveground here and there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) uttered a somewhat remarkable simile. <div class="bookquote">``I
tell thee this village they call Rome is but as one of those swallows'
nests ye shall see built on the eaves of a decayed abbey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old Rome must indeed have been fair then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard.

<p/>``Judge for yourself, my son; you see the great sewer, the work of the
Romans in their very childhood, and shall outlast Vesuvius. You see the
fragments of the Temple of Peace. How would you look could you see also
the Capitol with its five-and-twenty temples? Do but note this Monte
Savello; what is it, an it pleases you, but the ruins of the ancient
theatre of Marcellus? and as for Testacio, one of the highest hills in
modern Rome, it is but an ancient dust heap; the women of old Rome flung
their broken pots and pans there, and lo--a mountain.

<p/>```Ex pede Herculem; ex ungue leonem.'''

<p/>Gerard listened respectfully, but when the holy friar proceeded by
analogy to imply that the moral superiority of the heathen Romans was
proportionally grand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) resisted stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``Has then the world lost
by Christ His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); but blushed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) felt himself
reproaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) benefactor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Saints forbid!''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>said the friar. ```Twere heresy to say so.'' And having
made this direct concession, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) proceeded gradually to evade it by
subtle circumlocution, and reached the forbidden door by the spiral back
staircase. In the midst of all which they came to a church with a knot
of persons in the porch. A demon was being exorcised within. Now Fra
Colonna had a way of uttering a curious sort of little moan, when things
Zeno or Epicurus would not have swallowed were presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeno</b></font>) as
facts. This moan conveyed to such as had often heard it not only strong
dissent, but pity for human credulity, ignorance, and error, especially
of course when it blinded men to the merits of Pagandom.

<p/>The friar moaned, and said, ``Then come away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, father, prithee! prithee! I ne’er saw a divell cast out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The friar</b></font>)</div><p/>The friar accompanied Gerard into the church, but had a good shrug
first. There they found the demoniac forced down on his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) knees before the
altar with a scarf tied round his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) neck, by which the officiating priest
held him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) like a dog in a chain.

<p/>Not many persons were present, for fame had put forth that the last
demon cast out in that church went no farther than into one of the
company: <div class="bookquote">``as a cony ferreted out of one burrow runs to the next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the demon</b></font>)</div><p/>When Gerard and the friar came up, the priest seemed to think there were
now spectators enough; and began.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) faced the demoniac, breviary in hand, and first set himself to learn
the individual's name with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) had to deal.

<p/>``Come out, Ashtaroth. Oho! it is not you then. Come out, Belial. Come
out, Tatzi. Come out, Eza. No; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trembles not. Come out, Azymoth. Come
out, Feriander. Come out, Foletho. Come out, Astyma. Come out, Nebul.
Aha! what, have I found ye? `tis thou, thou reptile; at thine old
tricks. Let us pray!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lord, we pray thee to drive the foul fiend Nebul out of this thy
creature: out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) eyes, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) nose, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
mouth, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) ears, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) gums, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) teeth, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
shoulders, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) arms, legs, loins, stomach, bowels, thighs, knees,
calves, feet, ankles, finger-nails, toe-nails, and soul. Amen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The priest</b></font>)</div><p/>The priest then rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) knees, and turning to the company, said,
with quiet geniality, <div class="bookquote">``Gentles, we have here as obstinate a divell as
you may see in a summer day.''  (<font color='red'><b>The priest</b></font>)</div>Then, facing the patient, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) spoke to
him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) with great rigour, sometimes addressing `the man and sometimes the
fiend, and they answered him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) in turn through the same mouth, now saying
that they hated those holy names the priest kept uttering, and now
complaining they did feel so bad in their inside.

<p/>It was the priest who first confounded the victim and the culprit in
idea, by pitching into the former, cuffing him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) soundly, kicking him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>), and
spitting repeatedly in his (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) face. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) took a candle and lighted it,
and turned it down, and burned it till it burned his (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) fingers; when he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>)
dropped it double quick. Then took the custodial; and showed the patient
the Corpus Domini within. Then burned another candle as before, but more
cautiously: then spoke civilly to the demoniac in his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) human character,
dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>), and received the compliments of the company.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``how you have their names by heart. Our
northern priests have no such exquisite knowledge of the hellish
squadrons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, young man, here we know all their names, and eke their ways, the
reptiles. This Nebul is a bitter hard one to hunt out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then told the company in the most affable way several of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
experiences; concluding with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feat of yesterday, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) drove a
great hulking fiend out of a woman by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth, leaving behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
certain nails, and pins, and a tuft of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own hair, and cried out in a
voice of anguish, ```Tis not thou that conquers me. See that stone on
the window sill. Know that the angel Gabriel coming down to earth once
lighted on that stone: `tis that has done my business.''

<p/>The friar moaned. <div class="bookquote">``And you believed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certes! who but an infidel has discredited a revelation so precise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, believe the father of lies? That is pushing credulity beyond the
age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a liar does not always lie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay doth he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) tells an improbable story to begin, and shows
you a holy relic; arms you against the Satanic host. Fiends -LRB-if any-RRB- be
not so simple. Shouldst have answered him (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) out of antiquity--

<p/>`Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.'

<p/>Some blackguard chopped his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) wife's head off on that stone, young man;
you take my word for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the friar hurried Gerard away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack, father, I fear you abashed the good priest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, by Pollux,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>said the friar, with a chuckle; <div class="bookquote">``I blistered him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) with
a single touch of `Socratic interrogation.' What modern can parry the
weapons of antiquity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div><p/>One afternoon, when Gerard had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) day's work, a fine lackey
came and demanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) attendance at the Palace Cesarini. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went, and
was ushered into a noble apartment; there was a girl seated in it,
working on a tapestry. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose and left the room, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would
let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mistress know.

<p/>A good hour did Gerard cool his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heels in that great room, and at last
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) began to fret. <div class="bookquote">``These nobles think nothing of a poor fellow's time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>However, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mind to slip out, and go about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) business, the door opened, and a superb beauty entered the room,
followed by two maids. It was the young princess of the house of
Cesarini. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) came in talking rather loudly and haughtily to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
dependents, but at sight of Gerard lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) voice to a very feminine
tone, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Are you the writer, messer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am, Signora.

<p/>```Tis well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) then seated herself; Gerard and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) maids remained standing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your name, good youth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard, signora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard? body of Bacchus! is that the name of a human creature?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a Dutch name, signora. I was born at Tergou, in Holland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A harsh name, girls, for so well-favoured a youth; what say you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The maids</b></font>)</div><p/>The maids assented warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) for?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>inquired the lady, with lofty languor.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, I remember. Be seated, Ser Gerardo, and write me a letter to Ercole
Orsini, my lover; at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Orsini</b></font>) says so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard seated himself, took out paper and ink, and looked up to the
princess for instructions.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), seated on a much higher chair, almost a throne, looked down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
with eyes equally inquiring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Gerardo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ready, your excellence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Write, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I but await the words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who, think you, is to provide them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who but your grace, whose letter it is to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gramercy! what, you writers, find you not the words? What avails your
art without the words? I doubt you are an impostor, Gerardo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Signora, I am none. I might make shift to put your highness's
speech into grammar, as well as writing. But I cannot interpret your
silence. Therefore speak what is in your heart, and I will empaper it
before your eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is nothing in my heart. And sometimes I think I have got no
heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is in your mind, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is nothing in my mind; nor my head neither.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why write at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, indeed? That is the first word of sense either you or I have
spoken, Gerardo. Pestilence seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerardo</b></font>)! why writeth he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerardo</b></font>) not first? then I
could say nay to this, and ay to that, withouten headache. Also is it a
lady's part to say the first word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, signora: the last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well spoken, Gerardo. Ha! ha! Shalt have a gold piece for thy
wit. Give me my purse!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) for the article on the nail a
la moyen age. Money never yet chilled zeal. Gerard, after getting a gold
piece so cheap, felt bound to pull her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) difficulty, if the wit
of man might achieve it. <div class="bookquote">``Signorina,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``these things are only
hard because folk attempt too much, are artificial and labour phrases.
Do but figure to yourself the signor you love--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerardo</b></font>) not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, the signor you love not-seated at this table, and dict to
me just what you would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerardo</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerardo</b></font>) sat there, I should say, `Go away.'''

<p/>Gerard, who was flourishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pen by way of preparation, laid it down
with a groan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Floretta</b></font>)</div>said Floretta, ``your highness would say, `Come
back.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like enough, wench. Now silence, all, and let me think. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pestered me
to write, and I promised; so mine honour is engaged. What lie shall I
tell the Gerardo to tell the fool?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) head away from
them and fell into deep thought, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) noble chin resting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>)
white hand, half clenched.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) was so lovely and statuesque, and looked so inspired with thoughts
celestial, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) sat thus, impregnating herself with mendacity, that
Gerard forgot all, except art, and proceeded eagerly to transfer that
exquisite profile to paper.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had very nearly finished when the fair statue turned brusquely round
and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Signora,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), a little peevishly; <div class="bookquote">``for Heaven's sake change
not your posture--`twas perfect. See, you are nearly finished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>All eyes were instantly on the work, and all tongues active.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How like! and done in a minute: nay, methinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) highness's chin is
not quite so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a touch will make that right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity `tis not coloured. I'm all for colours. Hang black and
white! And her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) highness hath such a lovely skin. Take away her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) skin, and
half her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) beauty is lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Peace. Can you colour, Ser Gerardo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, signorina. I am a poor hand at oils; there shines my friend Pietro;
but in this small way I can tint you to the life, if you have time to
waste on such vanity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Call you this vanity? And for time, it hangs on me like lead. Send for
your colours now--quick, this moment--for love of all the saints.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, signorina, I must prepare them. I could come at the same time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it. And you, Floretta, see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) be admitted at all hours.
Alack! Leave my head! leave my head!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, Signora; I thought to prepare it at home to receive the
colours. But I will leave it. And now let us despatch the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Signor Orsini.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall I waste my time on such vanity as writing letters--and to
that empty creature, to whom I am as indifferent as the moon? Nay, not
indifferent, for I have just discovered my real sentiments. I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Orsini</b></font>)
and despise him (<font color='blue'><b>Orsini</b></font>). Girls, I here forbid you once for all to mention that
signor's name to me again; else I'll whip you till the blood comes. You
know how I can lay on when I'm roused.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We do. We do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then provoke me not to it;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) eye flashed daggers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) turned
to Gerard all instantaneous honey. <div class="bookquote">``Addio, il Gerardo.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>And Gerard bowed
himself out of this velvet tiger's den.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came next day and coloured her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>); and next he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was set to make a
portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) on a large scale; and then a full-length figure; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was obliged to set apart two hours in the afternoon, for drawing and
painting this princess, whose beauty and vanity were prodigious, and
candidates for a portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) numerous. Here the thriving Gerard
found a new and fruitful source of income.

<p/>Margaret seemed nearer and nearer.


<p/>It was Holy Thursday. No work this day. Fra Colonna and Gerard sat in a
window and saw the religious processions. Their number and pious ardour
thrilled Gerard with the devotion that now seemed to animate the whole
people, lately bent on earthly joys.

<p/>Presently the Pope came pacing majestically at the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)
cardinals, in a red hat, white cloak, a capuchin of red velvet, and
riding a lovely white Neapolitan barb, caparisoned with red velvet
fringed and tasselled with gold; a hundred horsemen, armed cap-a-pie,
rode behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) with their lances erected, the butt-end resting on the
man's thigh. The cardinals went uncovered, all but one, de Medicis, who
rode close to the Pope and conversed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) as with an equal. At every
fifteen steps the Pope stopped a single moment, and gave the people his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)
blessing, then on again.

<p/>Gerard and the friar now came down, and threading some by-streets
reached the portico of one of the seven churches. It was hung with
black, and soon the Pope and cardinals, who had entered the church
by another door, issued forth, and stood with torches on the steps,
separated by barriers from the people; then a canon read a Latin Bull,
excommunicating several persons by name, especially such princes as were
keeping the Church out of any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) temporal possessions.

<p/>At this awful ceremony Gerard trembled, and so did the people. But two
of the cardinals spoiled the effect by laughing unreservedly the whole
time.

<p/>When this was ended, the black cloth was removed, and revealed a gay
panoply; and the Pope blessed the people, and ended by throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)
torch among them: so did two cardinals. Instantly there was a scramble
for the torches: they were fought for, and torn in pieces by the
candidates, so devoutly that small fragments were gained at the price
of black eyes, bloody noses, and burnt fingers; In which hurtling his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)
holiness and suite withdrew in peace.

<p/>And now there was a cry, and the crowd rushed to a square where was a
large, open stage: several priests were upon it praying. They rose, and
with great ceremony donned red gloves. Then one of their number kneeled,
and with signs of the lowest reverence drew forth from a shrine a square
frame, like that of a mirror, and inside was as it were the impression
of a face.

<p/>It was the Verum icon, or true impression of our Saviour's face, taken
at the very moment of His (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) most mortal agony for us. Received as it was
without a grain of doubt, imagine how it moved every Christian heart.

<p/>The people threw themselves on their faces when the priest raised it on
high; and cries of pity were in every mouth, and tears in almost every
eye. After a while the people rose, and then the priest went round the
platform, showing it for a single moment to the nearest; and at each
sight loud cries of pity and devotion burst forth.

<p/>Soon after this the friends fell in with a procession of Flagellants,
flogging their bare shoulders till the blood ran streaming down; but
without a sign of pain in their faces, and many of them laughing and
jesting as they lashed. The bystanders out of pity offered them wine;
they took it, but few drank it; they generally used it to free the tails
of the cat, which were hard with clotted blood, and make the next stroke
more effective. Most of them were boys, and a young woman took pity on
one fair urchin. <div class="bookquote">``Alas! dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``why wound thy white skin
so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Basta,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), laughing, ```tis for your sins I do it, not for
mine.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear you that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>said the friar. <div class="bookquote">``Show me the whip that can whip
the vanity out of man's heart! The young monkey; how knoweth he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) that
stranger is a sinner more than he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``surely this is not to our Lord's mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was so
pitiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our Lord?''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>said the friar, crossing himself. <div class="bookquote">``What has He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to do with
this? This was a custom in Rome six hundred years before He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was born.
The boys used to go through the streets, at the Lupercalia flogging
themselves. And the married women used to shove in, and try and get a
blow from the monkeys' scourges; for these blows conferred fruitfulness
in those days. A foolish trick this flagellation; but interesting to
the bystander; reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>bystander</b></font>) of the grand old heathen. We are so prone to
forget all we owe them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Pope</b></font>)</div><p/>Next they got into one of the seven churches, and saw the Pope give the
mass. The ceremony was imposing, but again--spoiled by the inconsistent
conduct of the cardinals and other prelates, who sat about the altar
with their hats on, chattering all through the mass like a flock of
geese.

<p/>The eucharist in both kinds was tasted by an official before the Pope
would venture on it; and this surprised Gerard beyond measure. <div class="bookquote">``Who is
that base man? and what doth he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that is `the Preguste,' and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tastes the eucharist by way of
precaution. This is the country for poison; and none fall oftener by it
than the poor Popes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! so I have heard; but after the miraculous change of the bread
and wine to Christ His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) body and blood, poison cannot remain; gone is the
bread with all its properties and accidents; gone is the wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So says Faith; but experience tells another tale. Scores have died in
Italy poisoned in the host.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I tell you, father, that were both bread and wine charged with
direst poison before his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) holiness had consecrated them, yet after
consecration I would take them both withouten fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So would I, but for the fine arts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What mean you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry, that I would be as ready to leave the world as thou, were it not
for those arts, which beautify existence here below, and make it dear to
men of sense and education. No; so long as the Nine Muses strew my path
with roses of learning and art, me may Apollo inspire with wisdom and
caution, that knowing the wiles of my countrymen, I may eat poison
neither at God's altar nor at a friend's table, since, wherever I eat
it or drink it, it will assuredly cut short my mortal thread; and I am
writing a book--heart and soul in it--`The Dream of Polifilo,' the
man of many arts. So name not poison to me till that is finished and
copied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div><p/>And now the great bells of St. John Lateran's were rung with a clash at
short intervals, and the people hurried thither to see the heads of St.
Peter and St. Paul.

<p/>Gerard and the friar got a good place in the church, and there was a
great curtain, and after long and breathless expectation of the people,
this curtain was drawn by jerks, and at a height of about thirty feet
were two human heads with bearded faces, that seemed alive. They were
shown no longer than the time to say an Ave Maria, and then the curtain
drawn. But they were shown in this fashion three times. St. Peter's
complexion was pale, his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) face oval, his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) beard grey and forked; his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) head
crowned with a papal mitre. St. Paul was dark skinned, with a thick,
square beard; his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face also and head were more square and massive, and
full of resolution.

<p/>Gerard was awe-struck. The friar approved after his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fashion.

<p/>``This exhibition of the `imagines,' or waxen effigies of heroes and
demigods, is a venerable custom, and inciteth the vulgar to virtue by
great and invisible examples.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Waxen images? What, are they not the apostles themselves, embalmed, or
the like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The friar</b></font>)</div><p/>The friar moaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They did not exist in the year 800. The great old Roman families always
produced at their funerals a series of these `imagines,' thereby tying
past and present history together, and showing the populace the
features of far-famed worthies. I can conceive nothing more thrilling or
instructive. But then the effigies were portraits made during life or
at the hour of death. These of St. Paul and St. Peter are moulded out of
pure fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! say not so, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the worst is, this humour of showing them up on a shelf, and half
in the dark, and by snatches, and with the poor mountebank trick of a
drawn curtain.

<p/>`Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi.'

<p/>Enough; the men of this day are not the men of old. Let us have done
with these new-fangled mummeries, and go among the Pope's books; there
we shall find the wisdom we shall vainly hunt in the streets of modern
Rome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div><p/>And this idea having once taken root, the good friar plunged and tore
through the crowd, and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left,
till he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) had escaped the glories of the holy week, which had brought
fifty thousand strangers to Rome; and had got nice and quiet among the
dead in the library of the Vatican.

<p/>Presently, going into Gerard's room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found a hot dispute afoot
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and Jacques Bonaventura. That spark had come in, all steel
from head to toe; doffed helmet, puffed, and railed most scornfully on a
ridiculous ceremony, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaventura</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaventura</b></font>) soldiers had been compelled to
attend the Pope; to wit the blessing of the beasts of burden.

<p/>Gerard said it was not ridiculous; nothing a Pope did could be
ridiculous.

<p/>The argument grew warm, and the friar stood grimly neuter, waiting like
the stork that ate the frog and the mouse at the close of their combat,
to grind them both between the jaws of antiquity; when lo, the curtain
was gently drawn, and there stood a venerable old man in a purple skull
cap, with a beard like white floss silk, looking at them with a kind
though feeble smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy youth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that can heat itself over such matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They all fell on their knees. It was the Pope.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, rise, my children,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>), almost peevishly. <div class="bookquote">``I came not into
this corner to be in state. How goes Plutarch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) work, and kneeling on one knee presented it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
holiness, who had seated himself, the others standing.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) holiness inspected it with interest.

<p/>```Tis excellently writ,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>Gerard's heart beat with delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! this Plutarch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had a wondrous art, Francesco. How each character
standeth out alive on his (<font color='blue'><b>Francesco</b></font>) page: how full of nature each, yet how unlike
his (<font color='blue'><b>Francesco</b></font>) fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacques Bonaventura/Jacques/Bonaventura</b></font>)</div><p/>Jacques Bonaventura. <div class="bookquote">``Give me the Signor Boccaccio.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holiness</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaventura</b></font>) Holiness. <div class="bookquote">``An excellent narrator, capitano, and writeth exquisite
Italian. But in spirit a thought too monotonous. Monks and nuns were
never all unchaste: one or two such stories were right pleasant and
diverting; but five score paint his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) time falsely, and sadden the heart
of such as love mankind. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) hath no skill at characters. Now
this Greek is supreme in that great art: he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) carveth them with pen; and
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) page, see into how real and great a world we enter of war,
and policy, and business, and love in its own place: for with him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>), as in
the great world, men are not all running after a wench. With this great
open field compare me not the narrow garden of Boccaccio, and his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) little
mill-round of dishonest pleasures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your holiness, they say, hath not disdained to write a novel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My holiness hath done more foolish things than one, whereof it repents
too late. When I wrote novels I little thought to be head of the
Church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I search in vain for a copy of it to add to my poor library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well. Then the strict orders I gave four years ago to destroy
every copy in Italy have been well discharged. However, for your
comfort, on my being made Pope, some fool turned it into French: so that
you may read it, at the price of exile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Reduced to this strait we throw ourselves on your holiness's
generosity. Vouchsafe to give us your infallible judgment on it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gently, gently, good Francesco. A Pope's novels are not matters of
faith. I can but give you my sincere impression. Well then the work
in question had, as far as I can remember, all the vices of Boccaccio,
without his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) choice Italian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div><p/>Fra Colonna. <div class="bookquote">``Your holiness is known for slighting Aeneas Silvius as
other men never slighted him (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>). I did him (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) injustice to make you his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>)
judge. Perhaps your holiness will decide more justly between these two
boys-about blessing the beasts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Pope</b></font>)</div><p/>The Pope demurred. In speaking of Plutarch he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had brightened up for
a moment, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) eye had even flashed; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) general manner was as
unlike what youthful females expect in a Pope as you can conceive. I can
only describe it in French. Le gentilhomme blase. A highbred, and
highly cultivated gentleman, who had done, and said, and seen, and
known everything, and whose body was nearly worn out. But double languor
seemed to seize him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) at the father's proposal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor Francesco,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``bethink thee that I have had a life of
controversy, and am sick on't; sick as death. Plutarch drew me to this
calm retreat; not divinity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, but, your holiness, for moderating of strife between two hot young
bloods, -LCB-Makarioi oi eirinopioi-RCB-.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And know you nature so ill, as to think either of these high-mettled
youths will reck what a poor old Pope saith?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! your holiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>broke in Gerard, blushing and gasping, <div class="bookquote">``sure, here
is one who will treasure your words all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) life as words from Heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Pope</b></font>)</div>said the Pope, ``I am fairly caught. As Francesco here
would say--

<p/>-LCB-ouk estin ostis est' anyr eleutheos-RCB-.

<p/>I came to taste that eloquent heathen, dear to me e'en as to thee, thou
paynim monk; and I must talk divinity, or something next door to it.
But the youth hath a good and a winning face, and writeth Greek like an
angel. Well then, my children, to comprehend the ways of the Church, we
should still rise a little above the earth, since the Church is between
heaven and earth, and interprets betwixt them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The question is then, not how vulgar men feel, but how the common
Creator of man and beast doth feel, towards the lower animals. This, if
we are too proud to search for it in the lessons of the Church, the next
best thing is to go to the most ancient history of men and animals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div><p/>Colonna. <div class="bookquote">``Herodotus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay; in this matter Herodotus is but a mushroom. Finely were we
sped for ancient history, if we depended on your Greeks, who did but
write on the last leaf of that great book, Antiquity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The friar</b></font>)</div><p/>The friar groaned. Here was a Pope uttering heresy against his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) demigods.

<p/>```Tis the Vulgate I speak of. A history that handles matters three
thousand years before him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) pedants call `the Father of History.'''

<p/>Colonna. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! the Vulgate? I cry your holiness mercy. How you frightened
me. I quite forgot the Vulgate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgot it? art sure thou ever readst it, Francesco mio?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite, your holiness. `Tis a pleasure I have long promised myself,
the first vacant moment. Hitherto these grand old heathen have left me
small time for recreation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holiness</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) Holiness. ``First then you will find in Genesis that God, having
created the animals, drew a holy pleasure, undefinable by us, from
contemplating of their beauty. Was it wonderful? See their myriad forms;
their lovely hair and eyes, their grace, and of some the power and
majesty: the colour of others, brighter than roses, or rubies. And when,
for man's sin, not their own, they were destroyed, yet were two of each
kind spared.

<p/>``And when the ark and its trembling inmates tumbled solitary on the
world of water, then, saith the word, `God remembered Noah, and the
cattle that were with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in the ark.'

<p/>``Thereafter God did write His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rainbow in the sky as a bond that earth
should be flooded no more; and between whom the bond? between God and
man? nay, between God and man, and every living creature of all flesh:
or my memory fails me with age. In Exodus God commanded that the cattle
should share the sweet blessing of the one day's rest. Moreover He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
`forbade to muzzle the ox that trod out the corn. `Nay, let the poor
overwrought soul snatch a mouthful as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) goes his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) toilsome round: the
bulk of the grain shall still be for man.' Ye will object perchance
that St. Paul, commenting this, saith rudely, `Doth God care for oxen?'
Verily, had I been Peter, instead of the humblest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) successors,
I had answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). `Drop thy theatrical poets, Paul, and read the
Scriptures: then shalt thou know whether God careth only for men and
sparrows, or for all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) creatures. O, Paul,' had I made bold to say,
`think not to learn God by looking into Paul's heart, nor any heart of
man, but study that which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hath revealed concerning himself.'

<p/>``Thrice he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forbade the Jews to boil the kid in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's milk; not
that this is cruelty, but want of thought and gentle sentiments, and so
paves the way for downright cruelty. A prophet riding on an ass did
meet an angel. Which of these two, Paulo judice, had seen the heavenly
spirit? marry, the prophet. But it was not so. The man, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vision
cloyed with sin, saw nought. The poor despised creature saw all. Nor is
this recorded as miraculous. Poor proud things, we overrate ourselves.
The angel had slain the prophet and spared the ass, but for that
creature's clearer vision of essences divine. He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) said so, methinks.
But in sooth I read it many years agone. Why did God spare repentant
Nineveh? Because in that city were sixty thousand children, besides much
cattle.

<p/>``Profane history and vulgar experience add their mite of witness. The
cruel to animals end in cruelty to man; and strange and violent deaths,
marked with retribution's bloody finger, have in all ages fallen from
heaven on such as wantonly harm innocent beasts. This I myself have
seen. All this duly weighed, and seeing that, despite this Francesco's
friends, the Stoics, who in their vanity say the creatures all subsist
for man's comfort, there be snakes and scorpions which kill `Dominum
terra' with a nip, musquitoes which eat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) piecemeal, and tigers and
sharks which crack him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like an almond, we do well to be grateful to
these true, faithful, patient, four-footed friends, which, in lieu of
powdering us, put forth their strength to relieve our toils, and do feed
us like mothers from their gentle dugs.

<p/>``Methinks then the Church is never more divine than in this benediction
of our four-footed friends, which has revolted you great theological
authority, the captain of the Pope's guards; since here she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) inculcates
humility and gratitude, and rises towards the level of the mind divine,
and interprets God to man, God the Creator, parent, and friend of man
and beast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But all this, young gentles, you will please to receive, not as
delivered by the Pope ex cathedra, but uttered carelessly, in a free
hour, by an aged clergyman. On that score you will perhaps do well to
entertain it with some little consideration. For old age must surely
bring a man somewhat, in return for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) digestion -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) `dura puerorum
ilia,' eh, Francesco!-RRB-, which it carries away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Pope</b></font>)</div><p/>Such was the purport of the Pope's discourse but the manner high bred,
languid, kindly, and free from all tone of dictation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) seemed to be
gently probing the matter in concert with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) hearers, not playing
Sir Oracle. At the bottom of all which was doubtless a slight touch of
humbug, but the humbug that embellishes life; and all sense of it was
lost in the subtle Italian grace of the thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I seem to hear the oracle of Delphi,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div>said Fra Colonna
enthusiastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I call that good sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques Bonaventura/Jacques/Bonaventura</b></font>)</div>shouted Jacques Bonaventura.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, captain, good sense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, with a deep and tender reproach.

<p/>The Pope smiled on Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Cavil not at words; that was an unheard
of concession from a rival theologian.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) then asked for all Gerard's
work, and took it away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand. But before going, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gently pulled
Fra Colonna's ear, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) remembered when they were
school-fellows together and robbed the Virgin by the roadside of the
money dropped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) box. <div class="bookquote">``You took a flat stick and applied bird-lime
to the top, and drew the money out through the chink, you rogue,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) holiness severely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To every signor his (<font color='blue'><b>theologian</b></font>) own honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div>replied Fra Colonna. <div class="bookquote">``It was your
holiness's good wit invented the manoeuvre. I was but the humble
instrument.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well. Doubtless you know `twas sacrilege.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of the first water; but I did it in such good company, it troubles me
not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! I have not even that poor consolation. What did we spend it in,
dost mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can your holiness ask? why, sugar-plums.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, all on't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every doit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are delightful reminiscences, my Francesco. Alas! I am getting
old. I shall not be here long. And I am sorry for it, for thy sake. They
will go and burn thee when I am gone. Art far more a heretic than Huss,
whom I saw burned with these eyes; and oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Huss</b></font>) died like a martyr.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, your holiness; but I believe in the Pope; and Huss did not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fox! They will not burn thee; wood is too dear. Adieu, old playmate;
adieu, young gentlemen; an old man's blessing be on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Pope</b></font>)</div><p/>That afternoon the Pope's secretary brought Gerard a little bag: in it
were several gold pieces.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) store.

<p/>Margaret seemed nearer and nearer.

<p/>For some time past, too, it appeared as if the fairies had watched over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Baskets of choice provisions and fruits were brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) door by
porters, who knew not who had employed them, or affected ignorance; and
one day came a jewel in a letter, but no words.



<p/>CHAPTER LXI

<p/>The Princess Claelia ordered a full-length portrait of herself. Gerard
advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) to employ his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friend Pietro Vanucci.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) declined. ```Twill be time to put a slight on the Gerardo, when
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerardo</b></font>) work discontents me.'' Then Gerard, who knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was an excellent
draughtsman, but not so good a colourist, begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) to stand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
as a Roman statue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) how closely he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could mimic marble
on paper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) consented at first; but demurred when this enthusiast
explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) must wear the tunic, toga, and sandals of the
ancients.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I had as lieve be presented in my smock,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), with mediaeval
frankness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack! signorina,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``you have surely never noted the
ancient habit; so free, so ample, so simple, yet so noble; and most
becoming your highness, to whom Heaven hath given the Roman features,
and eke a shapely arm and hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in modern guise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, can you flatter, like the rest, Gerardo? Well, give me time to
think on't. Come o' Saturday, and then I will say ay or nay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The respite thus gained was passed in making the tunic and toga, etc.,
and trying them on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) chamber, to see whether they suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) style
of beauty well enough to compensate their being a thousand years out of
date.

<p/>Gerard, hurrying along to this interview, was suddenly arrested, and
rooted to earth at a shop window.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) quick eye had discerned in that window a copy of Lactantius lying
open. <div class="bookquote">``That is fairly writ, anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyed it a moment more with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>It was not written at all. It was printed.

<p/>Gerard groaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sped; mine enemy is at the door. The press is in Rome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went into the shop, and affecting nonchalance, inquired how long the
printing-press had been in Rome. The man said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed there was no
such thing in the city. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, the Lactantius; that was printed on the top
of the Apennines.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, did the printing-press fall down there out o' the moon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, messer,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>said the trader, laughing; <div class="bookquote">``it shot up there out of
Germany. See the title-page!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard took the Lactantius eagerly, and saw the following--

<p/>Opera et impensis Sweynheim et Pannartz
Alumnorum Joannis Fust.
Impressum Subiacis. A.D. 1465.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will ye buy, messer? See how fair and even be the letters. Few are left
can write like that; and scarce a quarter of the price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would fain have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard sadly, <div class="bookquote">``but my heart will not let
me. Know that I am a caligraph, and these disciples of Fust run after me
round the world a-taking the bread out of my mouth. But I wish them no
ill. Heaven forbid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hurried from the shop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to himself, <div class="bookquote">``we must lose no time; we must
make our hay while shines the sun. One month more and an avalanche of
printer's type shall roll down on Rome from those Apennines, and lay us
waste that writers be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) almost ran to the Princess Claelia.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was ushered into an apartment new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). It was not very large,
but most luxurious; a fountain played in the centre, and the floor was
covered with the skins of panthers, dressed with the hair, so that no
footfall could be heard. The room was an ante-chamber to the princess's
boudoir, for on one side there was no door, but an ample curtain of
gorgeous tapestry.

<p/>Here Gerard was left alone till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) became quite uneasy, and doubted
whether the maid had not shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to the wrong place.

<p/>These doubts were agreeably dissipated.

<p/>A light step came swiftly behind the curtain; it parted in the middle,
and there stood a figure the heathens might have worshipped. It was not
quite Venus, nor quite Minerva; but between the two; nobler than Venus,
more womanly than Jupiter's daughter. Toga, tunic, sandals; nothing was
modern. And as for beauty, that is of all times.

<p/>Gerard started up, and all the artist in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) flushed with pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried innocently, and gazed in rapture.

<p/>This added the last charm to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) model: a light blush tinted her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) cheeks,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) eyes brightened, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) mouth smiled with delicious complacency
at this genuine tribute to her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) charms.

<p/>When they had looked at one another so some time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) saw Gerard's
eloquence was confined to ejaculating and gazing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
Gerardo, thou seest I have made myself an antique monster for thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A monster? I doubt Fra Colonna would fall down and adore your highness,
seeing you so habited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I care not to be adored by an old man. I would liever be loved by
a young one: of my own choosing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pencils, arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) canvas, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had covered
with stout paper, and set to work; and so absorbed was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had
no mercy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) model. At last, after near an hour in one posture,
<div class="bookquote">``Gerardo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) faintly, <div class="bookquote">``I can stand so no more, even for thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down and rest awhile, Signora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>); and sinking into a chair turned pale and
sighed.

<p/>Gerard was alarmed, and saw also he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been inconsiderate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took
water from the fountain and was about to throw it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) face; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>)
put up a white hand deprecatingly: <div class="bookquote">``Nay, hold it to my brow with thine
hand: prithee, do not fling it at me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard timidly and hesitating applied his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wet hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) brow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) sighed, <div class="bookquote">``that is reviving. Again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) applied it again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to ring a little
hand-bell on the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did so, and a maid came, and was sent to
Floretta with orders to bring a large fan.

<p/>Floretta speedily came with the fan.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) no sooner came near the princess, than that lady's highbred nostrils
suddenly expanded like a bloodhorse's. <div class="bookquote">``Wretch!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>); and rising
up with a sudden return to vigour, seized Floretta with her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) left hand,
twisted it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) hair, and with the right hand boxed her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) ears severely
three times.

<p/>Floretta screamed and blubbered; but obtained no mercy.

<p/>The antique toga left quite disengaged a bare arm, that now seemed as
powerful as it was beautiful: it rose and fell like the piston of a
modern steam-engine, and heavy slaps resounded one after another on
Floretta's shoulders; the last one drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) sobbing and screaming
through the curtain, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) was heard crying bitterly for some
time after.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Saints of heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``what is amiss? what has she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) knows right well. `Tis not the first time. The nasty toad! I'll
learn her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to come to me stinking of the musk-cat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! Signora, `twas a small fault, methinks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A small fault? Nay, `twas a foul fault.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) added with an amazing
sudden descent to humility and sweetness, <div class="bookquote">``Are you wroth with me for
beating her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), Gerar-do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Signora, it ill becomes me to school you; but methinks such as Heaven
appoints to govern others should govern themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true, Gerardo. How wise you are, to be so young.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) then
called the other maid, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) a little purse. <div class="bookquote">``Take that to
Floretta, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) `the Gerardo' hath interceded for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); and so I
must needs forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). There, Gerardo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard coloured all over at the compliment; but not knowing how to
turn a phrase equal to the occasion, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should resume her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>)
picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet; beating that hussy hath somewhat breathed me. I'll sit awhile,
and you shall talk to me. I know you can talk, an it pleases you, as
rarely as you draw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That were easily done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do it then, Gerardo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard was taken aback.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, signora, I know not what to say. This is sudden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say your real mind. Say you wish you were anywhere but here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, signora, that would not be sooth. I wish one thing though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, and what is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could have drawn you as you were beating that poor lass. You
were awful, yet lovely. Oh, what a subject for a Pythoness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerardo</b></font>) thinks but of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerardo</b></font>) art. And why keep such a coil about my
beauty, Gerardo? You are far fairer than I am. You are more like Apollo
than I to Venus. Also, you have lovely hair and lovely eyes--but you
know not what to do with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, do I. To draw you, signora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes; you can see my features with them; but you cannot see what any
Roman gallant had seen long ago in your place. Yet sure you must have
noted how welcome you are to me, Gerardo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can see your highness is always passing kind to me; a poor stranger
like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not, Gerardo. I have often been cold to you; rude sometimes;
and you are so simple you see not the cause. Alas! I feared for my own
heart. I feared to be your slave. I who have hitherto made slaves. Ah!
Gerardo, I am unhappy. Ever since you came here I have lived upon
your visits. The day you are to come I am bright. The other days I am
listless, and wish them fled. You are not like the Roman gallants. You
make me hate them. You are ten times braver to my eye; and you are
wise and scholarly, and never flatter and lie. I scorn a man that lies.
Gerar-do, teach me thy magic; teach me to make thee as happy by my side
as I am still by thine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>) poured out these strange words, the princess's mellow voice sunk
almost to a whisper, and trembled with half-suppressed passion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Floretta</b></font>)
white hand stole timidly yet earnestly down Gerard's arm, till it rested
like a soft bird upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wrist, and as ready to fly away at a word.

<p/>Destitute of vanity and experience, wrapped up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) Margaret and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
art, Gerard had not seen this revelation coming, though it had come by
regular and visible gradations.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) blushed all over. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) innocent admiration of the regal beauty that
besieged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), did not for a moment displace the absent Margaret's image.
Yet it was regal beauty, and wooing with a grace and tenderness he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had
never even figured in imagination. How to check her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) without wounding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) blushed and trembled.

<p/>The siren saw, and encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Gerardo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``fear not; none shall ever harm thee under
my wing. Wilt not speak to me, Gerar-do mio?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Signora!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>muttered Gerard deprecatingly.

<p/>At this moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eye, lowered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) confusion, fell on the shapely
white arm and delicate hand that curled round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) elbow like a tender
vine, and it flashed across him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had just seen that lovely limb
employed on Floretta.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) trembled and blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess, <div class="bookquote">``I scare him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilt</b></font>). Am I then so very terrible? Is
it my Roman robe? I'll doff it, and habit me as when thou first camest
to me. Mindest thou? `Twas to write a letter to yon barren knight Ercole
d’Orsini. Shall I tell thee? `twas the sight of thee, and thy pretty
ways, and thy wise words, made me hate him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on the instant. I liked the
fool well enough before; or wist I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). Tell me now how many times
hast thou been here since then. Ah! thou knowest not; lovest me not, I
doubt, as I love thee. Eighteen times, Gerardo. And each time dearer
to me. The day thou comest not `tis night, not day, to Claelia. Alas!
I speak for both. Cruel boy, am I not worth a word? Hast every day a
princess at thy feet? Nay, prithee, prithee, speak to me, Gerar-do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Signora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>faltered Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``what can I say, that were not better left
unsaid? Oh, evil day that ever I came here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! say not so. `Twas the brightest day ever shone on me or indeed on
thee. I'll make thee confess so much ere long, ungrateful one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your highness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>began Gerard, in a low, pleading voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call me Claelia, Gerar-do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Signora, I am too young and too little wise to know how I ought to
speak to you, so as not to seem blind nor yet ungrateful. But this I
know, I were both naught and ungrateful, and the worst foe e'er you had,
did I take advantage of this mad fancy. Sure some ill spirit hath had
leave to afflict you withal. For `tis all unnatural that a princess
adorned with every grace should abase her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) affections on a churl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The princess</b></font>)</div><p/>The princess withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hand slowly from Gerard's wrist.

<p/>Yet as it passed lightly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arm it seemed to linger a moment at
parting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You fear the daggers of my kinsmen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), half sadly, half
contemptuously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more than I fear the bodkins of your women,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard haughtily.
<div class="bookquote">``But I fear God and the saints, and my own conscience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth, Gerardo, the truth! Hypocrisy sits awkwardly on thee.
Princesses, while they are young, are not despised for love of God, but
of some other woman. Tell me whom thou lovest; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is worthy thee
I will forgive thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in Italy, upon my soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! there is one somewhere then. Where? where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Holland, my native country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Marie de Bourgoyne is fair, they say. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) is but a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Princess, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) I love is not noble. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) is as I am. Nor is she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) so
fair as thou. Yet is she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) fair; and linked to my heart for ever by her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)
virtues, and by all the dangers and griefs we have borne together, and
for one another. Forgive me; but I would not wrong my Margaret for all
the highest dames in Italy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The slighted beauty started to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) feet, and stood opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), as
beautiful, but far more terrible than when she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) slapped Floretta, for
then her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) cheeks were red, but now they were pale, and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) eyes full of
concentrated fury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This to my face, unmannered wretch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Was I born to be
insulted, as well as scorned, by such as thou? Beware! We nobles brook
no rivals. Bethink thee whether is better, the love of a Cesarini, or
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hate: for after all I have said and done to thee, it must be love or
hate between us, and to the death. Choose now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) with wonder and awe, as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) stood towering over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) Roman toga, offering this strange alternative.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) seemed to have affronted a goddess of antiquity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a poor puny
mortal.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sighed deeply, but spoke not.

<p/>Perhaps something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) deep and patient sigh touched a tender chord in
that ungoverned creature; or perhaps the time had come for one passion
to ebb and another to flow. The princess sank languidly into a seat, and
the tears began to steal rapidly down her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Weep not, sweet lady; your tears they
do accuse me, and I am like to weep for company. My kind patron, be
yourself; you will live to see how much better a friend I was to you
than I seemed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see it now, Gerardo,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess. <div class="bookquote">``Friend is the word! the
only word can ever pass between us twain. I was mad. Any other man had
ta’en advantage of my folly. You must teach me to be your friend and
nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard hailed this proposition with joy; and told her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) out of Cicero how
godlike a thing was friendship, and how much better and rarer and more
lasting than love: to prove to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was capable of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) even told
her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) about Denys and himself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) listened with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) eyes half shut, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) words to fathom his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
character, and learn his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) weak point.

<p/>At last, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) calmly thus: <div class="bookquote">``Leave me now, Gerardo, and come
as usual to-morrow. You will find your lesson well bestowed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) kissed it; and went away pondering
deeply this strange interview, and wondering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had done
prudently or not.

<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was received with marked distance, and the princess
stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) literally like a statue, and after a very short
sitting, excused herself and dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Gerard felt the chilling
difference; but said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) is wise.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) way.

<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found the princess waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) surrounded by young
nobles flattering her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to the skies. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) and they treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) like a
dog that could do one little trick they could not. The cavaliers in
particular criticised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) work with a mass of ignorance and insolence
combined that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cheeks burn.

<p/>The princess watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face demurely with half-closed eyes at each
sting the insects gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); and when they had fled, had her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) doors closed
against every one of them for their pains.

<p/>The next day Gerard found her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) alone: cold and silent. After standing to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) so some time, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You treated my company with less respect
than became you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I, Signora?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you? you fired up at the comments they did you the honour to make
on your work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I said nought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>observed Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, high looks speak as plain as high words. Your cheeks were red as
blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was nettled a moment at seeing so much ignorance and ill-nature
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now it is me, their hostess, you affront.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, Signora, and acquit me of design. It would ill become me to
affront the kindest patron and friend I have in Rome but one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How humble we are all of a sudden. In sooth, Ser Gerardo, you are a
capital feigner. You can insult or truckle at will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truckle? to whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To me, for one; to one, whom you affronted for a base-born girl like
yourself; but whose patronage you claim all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard rose, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart. <div class="bookquote">``These are biting words,
signora. Have I really deserved them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what are words to an adventurer like you? cold steel is all you
fear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am no swashbuckler, yet I have met steel with steel and methinks I
had rather face your kinsmen's swords than your cruel tongue, lady. Why
do you use me so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerar-do, for no good reason, but because I am wayward, and shrewish,
and curst, and because everybody admires me but you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I admire you too, Signora. Your friends may flatter you more; but
believe me they have not the eye to see half your charms. Their babble
yesterday showed me that. None admire you more truly, or wish you
better, than the poor artist, who might not be your lover, but hoped
to be your friend; but no, I see that may not be between one so high as
you, and one so low as I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! but it shall, Gerardo,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``I will not be
so curst. Tell me now where abides thy Margaret; and I will give thee a
present for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); and on that you and I will be friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is a daughter of a physician called Peter, and they bide at
Sevenbergen; ah me, shall I e'er see it again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis well. Now go.'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) somewhat abruptly.

<p/>Poor Gerard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) began to wade in deep waters when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) encountered this
Italian princess; callida et calida selis filia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) resolved to go no
more when once he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) likeness. Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) now regretted
having undertaken so long and laborious a task.

<p/>This resolution was shaken for a moment by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) next reception, which was
all gentleness and kindness.

<p/>After standing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) some time in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) toga, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was fatigued,
and wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) assistance in another way: would he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) teach her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to draw a
little? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), and taught her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to make easy lines. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
found her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) wonderfully apt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a teacher before thee, Gerar-do. Ay, and one as handsome as
thyself.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) then went to a drawer, and brought out several heads
drawn with a complete ignorance of the art, but with great patience and
natural talent. They were all heads of Gerard, and full of spirit; and
really not unlike. One was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) very image. <div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now thou
seest who was my teacher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I, signora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, know you not who teaches us women to do all things? `Tis love,
Gerar-do. Love made me draw because thou draweth, Gerar-do. Love prints
thine image in my bosom. My fingers touch the pen, and love supplies the
want of art, and lo thy beloved features lie upon the paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes with astonishment at this return to an
interdicted topic. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Signora, you promised me to be friends and
nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) laughed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``How simple you are: who believes a woman
promising nonsense, impossibilities? Friendship, foolish boy, who
ever built that temple on red ashes? Nay Gerardo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) added gloomily,
<div class="bookquote">``between thee and me it must be love or hate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which you will, signora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard firmly. <div class="bookquote">``But for me I will
neither love nor hate you; but with your permission I will leave you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rose abruptly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) rose too, pale as death, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Ere thou leavest me so, know thy
fate; outside that door are armed men who wait to slay thee at a word
from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will not speak that word, signora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That word I will speak. Nay, more, I shall noise it abroad it was for
proffering brutal love to me thou wert slain; and I will send a special
messenger to Sevenbergen: a cunning messenger, well taught his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lesson.
Thy Margaret shall know thee dead, and think thee faithless; now, go to
thy grave; a dog's. For a man thou art not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard turned pale, and stood dumb-stricken. <div class="bookquote">``God have mercy on us
both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, have thou mercy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and on thyself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) will never know in

Come, yield thee, Gerar-do mio: what will it cost thee to say thou
lovest me? I ask thee but to feign it handsomely. Thou art young: die
not for the poor pleasure of denying a lady what-the shadow of a heart.
Who will shed a tear for thee? I tell thee men will laugh, not weep
over thy tombstone-ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) ended in a little scream, for Gerard threw
himself in a moment at her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) feet, and poured out in one torrent of
eloquence the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) love and Margaret's. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been
imprisoned, hunted with bloodhounds for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), driven to exile for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>);
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had shed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) blood for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and now pined at home. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
had walked through Europe environed by perils, torn by savage brutes,
attacked by furious men with sword and axe and trap, robbed, shipwrecked
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>The princess trembled, and tried to get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) held
her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) robe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pitiful story and
Margaret's; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand, and clasped it between both his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
tears fell fast on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) implored her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to think on all the
woes of the true lovers she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would part; and what but remorse, swift
and lasting, could come of so deep a love betrayed, and so false a love
feigned, with mutual hatred lurking at the bottom.

<p/>In such moments none ever resisted Gerard.

<p/>The princess, after in vain trying to get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) felt
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) power over her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), began to waver, and sigh, and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) bosom to rise and
fall tumultuously, and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) fiery eyes to fill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You conquer me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) sobbed. <div class="bookquote">``You, or my better angel. Leave Rome!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you breathe a word of my folly, it will be your last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think not so poorly of me. You are my benefactress once more. Is it for
me to slander you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go! I will send you the means. I know myself; if you cross my path
again, I shall kill you. Addio; my heart is broken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) bell. <div class="bookquote">``Floretta,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), in a choked voice, <div class="bookquote">``take him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)
safe out of the house, through my chamber, and by the side postern.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned at the door; she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was leaning with one hand on a chair, crying,
with averted head. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought only of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) kindness, and ran back
and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) robe. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) never moved.

<p/>Once clear of the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) darted home, thanking Heaven for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) escape,
soul and body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Landlady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``there is one would pick a quarrel with me. What is

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strike him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) first, and at vantage! Get behind him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>); and then draw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, I lack your Italian courage. To be serious, `tis a noble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, holy saints, that is another matter. Change thy lodging awhile, and

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) then took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) own niece, who let lodgings at some little
distance, and installed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) there.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had little to do now, and no princess to draw, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) set himself
resolutely to read that deed of Floris Brandt, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) had
hitherto been driven by the abominably bad writing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) mastered it, and
saw at once that the loan on this land must have been paid over and over
again by the rents, and that Ghysbrecht was keeping Peter Brandt out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fool! not to have read this before,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) cried. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) hired a horse and
rode down to the nearest port. A vessel was to sail for Amsterdam in
four days.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) took a passage; and paid a small sum to secure it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The land is too full of cut-throats for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and `tis lovely
fair weather for the sea. Our Dutch skippers are not shipwrecked like
these bungling Italians.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) returned home there sat his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) old landlady with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) eyes
sparkling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are in luck, my young master,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``All the fish run to your

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard broke the seals, and found it full of silver crowns. The letter
contained a mere slip of paper with this line, cut out of some MS.:--<div class="bookquote">``La

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fear me not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard aloud. <div class="bookquote">``I'll keep mine between my teeth.''

round her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I trow nothing could make you happier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A stranger; a painter, with a reddish face and an outlandish name;

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I'd have my tongue cut out sooner than betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), but oh, it was

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, is it, lad; and no farther off than my pocket. Come out, Gerard's

<p/>Gerard threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) neck and hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My best friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), ``my second mother, I'll read it to you.

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor woman sighed and rocked herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And must be the one to bring it thee all smiling and smirking? I could

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard staggered against the window sill. <div class="bookquote">``But He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is master of death,''

his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) murdering falsehood down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) throat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hat and ran furiously about the streets for hours.

<p/>Towards sunset he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came back white as a ghost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had not found Memling;
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) poor mind had had time to realise the woman's simple words, that
Death spares none.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) crept into the house bent, and feeble as an old man, and refused
all food. Nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) speak, but sat, white, with great staring eyes,
muttering at intervals, <div class="bookquote">``There is no God.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alarmed both on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) account
and on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked a desperate maniac-RRB-, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) landlady ran for
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) aunt.

<p/>The good dame came, and the two women, braver together, sat one on each
side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and tried to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with kind and consoling voices.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heeded them no more than the chairs they sat on. Then the younger
held a crucifix out before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), to aid her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Maria, mother of heaven,
comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they sighed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat glaring, deaf to all external
sounds.

<p/>Presently, without any warning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) jumped up, struck the crucifix rudely
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) way with a curse, and made a headlong dash at the door. The
poor women shrieked. But ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reached the door, something seemed to
them to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) up straight by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hair, and twirl him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) round like a
top. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) whirled twice round with arms extended; then fell like a dead
log upon the floor, with blood trickling from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nostrils and ears.



<p/>CHAPTER XLII

<p/>Gerard returned to consciousness and to despair.

<p/>On the second day he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was raving with fever on the brain.

<p/>On a table hard by lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rich auburn hair, long as a woman's.

<p/>The deadlier symptoms succeeded one another rapidly.

<p/>On the fifth day his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) leech retired and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) up.

<p/>On the sunset of that same day he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fell into a deep sleep.

<p/>Some said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would wake only to die.

<p/>But an old gossip, whose opinion carried weight -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been a
professional nurse-RRB-, declared that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) youth might save him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) yet, could
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sleep twelve hours.

<p/>On this his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) old landlady cleared the room and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)
vowed a wax candle to the Virgin for every hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should sleep.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) slept twelve hours.

<p/>The good soul rejoiced, and thanked the Virgin on her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) knees.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) slept twenty-four hours.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) kind nurse began to doubt. At the thirtieth hour she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) sent for the
woman of art.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty hours! shall we wake him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The other inspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) closely for some time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) breath is even, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand moist. I know there be learned leeches
would wake him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tongue, and be none the wiser; but we
that be women should have the sense to let bon Nature alone. When did
sleep ever harm the racked brain or the torn heart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been forty-eight hours asleep, it got wind, and they had
much ado to keep the curious out. But they admitted only Fra Colonna and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) friend the gigantic Fra Jerome.

<p/>These two relieved the women, and sat silent; the former eyeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>)
young friend with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) eyes, the latter with beads in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>)
hand looked as calmly on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) had on the sea when Gerard and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
encountered it hand to hand.

<p/>At last, I think it was about the sixtieth hour of this strange sleep,
the landlady touched Fra Colonna with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) elbow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) looked. Gerard had
opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes as gently as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been but dozing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stared.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) drew himself up a little in bed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head, and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hair was gone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) noticed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friend Colonna, and smiled with pleasure.

<p/>But in the middle of smiling his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face stopped, and was convulsed in a
moment with anguish unspeakable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) uttered a loud cry, and turned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face to the wall.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) good landlady wept at this. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had known what it is to awake
bereaved.

<p/>Fra Jerome recited canticles, and prayers from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) breviary.

<p/>Gerard rolled himself in the bed-clothes.

<p/>Fra Colonna went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>), and whimpering, reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) that all was not
lost. The divine Muses were immortal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) must transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) affection to
them; they would never betray him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) nor fail him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) like creatures of clay.
The good, simple father then hurried away; for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was overcome by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
emotion.

<p/>Fra Jerome remained behind. <div class="bookquote">``Young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the Muses exist but
in the brains of pagans and visionaries. The Church alone gives repose
to the heart on earth, and happiness to the soul hereafter. Hath earth
deceived thee, hath passion broken thy heart after tearing it, the
Church opens her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) arms: consecrate thy gifts to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)! The Church is peace
of mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) spoke these words solemnly at the door, and was gone as soon as they
were uttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Church!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>cried Gerard, rising furiously, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fist after
the friar. <div class="bookquote">``Malediction on the Church! But for the Church I should
not lie broken here, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lie cold, cold, cold, in Holland. Oh, my
Margaret! oh, my darling! my darling! And I must run from thee the few
months thou hadst to live. Cruel! cruel! The monsters, they let her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) die.
Death comes not without some signs. These the blind selfish wretches saw
not, or recked not; but I had seen them, I that love her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Oh, had I been
there, I had saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), I had saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Idiot! idiot! to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) for
a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wept bitterly a long time.

<p/>Then, suddenly bursting into rage again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried vehemently <div class="bookquote">``The
Church! for whose sake I was driven from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); my malison be on the
Church! and the hypocrites that name it to my broken heart. Accursed be
the world! Ghysbrecht lives; Margaret dies. Thieves, murderers, harlots,
live for ever. Only angels die. Curse life! curse death! and whosoever
made them what they are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The friar did not hear these mad and wicked words; but only the yell of
rage with which they were flung after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>It was as well. For, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had heard them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) late
shipmate burned in the forum with as little hesitation as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would have
roasted a kid.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) old landlady who had accompanied Fra Colonna down the stair, heard
the raised voice, and returned in some anxiety.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) found Gerard putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) clothes, and crying.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) remonstrated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What avails my lying here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``Can I find here that
which I seek?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saints preserve us! Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) distraught again? What seek ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oblivion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oblivion, my little heart? Oh, but y’are young to talk so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Young or old, what else have I to live for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) best clothes.

<p/>The good dame remonstrated. <div class="bookquote">``My pretty Gerard, know that it is Tuesday,
not Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tuesday is it? I thought it had been Saturday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, thou hast slept long. Thou never wearest thy brave clothes on
working days. Consider.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I did, when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lived, I did. Now I shall do whatever erst I did
not. The past is the past. There lies my hair, and with it my way of
life. I have served one Master as well as I could. You see my reward.
Now I'll serve another, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) a fair trial too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>sighed the woman, turning pale, <div class="bookquote">``what mean these dark words? and
what new master is this whose service thou wouldst try?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``SATAN.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div><p/>And with this horrible declaration on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lips the miserable creature
walked out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cap and feather set jauntily on one side, and feeble
limbs, and a sinister face pale as ashes, and all drawn down as if by
age.



<p/>CHAPTER LXIII

<p/>A dark cloud fell on a noble mind.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pure and unrivalled love for Margaret had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) polar star. It
was quenched, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) drifted on the gloomy sea of no hope.

<p/>Nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a prey to despair alone, but to exasperation at all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
self-denial, fortitude, perils, virtue, wasted and worse than wasted;
for it kept burning and stinging him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), that, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stayed lazily,
selfishly at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should have saved his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) Margaret's life.

<p/>These two poisons, raging together in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) young blood, maddened and
demoralized him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rushed fiercely into pleasure. And in those days,
even more than now, pleasure was vice. Wine, women, gambling, whatever
could procure him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) an hour's excitement and a moment's oblivion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
plunged into these things, as men tired of life have rushed among the
enemy's bullets.

<p/>The large sums he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had put by for Margaret gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ample means for
debauchery, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was soon the leader of those loose companions he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had
hitherto kept at a distance.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart deteriorated along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) morals.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sulked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) old landlady for thrusting gentle advice and warning
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); and finally removed to another part of the town, to be clear of
remonstrance and reminiscences. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had carried this game on some
time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand became less steady, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could no longer write to
satisfy himself. Moreover, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) patience declined as the habits of
pleasure grew on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). So he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) gave up that art, and took likenesses in
colours.

<p/>But this he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) neglected whenever the idle rakes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) companions, came for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dived in foul waters, seeking that sorry oyster-shell,
Oblivion.

<p/>It is not my business to paint at full length the scenes of coarse vice
in which this unhappy young man now played a part. But it is my business
to impress the broad truth, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a rake, a debauchee, and a
drunkard, and one of the wildest, loosest, and wickedest young men in
Rome.

<p/>They are no lovers of truth, nor of mankind, who conceal or slur the
wickedness of the good, and so by their want of candour rob despondent
sinners of hope.

<p/>Enough, the man was not born to do things by halves. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not
vicious by halves.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) humble female friends often gossiped about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old landlady
told Teresa he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to the bad, and prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) to try and find out
where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was.

<p/>Teresa told her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) husband Lodovico his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sad story, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look about
and see if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could discover the young man's present abode. <div class="bookquote">``Shouldst
remember his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) face, Lodovico mio?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Teresa, a man in my way of life never forgets a face, least of all a
benefactor's. But thou knowest I seldom go abroad by daylight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa mia</b></font>)</div><p/>Teresa sighed. <div class="bookquote">``And how long is it to be so, Lodovico?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Till some cavalier passes his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) sword through me. They will not let a
poor fellow like me take to any honest trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pietro Vanucci/Vanucci</b></font>)</div><p/>Pietro Vanucci was one of those who bear prosperity worse than
adversity.

<p/>Having been ignominiously ejected for late hours by their old landlady,
and meeting Gerard in the street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) warmly, and soon after
took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) quarters in the same house.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a lad called Andrea, who ground his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) colours, and
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pupil, and also his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) model, being a youth of rare beauty, and as
sharp as a needle.

<p/>Pietro had not quite forgotten old times, and professed a warm
friendship for Gerard.

<p/>Gerard, in whom all warmth of sentiment seemed extinct, submitted coldly
to the other's friendship.

<p/>And a fine acquaintance it was. This Pietro was not only a libertine,
but half a misanthrope, and an open infidel.

<p/>And so they ran in couples, with mighty little in common. O, rare
phenomenon!

<p/>One day, when Gerard had undermined his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) health, and taken the bloom
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) beauty, and run through most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) money, Vanucci got up a
gay party to mount the Tiber in a boat drawn by buffaloes. Lorenzo de'
Medici had imported these creatures into Florence about three years
before. But they were new in Rome, and nothing would content this beggar
on horseback, Vanucci, but being drawn by the brutes up the Tiber.

<p/>Each libertine was to bring a lady and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must be handsome, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>)
be fined. But the one that should contribute the loveliest was to be
crowned with laurel, and voted a public benefactor. Such was their
reading of <div class="bookquote">``Vir bonus est quis?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They got a splendid galley, and twelve
buffaloes. And all the libertines and their female accomplices assembled
by degrees at the place of embarkation. But no Gerard.

<p/>They waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) some time, at first patiently, then impatiently.

<p/>Vanucci excused him (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) say he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had forgotten to provide
himself with a fardingale. Comrades, the good lad is hunting for
a beauty fit to take rank among these peerless dames. Consider the
difficulty, ladies, and be patient!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>At last Gerard was seen at some distance with a female in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is long enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one of her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) sex, criticising her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) from afar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gemini! what steps she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) takes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! it is wise to hurry
into good company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div>was Pietro's excuse.

<p/>But when the pair came up, satire was choked.

<p/>Gerard's companion was a peerless beauty; she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) extinguished the
boat-load, as stars the rising sun. Tall, but not too tall; and straight
as a dart, yet supple as a young panther. Her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) face a perfect oval, her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)
forehead white, her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) cheeks a rich olive with the eloquent blood mantling
below and her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) glorious eyes fringed with long thick silken eyelashes,
that seemed made to sweep up sensitive hearts by the half dozen. Saucy
red lips, and teeth of the whitest ivory.

<p/>The women were visibly depressed by this wretched sight; the men in
ecstasies; they received her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) with loud shouts and waving of caps, and
one enthusiast even went down on his (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) knees upon the boat's gunwale, and
hailed her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) of origin divine. But his (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) chere amie pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) hair for
it--and the goddess giving him (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) a little kick--cotemporaneously, he (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) lay
supine; and the peerless creature frisked over his (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) body without deigning
him (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) a look, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) seat at the prow. Pietro Vanucci sat in a sort
of collapse, glaring at her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>), and gaping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) mouth open like a dying
cod-fish.

<p/>The drover spoke to the buffaloes, the ropes tightened, and they moved
up stream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What think ye of this new beef, mesdames?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We ne’er saw monsters so viley ill-favoured; with their nasty horns
that make one afeard, and, their foul nostrils cast up into the air.
Holes be they; not nostrils.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Signorina, the beeves are a present from Florence the beautiful Would
ye look a gift beef i' the nose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are so dull,''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>objected a lively lady. <div class="bookquote">``I went up Tiber twice as
fast last time with but five mules and an ass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, that is soon mended,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried a gallant, and jumping ashore he (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) drew
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) sword, and despite the remonstrances of the drivers, went down the
dozen buffaloes goading them.

<p/>They snorted and whisked their tails, and went no faster, at which the
boat-load laughed loud and long: finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) goaded a patriarch bull,
who turned instantly on the sword, sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) long horns clean through the
spark, and with a furious jerk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) prodigious neck sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) flying
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) head into the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) described a bold parabola and fell
sitting, and unconsciously waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) glittering blade, into the yellow
Tiber. The laughing ladies screamed and wrung their hands, all but
Gerard's fair. She (<font color='blue'><b>ladies</b></font>) uttered something very like an oath, and seizing the
helm steered the boat out, and the gallant came up sputtering, griped
the gunwale, and was drawn in dripping.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) glared round him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) confusedly. <div class="bookquote">``I understand not that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), a
little peevishly; puzzled, and therefore, it would seem, discontented.
At which, finding he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was by some strange accident not slain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) doublet
being perforated, instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) body, they began to laugh again louder
than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are ye cackling at?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the spark, <div class="bookquote">``I desire to know
how `tis that one moment a gentleman is out yonder a pricking of African
beef, and the next moment--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard's lady. <div class="bookquote">``Disporting in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) native stream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) not, a soul of ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pietro Vanucci/Vanucci</b></font>)</div>cried Vanucci. <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) find out `s own
riddle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Confound ye all. I might puzzle my brains till doomsday, I should ne’er
find it out. Also, where is my sword?

<p/>Gerard's lady. <div class="bookquote">``Ask Tiber! Your best way, signor, will be to do it over
again; and, in a word, keep pricking of Afric's beef, till your mind
receives light. So shall you comprehend the matter by degrees, as
lawyers mount heaven, and buffaloes Tiber.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a chevalier</b></font>)</div><p/>Here a chevalier remarked that the last speaker transcended the sons of
Adam as much in wit as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did the daughters of Eve in beauty.

<p/>At which, and indeed at all their compliments, the conduct of Pietro
Vanucci was peculiar. That signor had left off staring, and gaping
bewildered; and now sat coiled up snake-like, on each, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) mouth
muffled, and two bright eyes fixed on the' lady, and twinkling and
scintillating most comically.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) did not appear to interest or amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in return. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glorious eyes
and eyelashes swept him (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) calmly at times, but scarce distinguished him (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>)
from the benches and things.

<p/>Presently the unanimity of the party suffered a momentary check.

<p/>Mortified by the attention the cavaliers paid to Gerard's companion, the
ladies began to pick her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to pieces sotto voce, and audibly.

<p/>The lovely girl then showed that, if rich in beauty, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was poor in
feminine tact. Instead of revenging herself like a true woman through
the men, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) permitted herself to overhear, and openly retaliate on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
detractors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is not one of you that wears Nature's colours,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Look
here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pointed rudely in one's face. <div class="bookquote">``This is the beauty that is
to be bought in every shop. Here is cerussa, here is stibium, and
here purpurissum. Oh, I know the articles bless you, I use them every
day--but not on my face, no thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pietro Vanucci/Vanucci</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Vanucci's eyes twinkled themselves nearly out of sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, your lips are coloured, and the very veins in your forehead: not a
charm but would come off with a wet towel. And look at your great coarse
black hair like a horse's tail, drugged and stained to look like tow.
And then your bodies are as false as your heads and your cheeks, and
your hearts I trow. Look at your padded bosoms, and your wooden heeled
chopines to raise your little stunted limbs up and deceive the world.
Skinny dwarfs ye are, cushioned and stultified into great fat giants.
Aha, mesdames, well is it said of you, grande--di legni: grosse--di
straci: rosse--di bettito: bianche--di calcina.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This drew out a rejoinder. <div class="bookquote">``Avaunt, vulgar toad, telling the men
everything. Your coarse, ruddy cheeks are your own, and your little
handful of African hair. But who is padded more? Why, you are shaped
like a fire-shovel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye lie, malapert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the well-educated young person! Where didst pick her (<font color='blue'><b>giants</b></font>) up, Ser
Gerard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold thy peace, Marcia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, awakened by the raised trebles
from a gloomy reverie. <div class="bookquote">``Be not so insolent! The grave shall close over
thy beauty as it hath over fairer than thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They began,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marcia</b></font>)</div>said Marcia petulantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then be thou the first to leave off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At thy request, my friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marcia</b></font>) then whispered Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``It was only to
make you laugh; you are distraught, you are sad. Judge whether I care
for the quips of these little fools, or the admiration of these big
fools. Dear Signor Gerard, would I were what they take me for? You
should not be so sad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard sighed deeply; and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head. But touched by the earnest
young tones, caressed the jet black locks, much as one strokes the head
of an affectionate dog.

<p/>At this moment a galley drifting slowly down stream got entangled for an
instant in their ropes: for, the river turning suddenly, they had shot
out into the stream; and this galley came between them and the bank. In
it a lady of great beauty was seated under a canopy with gallants and
dependents standing behind her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>Gerard looked up at the interruption. It was the Princess Claelia.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) coloured and withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand from Marcia's head.

<p/>Marcia was all admiration. <div class="bookquote">``Aha! ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``here is a rival an
ye will. Those cheeks were coloured by Nature-like mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Peace, child! peace!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Make not too free with the great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heard me not. Oh, Ser Gerard, what a lovely creature!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the females</b></font>)</div><p/>Two of the females had been for some time past putting their heads
together and casting glances at Marcia.

<p/>One of them now addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Signorina, do you love almonds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>The speaker had a lapful of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I love them; when I can get them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marcia</b></font>)</div>said Marcia pettishly, and
eyeing the fruit with ill-concealed desire; <div class="bookquote">``but yours is not the hand
to give me any, I trow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marcia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are much mistook,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other. <div class="bookquote">``Here, catch!''  (<font color='red'><b>a handful</b></font>)</div>And suddenly
threw a double handful into Marcia's lap.

<p/>Marcia brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcia</b></font>) knees together by an irresistible instinct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha! you are caught, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcia</b></font>) of the nuts. ```Tis a man; or a
boy. A woman still parteth her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees to catch the nuts the surer in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
apron; but a man closeth his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for fear they should all between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hose.
Confess, now, didst never wear fardingale ere to-day?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me another handful, sweetheart, and I'll tell thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There! I said he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was too handsome for a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ser Gerard, they have found me out,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed the Epicaene, calmly
cracking an almond.

<p/>The libertines vowed it was impossible, and all glared at the goddess
like a battery. But Vanucci struck in, and reminded the gaping gazers
of a recent controversy, in which they had, with a unanimity not often
found among dunces, laughed Gerard and him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to scorn, for saying that men
were as beautiful as women in a true artist's eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are ye now? This is my boy Andrea. And you have all been down on
your knees to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Ha! ha! But oh, my little ladies, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lectured
you and flung your stibium, your cerussa, and your purpurissum back in
your faces, `tis then I was like to burst; a grinds my colours. Ha! ha!
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)! ho!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The little impostor! Duck him (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for, signors?''  (<font color='red'><b>Andrea</b></font>)</div>cried Andrea, in dismay, and lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rich
carnation.

<p/>But the females collected round him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and vowed nobody should harm a hair
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dear child! How well his (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) pretty little saucy ways become him (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what eyes and teeth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what eyebrows and hair!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what lashes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what a nose!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The sweetest little ear in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what health! Touch but his (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) cheek with a pin the blood should
squirt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would be so cruel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) is a rosebud washed in dew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And they revenged themselves for their beaux' admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrea</b></font>) by
lavishing all their tenderness on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>But one there was who was still among these butterflies, but no longer
of them. The sight of the Princess Claelia had torn open his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wound.

<p/>Scarce three months ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had declined the love of that peerless
creature; a love illicit and insane; but at least refined.

<p/>How much lower had he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fallen now.

<p/>How happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) must have been, when the blandishments of Claelia, that
might have melted an anchorite, could not tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) from the path of
loyalty!

<p/>Now what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had blushed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in such company. Yet
it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) daily company.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hung over the boat in moody silence.

<p/>And from that hour another phase of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) misery began; and grew upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>Some wretched fools try to drown care in drink.

<p/>The fumes of intoxication vanish; the inevitable care remains, and must
be faced at last--with an aching head, disordered stomach, and spirits
artificially depressed.

<p/>Gerard's conduct had been of a piece with these maniacs'. To survive
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) terrible blow he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) needed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) forces; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) virtue, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) health, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
habits of labour, and the calm sleep that is labour's satellite; above
all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) piety.

<p/>Yet all these balms to wounded hearts he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) flung away and trusted to moral
intoxication.

<p/>Its brief fumes fled; the bereaved heart lay still heavy as lead within
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bosom; but now the dark vulture Remorse sat upon it rending it.

<p/>Broken health; means wasted; innocence fled; Margaret parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) by
another gulf wider than the grave! The hot fit of despair passed away.

<p/>The cold fit of despair came on.

<p/>Then this miserable young man spurned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gay companions, and all the
world.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wandered alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drank wine alone to stupefy himself; and paralyze
a moment the dark foes to man that preyed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wandered
alone amidst the temples of old Rome, and lay stony eyed, woebegone,
among their ruins, worse wrecked than they.

<p/>Last of all came the climax, to which solitude, that gloomy yet
fascinating foe of minds diseased, pushes the hopeless.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) wandered alone at night by dark streams, and eyed them, and
eyed them, with decreasing repugnance. There glided peace; perhaps
annihilation.

<p/>What else was left him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>)?

<p/>These dark spells have been broken by kind words, by loving and cheerful
voices.

<p/>The humblest friend the afflicted one possesses may speak, or look, or
smile, a sunbeam between him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and that worst madness Gerard now brooded.

<p/>Where was Teresa? Where his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hearty, kind old landlady?

<p/>They would see with their homely but swift intelligence; they would see
and save.

<p/>No; they knew not where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was, or whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was gliding.

<p/>And is there no mortal eye upon the poor wretch, and the dark road he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is
going?

<p/>Yes; one eye there is upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) every movement; following
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) abroad; tracking him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) home.

<p/>And that eye is the eye of an enemy.

<p/>An enemy to the death.



<p/>CHAPTER LXIV

<p/>In an apartment richly furnished, the floor covered with striped and
spotted skins of animals, a lady sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms extended before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands half clenched. The agitation of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face corresponded with
this attitude; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was pale and red by turns; and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) foot restless.

<p/>Presently the curtain was drawn by a domestic.

<p/>The lady's brow flushed.

<p/>The maid said, in an awe-struck whisper: <div class="bookquote">``Altezza, the man is here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The maid</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady bade her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) admit him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and snatched up a little black mask and put
it on; and in a moment her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) colour was gone, and the contrast between her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
black mask and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) marble cheeks was strange and fearful.

<p/>A man entered bowing and scraping. It was such a figure as crowds seem
made of; short hair, roundish head, plain, but decent clothes; features
neither comely not forbidding. Nothing to remark in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but a singularly
restless eye.

<p/>After a profusion of bows he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood opposite the lady, and awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have told you for what you are wanted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Signora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did those who spoke to you agree as to what you are to receive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Signora. `Tis the full price; and purchases the greater vendetta:
unless of your benevolence you choose to content yourself with the
lesser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand you not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah; this is the Signora's first. The lesser vendetta, lady, is the
death of the body only. We watch our man come out of a church; or take
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in an innocent hour; and so deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). In the greater vendetta
we watch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and catch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hot from some unrepented sin, and so slay
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body. But this vendetta is not so run upon now
as it was a few years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Man, silence me his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) tongue, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) treasonable heart beat no more.
But his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) soul I have no feud with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it, signora. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) who spoke to me knew not the man, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name,
nor his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) abode. From whom shall I learn these?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this the man</b></font>)</div><p/>At this the man, with the first symptoms of anxiety he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had shown,
entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to be cautious, and particular, in this part of the
business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fear me not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Listen. It is a young man, tall of stature,
and auburn hair, and dark blue eyes, and an honest face, would deceive
a saint. He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) lives in the Via Claudia, at the corner house; the glover's.
In that house there lodge but three males: he (<font color='blue'><b>glover</b></font>); and a painter short of
stature and dark visaged, and a young, slim boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that hath betrayed
me is a stranger, fair, and taller than thou art.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The bravo listened with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">``It is enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay, Signora; haunteth he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) any secret place where I may deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My spy doth report me he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hath of late frequented the banks of Tiber
after dusk; doubtless to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) light o' love, who calls me her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) rival;
even there slay him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)! and let my rival come and find him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); the smooth,
heartless, insolent traitor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be calm, signora. He (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) will betray no more ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know not that. He (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) weareth a sword, and can use it. He (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) is young and
resolute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither will avail him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are ye so sure of your hand? What are your weapons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The bravo showed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a steel gauntlet. <div class="bookquote">``We strike with such force
we need must guard our hand. This is our mallet.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then undid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
doublet, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a glimpse of a coat of mail beneath, and finally
laid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glittering stiletto on the table with a flourish.

<p/>The lady shuddered at first, but presently took it up in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) white hand
and tried its point against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beware, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the bravo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, is it poisoned?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saints forbid! We steal no lives. We take them with steel point, not
drugs. But `tis newly ground, and I feared for the Signora's white
skin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) skin is as white as mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), with a sudden gleam of pity.
It lasted but a moment. <div class="bookquote">``But his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) heart is black as soot. Say, do I not
well to remove a traitor that slanders me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The signora will settle that with her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) confessor. I am but a tool in
noble hands; like my stiletto.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The princess</b></font>)</div><p/>The princess appeared not to hear the speaker. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, how I could have
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>); to the death; as now I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>). Fool! he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) will learn to
trifle with princes; to spurn them and fawn on them, and prefer the
scum of the town to them, and make them a by-word.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) looked up. <div class="bookquote">``Why
loiter'st thou here? haste thee, revenge me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is customary to pay half the price beforehand, Signora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah I forgot; thy revenge is bought. Here is more than half,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
pushed a bag across the table to him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``When the blow is struck, come for
the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will soon see me again, signora.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) retired bowing and scraping.

<p/>The princess, burning with jealousy, mortified pride, and dread of
exposure -LRB-for till she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) knew Gerard no public stain had fallen on her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)-RRB-,
sat where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), masked, with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) arms straight out before her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>),
and the nails of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) clenched hand nipping the table.

<p/>So sat the fabled sphynx: so sits a tigress.

<p/>Yet there crept a chill upon her (<font color='blue'><b>tigress</b></font>) now that the assassin was gone. And
moody misgivings heaved within her (<font color='blue'><b>tigress</b></font>), precursors of vain remorse. Gerard
and Margaret were before their age. This was your true mediaeval.
Proud, amorous, vindictive, generous, foolish, cunning, impulsive,
unprincipled: and ignorant as dirt.

<p/>Power is the curse of such a creature.

<p/>Forced to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own crimes, the weakness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) nerves would have
balanced the violence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) passions, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bark been worse than her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
bite. But power gives a feeble, furious woman, male instruments. And the
effect is as terrible as the combination is unnatural.

<p/>In this instance it whetted an assassin's dagger for a poor forlorn
wretch just meditating suicide.



<p/>CHAPTER LXV

<p/>It happened, two days after the scene I have endeavoured to describe,
that Gerard, wandering through one of the meanest streets in Rome, was
overtaken by a thunderstorm, and entered a low hostelry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) called for
wine, and the rain continuing, soon drank himself into a half stupid
condition, and dozed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands upon the
table.

<p/>In course of time the room began to fill and the noise of the rude
guests to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>Then it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) became conscious of two figures near him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) conversing in a
low voice.

<p/>One was a pardoner. The other by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dress, clean but modest, might have
passed for a decent tradesman; but the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had slouched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hat over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) brows, so as to hide all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face except his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) beard, showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was
one of those who shun the eye of honest men, and of the law. The pair
were driving a bargain in the sin market. And by an arrangement
not uncommon at that date, the crime to be forgiven was yet to be
committed--under the celestial contract.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) of the slouched hat was complaining of the price pardons had reached.
<div class="bookquote">``If they go up any higher we poor fellows shall be shut out of heaven
altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The pardoner denied the charge flatly. <div class="bookquote">``Indulgences were never cheaper
to good husbandmen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The other inquired, <div class="bookquote">``Who were they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, such as sin by the market, like reasonable creatures. But if you
will be so perverse as go and pick out a crime the Pope hath set his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)
face against, blame yourself, not me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the scum</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, to prove that crime of one sort or another was within the means of
all but the very scum of society, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) read out the scale from a written
parchment.

<p/>It was a curious list; but not one that could be printed in this book.
And to mutilate it would be to misrepresent it. It is to be found in
any great library. Suffice it to say that murder of a layman was much
cheaper than many crimes my lay readers would deem light by comparison.

<p/>This told; and by a little trifling concession on each side, the bargain
was closed, the money handed over, and the aspirant to heaven's favour
forgiven beforehand for removing one layman. The price for disposing of
a clerk bore no proportion.

<p/>The word assassination was never once uttered by either merchant.

<p/>All this buzzed in Gerard's ear. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) never lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head from the
table; only listened stupidly.

<p/>However, when the parties rose and separated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) half raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head,
and eyed with a scowl the retiring figure of the purchaser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Margaret was alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>muttered he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'd take thee by the throat and
throttle thee, thou cowardly stabber. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is dead; dead; dead. Die
all the world; `tis nought to me: so that I die among the first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) got home there was a man in a slouched hat walking briskly to
and fro on the opposite side of the way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there is that cur again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>thought Gerard.

<p/>But in this state of mind, the circumstance made no impression whatever
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER LXVI

<p/>Two nights after this Pietro Vanucci and Andrea sat waiting supper for
Gerard.

<p/>The former grew peevish. It was past nine o’clock. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sent
Andrea to Gerard's room on the desperate chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) having come in
unobserved. Andrea shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shoulders and went.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) returned without Gerard, but with a slip of paper. Andrea could not
read, as scholars in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) day and charity boys in ours understand the
art; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had a quick eye, and had learned how the words Pietro
Vanucci looked on paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is for you, I trow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>), proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) intelligence.

<p/>Pietro snatched it, and read it to Andrea, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) satirical comments.

<p/>```Dear Pietro, dear Andrea, life is too great a burden.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So `tis, my lad,' but that is no reason for being abroad at
supper-time. Supper is not a burden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Wear my habits!'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Said the poplar to the juniper bush.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Andrea</b></font>)</div><p/>```And thou, Andrea, mine amethyst ring; and me in both your hearts a
month or two.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Andrea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```For my body, ere this ye read, it will lie in Tiber. Trouble not to
look for it. `Tis not worth the pains. Oh unhappy day that it was born
oh happy night that rids me of it.

<p/>```Adieu! adieu!

<p/>```The broken-hearted Gerard.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is a sorry jest of the peevish rogue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pietro/Signor Pietro</b></font>)</div>said Pietro. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) pale
cheek and chattering teeth belied his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) words. Andrea filled the house
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) cries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, miserable day! O, calamity of calamities! Gerard, my friend, my
sweet patron! Help! help! He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is killing himself! Oh, good people, help
me save him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And after alarming all the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) ran into the street,
bareheaded, imploring all good Christians to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) save his (<font color='blue'><b>Pietro</b></font>) friend.

<p/>A number of persons soon collected.

<p/>But poor Andrea could not animate their sluggishness. Go down to the
river? No. It was not their business. What part of the river? It was a
wild goose chase.

<p/>It was not lucky to go down to the river after sunset. Too many ghosts
walked those banks all night.

<p/>A lackey, however, who had been standing some time opposite the house,
said he (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>) would go with Andrea; and this turned three or four of the
younger ones.

<p/>The little band took the way to the river.

<p/>The lackey questioned Andrea.

<p/>Andrea, sobbing, told him (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>) about the letter, and Gerard's moody ways of
late.

<p/>That lackey was a spy of the Princess Claelia.

<p/>Their Italian tongues went fast till they neared the Tiber.

<p/>But the moment they felt the air from the river, and the smell of the
stream in the calm spring night, they were dead silent.

<p/>The moon shone calm and clear in a cloudless sky. Their feet sounded
loud and ominous. Their tongues were hushed.

<p/>Presently hurrying round a corner they met a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped irresolute
at sight of them.

<p/>The man was bareheaded, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dripping hair glistened in the
moonlight; and at the next step they saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes were drenched with
water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>cried one of the young men, unacquainted with Gerard's
face and figure.

<p/>The stranger turned instantly and fled.

<p/>They ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) might and main, Andrea leading, and the princess's
lackey next.

<p/>Andrea gained on him (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>); but in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>) twisted up a narrow alley.
Andrea shot by, unable to check himself; and the pursuers soon found
themselves in a labyrinth in which it was vain to pursue a quickfooted
fugitive who knew every inch of it, and could now only be followed by
the ear.

<p/>They returned to their companions, and found them standing on the spot
where the man had stood, and utterly confounded. For Pietro had assured
them that the fugitive had neither the features nor the stature of
Gerard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are ye verily sure?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said they. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had been in the river. Why, in the
saints' names, fled he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) at our approach?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pietro Vanucci/Vanucci</b></font>)</div><p/>Then said Vanucci, <div class="bookquote">``Friends, methinks this has nought to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) we
seek. What shall we do, Andrea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pietro Vanucci/Vanucci</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the lackey put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) word. <div class="bookquote">``Let us track him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to the water's side,
to make sure. See, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hath come dripping all the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>This advice was approved, and with very little difficulty they tracked
the man's course.

<p/>But soon they encountered a new enigma.

<p/>They had gone scarcely fifty yards ere the drops turned away from the
river, and took them to the gate of a large gloomy building. It was a
monastery.

<p/>They stood irresolute before it, and gazed at the dark pile.

<p/>It seemed to them to hide some horrible mystery.

<p/>But presently Andrea gave a shout. <div class="bookquote">``Here be the drops again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``And this road leadeth to the river.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They resumed the chase; and soon it became clear the drops were now
leading them home. The track became wetter and wetter, and took them
to the Tiber's edge. And there on the bank a bucketful appeared to have
been discharged from the stream.

<p/>At first they shouted, and thought they had made a discovery: but
reflection showed them it amounted to nothing. Certainly a man had been
in the water, and had got out of it in safety; but that man was not
Gerard. One said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knew a fisherman hard by that had nets and drags.
They found the fisherman and paid him (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>) liberally to sink nets in the
river below the place, and to drag it above and below; and promised him (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>)
gold should he (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>) find the body. Then they ran vainly up and down the river
which flowed so calm and voiceless, holding this and a thousand more
strange secrets. Suddenly Andrea, with a cry of hope, ran back to the
house.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>) returned in less than half an hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>) groaned, and wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the hour?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lackey</b></font>)</div>asked the lackey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four hours past midnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My pretty lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lackey</b></font>)</div>said the lackey solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``say a mass for thy friend's
soul: for he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is not among living men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lackey</b></font>)</div><p/>The morning broke. Worn out with fatigue, Andrea and Pietro went home,
heart sick.

<p/>The days rolled on, mute as the Tiber as to Gerard's fate.



<p/>CHAPTER LXVII

<p/>It would indeed have been strange if with such barren data as they
possessed, those men could have read the handwriting on the river's
bank.

<p/>For there on that spot an event had just occurred, which, take it
altogether, was perhaps without a parallel in the history of mankind,
and may remain so to the end of time.

<p/>But it shall be told in a very few words, partly by me, partly by an
actor in the scene.

<p/>Gerard, then, after writing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) brief adieu to Pietro and Andrea, had
stolen down to the river at nightfall.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) measures with a dogged resolution not uncommon in those
who are bent on self-destruction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pockets with all the
silver and copper he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) possessed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) might sink the surer; and so
provided, hurried to a part of the stream that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had seen was little
frequented.

<p/>There are some, especially women, who look about to make sure there is
somebody at hand.

<p/>But this resolute wretch looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to make sure there was nobody.

<p/>And to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) annoyance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) observed a single figure leaning against
the corner of an alley. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) affected to stroll carelessly away; but
returned to the spot.

<p/>Lo! the same figure emerged from a side street and loitered about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) be watching me? Can he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) know what I am here for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>thought Gerard.
<div class="bookquote">``Impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went briskly off, walked along a street or two, made a detour and
came back.

<p/>The man had vanished. But lo! on Gerard looking all round, to make sure,
there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was a few yards behind, apparently fastening his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shoe.

<p/>Gerard saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was watched, and at this moment observed in the moonlight
a steel gauntlet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sentinel's hand.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knew it was an assassin.

<p/>Strange to say, it never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was the life aimed at.
To be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was not aware he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had an enemy in the world.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned and walked up to the bravo. <div class="bookquote">``My good friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eagerly,
<div class="bookquote">``sell me thine arm! a single stroke! See, here is all I have;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) money into the bravo's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, prithee! prithee! do one good deed, and rid me of my hateful life!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and even while speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) undid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) doublet and bared his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bosom.

<p/>The man stared in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do ye hesitate?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>shrieked Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``Have ye no bowels? Is it so much
pains to lift your arm and fall it? Is it because I am poor, and can't
give ye gold? Useless wretch, canst only strike a man behind; not look
one in the face. There, then, do but turn thy head and hold thy tongue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And with a snarl of contempt he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ran from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and flung himself into the
water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At the heavy plunge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) body in the stream the bravo seemed to
recover from a stupor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ran to the bank, and with a strange cry the
assassin plunged in after the self-destroyer.

<p/>What followed will be related by the assassin.



<p/>CHAPTER LXVIII

<p/>A woman has her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own troubles, as a man has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And we male writers
seldom do more than indicate the griefs of the other sex. The
intelligence of the female reader must come to our aid, and fill up our
cold outlines. So have I indicated, rather than described, what Margaret
Brandt went through up to that eventful day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entered Eli's
house an enemy, read her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sweetheart's letter, and remained a friend.

<p/>And now a woman's greatest trial drew near, and Gerard far away.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) availed herself but little of Eli's sudden favour; for this reserve
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had always a plausible reason ready; and never hinted at the true
one, which was this; there were two men in that house at sight of
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shuddered with instinctive antipathy and dread. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had read
wickedness and hatred in their faces, and mysterious signals of secret
intelligence. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) preferred to receive Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter at
home. The former went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) every day, and was wrapped up in the
expected event.

<p/>Catherine was one of those females whose office is to multiply, and rear
the multiplied: who, when at last they consent to leave off pelting
one out of every room in the house with babies, hover about the fair
scourges that are still in full swing, and do so cluck, they seem to
multiply by proxy. It was in this spirit she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entreated Eli to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
stay at Rotterdam, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) went back to Tergou.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The poor lass hath not a soul about her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>), that knows anything about
anything. What avail a pair o' soldiers? Why, that sort o' cattle should
be putten out o' doors the first, at such an a time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Need I say that this was a great comfort to Margaret.

<p/>Poor soul, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was full of anxiety as the time drew near.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) should die; and Gerard away.

<p/>But things balance themselves. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) poverty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father's
helplessness, which had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) such a struggle, stood her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in good
stead now.

<p/>Adversity's iron hand had forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to battle the lassitude that
overpowers the rich of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sex, and to be for ever on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) feet, working.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) kept this up to the last by Catherine's advice.

<p/>And so it was, that one fine evening, just at sunset, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lay weak
as water, but safe; with a little face by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) side, and the heaven of
maternity opening on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why dost weep, sweetheart? All of a sudden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not here to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, lass, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be here ere `tis weaned. Meantime God hath
been as good to thee as to e'er a woman born; and do but bethink thee
it might have been a girl; didn't my very own Kate threaten me with one;
and here we have got the bonniest boy in Holland, and a rare heavy one,
the saints be praised for't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, mother, I am but a sorry, ungrateful wretch to weep. If only Gerard
were here to see it. `Tis strange; I bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) well enow to be away from
me in my sorrow; but oh, it does seem so hard he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should not share my
joy. Prithee, prithee, come to me, Gerard! dear, dear Gerard!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feeble arms.

<p/>Catherine hustled about, but avoided Margaret's eyes; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not
restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own tears at hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own absent child thus earnestly
addressed.

<p/>Presently, turning round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found Margaret looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with a
singular expression. <div class="bookquote">``Heard you nought?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my lamb. What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did cry on Gerard, but now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, sure I heard that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) answered me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tush, girl: say not that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, as sure as I lie here, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) boy by my side, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) voice came
back to me, `Margaret!' So. Yet methought `twas not his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) happy voice. But
that might be the distance. All voices go off sad like at a distance.
Why art not happy, sweetheart? and I so happy this night? Mother, I seem
never to have felt a pain or known a care.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sweet eyes turned
and gloated on the little face in silence.

<p/>That very night Gerard flung himself into the Tiber. And that very
hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) speak her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) name, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried aloud in death's jaws and
despair's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Account for it those who can. I cannot.



<p/>CHAPTER LXIX

<p/>In the guest chamber of a Dominican convent lay a single stranger,
exhausted by successive and violent fits of nausea, which had at last
subsided, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) almost as weak as Margaret lay that night in
Holland.

<p/>A huge wood fire burned on the hearth, and beside it hung the patient's
clothes.

<p/>A gigantic friar sat by his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) bedside, reading pious collects aloud from
his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) breviary.

<p/>The patient at times eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), and seemed to listen: at others closed
his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) eyes and moaned.

<p/>The monk kneeled down with his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) face touching the ground and prayed for
him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>); then rose and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) farewell. <div class="bookquote">``Day breaks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I must
prepare for matins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Father Jerome, before you go, how came I hither?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the hand of Heaven. You flung away God's gift. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bestowed it on you
again. Think on it! Hast tried the world and found its gall. Now try the
Church! The Church is peace. Pax vobiscum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) was gone. Gerard lay back, meditating and wondering, till weak and
wearied he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) fell into a doze.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) awoke again he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) found a new nurse seated beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). It was a
layman, with an eye as small and restless as Friar Jerome's was calm and
majestic.

<p/>The man inquired earnestly how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very, very weak. Where have I seen you before, messer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None the worse for my gauntlet?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired the other, with considerable
anxiety; <div class="bookquote">``I was fain to strike you withal, or both you and I should be
at the bottom of Tiber.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What, `twas you saved me? How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, signor, I was by the banks of Tiber on-on an errand, no matter
what. You came to me and begged hard for a dagger stroke. But ere I
could oblige you, ay, even as you spoke to me, I knew you for the signor
that saved my wife and child upon the sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Teresa's husband. And an assassin?!!?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At your service. Well, Ser Gerard, the next thing was, you flung
yourself into Tiber, and bade me hold aloof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Had it been any but you, believe me I had obeyed you, and not wagged a
finger. Men are my foes. They may all hang on one rope, or drown in one
river for me. But when thou, sinking in Tiber, didst cry `Margaret!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``My heart it cried `Teresa!' How could I go home and look her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) in the
face, did I let thee die, and by the very death thou savedst her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) from?
So in I went; and luckily for us both I swim like a duck. You, seeing
me near, and being bent on destruction, tried to grip me, and so end us
both. But I swam round thee, and -LRB-receive my excuses-RRB- so buffeted thee
on the nape of the neck with my steel glove; that thou lost sense, and
I with much ado, the stream being strong, did draw thy body to land, but
insensible and full of water. Then I took thee on my back and made for
my own home. `Teresa will nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>), and be pleased with me,' thought I.
But hard by this monastery, a holy friar, the biggest e'er I saw, met us
and asked the matter. So I told him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) looked hard at thee. `I know
the face,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>). `'Tis one Gerard, a fair youth from Holland.'
`The same,' quo' I. Then said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reverence, `He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hath friends among our
brethren. Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with us! Charity, it is our office.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) told me they of the convent had better means to tend thee than
I had. And that was true enow. So I just bargained to be let in to see
thee once a day, and here thou art.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>And the miscreant cast a strange look of affection and interest upon
Gerard.

<p/>Gerard did not respond to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) felt as if a snake were in the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, thou wouldst sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the miscreant eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``I go.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
retired on tip-toe with a promise to come every day.

<p/>Gerard lay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes closed: not asleep, but deeply pondering.

<p/>Saved from death, by an assassin

<p/>Was not this the finger of Heaven?

<p/>Of that Heaven he (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) had insulted, cursed, and defied.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) shuddered at his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) blasphemies. He (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) tried to pray.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) could utter prayers. But he (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) could not pray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am doomed eternally,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``doomed, doomed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The organ of the convent church burst on his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) ear in rich and solemn
harmony.

<p/>Then rose the voices of the choir chanting a full service.

<p/>Among them was one that seemed to hover above the others, and tower
towards heaven; a sweet boy's voice, full, pure, angelic.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes and listened. The days of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own boyhood flowed back
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in those sweet, pious harmonies. No earthly dross there, no
foul, fierce passions, rending and corrupting the soul.

<p/>Peace, peace; sweet, balmy peace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sighed, <div class="bookquote">``the Church is peace of mind. Till I left her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bosom I
ne’er knew sorrow, nor sin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And the poor torn, worn creature wept.

<p/>And even as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wept, there beamed on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the sweet and reverend face of
one he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had never thought to see again. It was the face of Father Anselm.

<p/>The good father had only reached the convent the night before last.
Gerard recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in a moment, and cried to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Father Anselm,
you cured my wounded body in Juliers: now cure my hurt soul in Rome!
Alas, you cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Anselm sat down by the bedside, and putting a gentle hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head,
first calmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with a soothing word or two.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had learned how Gerard came there-RRB- spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) kindly
but solemnly, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) crime, and urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to repentance,
and gratitude to that Divine Power which had thwarted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will to save
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``first purge thy bosom of its load.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``in Juliers I could; then I was innocent but
now, impious monster that I am, I dare not confess to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, my son? Thinkest thou I have not sinned against Heaven in my
time, and deeply? oh, how deeply! Come, poor laden soul, pour forth thy
grief, pour forth thy faults, hold back nought! Lie not oppressed and
crushed by hidden sins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>And soon Gerard was at Father Anselm's knees confessing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) every sin
with sighs and groans of penitence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thy sins are great,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anselm</b></font>)</div>said Anselm. <div class="bookquote">``Thy temptation also was great,
terribly great. I must consult our good prior.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anselm</b></font>)</div><p/>The good Anselm kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) brow, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), to consult the superior
as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) penance.

<p/>And lo! Gerard could pray now.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) prayed with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart.

<p/>The phase, through which this remarkable mind now passed, may be summed
in a word--Penitence.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned with terror and aversion from the world, and begged
passionately to remain in the convent. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), convent nurtured, it was
like a bird returning wounded, wearied, to its gentle nest.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) novitiate in prayer, and mortification, and pious reading
and meditation.


<p/>The Princess Claelia's spy went home and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) that Gerard was
certainly dead, the manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) death unknown at present.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) seemed literally stunned. When, after a long time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) found breath
to speak at all, it was to bemoan her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) lot, cursed with such ready tools.
<div class="bookquote">``So soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) sighed; <div class="bookquote">``see how swift these monsters are to do ill
deeds. They come to us in our hot blood, and first tempt us with their
venal daggers, then enact the mortal deeds we ne’er had thought on but
for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ere many hours had passed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) pity for Gerard and hatred of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
murderer had risen to fever heat; which with this fool was blood heat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor soul! I cannot call thee back to life. But he (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) shall never live
that traitorously slew thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) put armed men in ambush, and kept them on guard all day, ready,
when Lodovico should come for his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) money, to fall on him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) in a certain
antechamber and hack him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) to pieces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strike at his (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) head,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) weareth a privy coat of mail;
and if he (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) goes hence alive your own heads shall answer it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) sat weeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) victim, and pulling the strings of machines
to shed the blood of a second for having been her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) machine to kill the
first.



<p/>CHAPTER LXX

<p/>One of the novice Gerard's self-imposed penances was to receive Lodovico
kindly, feeling secretly as to a slimy serpent.

<p/>Never was self-denial better bestowed; and like most rational penances,
it soon became no penance at all. At first the pride and complacency,
with which the assassin gazed on the one life he (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) had saved, was perhaps
as ludicrous as pathetic; but it is a great thing to open a good door in
a heart. One good thing follows another through the aperture. Finding it
so sweet to save life, the miscreant went on to be averse to taking
it; and from that to remorse; and from remorse to something very like
penitence. And here Teresa cooperated by threatening, not for the first
time, to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) unless he (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) would consent to lead an honest life. The
good fathers of the convent lent their aid, and Lodovico and Teresa
were sent by sea to Leghorn, where Teresa had friends, and the assassin
settled down and became a porter.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) found it miserably dull work at first; and said so.

<p/>But methinks this dull life of plodding labour was better for him (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>), than
the brief excitement of being hewn in pieces by the Princess Claelia's
myrmidons. His (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) exile saved the unconscious penitent from that fate; and
the princess, balked of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) revenge, took to brooding, and fell into a
profound melancholy; dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) confessor, and took a new one with
a great reputation for piety, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) confided what she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
griefs. The new confessor was no other than Fra Jerome. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) could not
have fallen into better hands.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) grimly out. Then took her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) and shook the delusions out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) as roughly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had been a kitchen-maid. For, to do this hard
monk justice, on the path of duty he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) feared the anger of princes as
little as he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) did the sea. He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) in a few words, all thunder and
lightning, that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was the criminal of criminals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou art the devil, that with thy money hath tempted one man to slay
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellow, and then, blinded with self-love, instead of blaming and
punishing thyself, art thirsting for more blood of guilty men, but not
so guilty as thou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) resisted, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was not used to be taken to task
by her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) confessors. But he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), and so threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) with
the Church's curse here and hereafter, and so tore the scales off her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
eyes, and thundered at her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), and crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) sank down and
grovelled with remorse and terror at the feet of the gigantic Boanerges.

<p/>``Oh, holy father, have pity on a poor weak woman, and help me save my
guilty soul. I was benighted for want of ghostly counsel like thine,
good father. I waken as from a dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doff thy jewels,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fra Jerome</b></font>)</div>said Fra Jerome sternly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will. I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doff thy silk and velvet; and in humbler garb than wears thy meanest
servant, wend thou instant to Loretto.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess faintly.

<p/>``No shoes; but a bare sandal.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wash the feet of pilgrims both going and coming; and to such of them as
be holy friars tell thy sin, and abide their admonition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, holy father, let me wear my mask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mercy! Bethink thee! My features are known through Italy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay. Beauty is a curse to most of ye. Well, thou mayst mask thine eyes;
no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On this concession she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) hand, and was about to kiss it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>)
snatched it rudely from her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What would ye do? That hand handled the eucharist but an hour agone: is
it fit for such as thou to touch it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, no. But oh, go not without giving your penitent daughter your
blessing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Time enow to ask it when you come back from Loretto.''


 (<font color='red'><b>the actors</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus that marvellous occurrence by Tiber's banks left its mark on all
the actors, as prodigies are said to do. The assassin, softened by
saving the life he (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) was paid to take, turned from the stiletto to the
porter's knot. The princess went barefoot to Loretto, weeping her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) crime
and washing the feet of base-born men.

<p/>And Gerard, carried from the Tiber into that convent a suicide, now
passed for a young saint within its walls.

<p/>Loving but experienced eyes were on him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>).

<p/>Upon a shorter probation than usual he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) was admitted to priest's orders.

<p/>And soon after took the monastic vows, and became a friar of St.
Dominic.

<p/>Dying to the world, the monk parted with the very name by which he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) had
lived in it, and so broke the last link of association with earthly
feelings.

<p/>Here Gerard ended, and Brother Clement began.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXI

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As is the race of leaves so is that of men.''  (<font color='red'><b>a man man</b></font>)</div>And a great man budded
unnoticed in a tailor's house at Rotterdam this year, and a large man
dropped to earth with great eclat.

<p/>Philip, Duke of Burgundy, Earl of Holland, etc., etc., lay sick at
Bruges. Now paupers got sick and got well as Nature pleased; but woe
betided the rich in an age when, for one Mr. Malady killed three fell by
Dr. Remedy.

<p/>The Duke's complaint, nameless then, is now diphtheria. It is, and was,
a very weakening malady, and the Duke was old; so altogether Dr. Remedy
bled him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/>The Duke turned very cold: wonderful!

<p/>Then Dr. Remedy had recourse to the arcana of science.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho! This is grave. Flay me an ape incontinent, and clap him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) to the
Duke's breast!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Officers</b></font>)</div><p/>Officers of state ran septemvious, seeking an ape, to counteract the
bloodthirsty tomfoolery of the human species.

<p/>Perdition! The duke was out of apes. There were buffaloes, lizards,
Turks, leopards; any unreasonable beast but the right one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there used to be an ape about,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one. <div class="bookquote">``If I stand here I saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So there used; but the mastiff had mangled the sprightly creature for
stealing his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) supper; and so fulfilled the human precept, <div class="bookquote">``Soyez de votre
siecle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div><p/>In this emergency the seneschal cast his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) despairing eyes around; and not
in vain. A hopeful light shot into them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>), sotto voce. <div class="bookquote">``Surely this will serve: `tis
altogether apelike, doublet and hose apart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chancellor</b></font>)</div>said the chancellor peevishly, <div class="bookquote">``the Princess Marie would hang us.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) doteth on this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chancellor</b></font>)</div><p/>Now this was our friend Giles, strutting, all unconscious, in cloth of
gold.

<p/>Then Dr. Remedy grew impatient, and bade flay a dog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A dog is next best to an ape; only it must be a dog all of one colour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a dog</b></font>)</div><p/>So they flayed a liver-coloured dog, and clapped it, yet palpitating, to
their sovereign's breast and he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) died.

<p/>Philip the Good, thus scientifically disposed of, left thirty-one
children: of whom one, somehow or another, was legitimate; and reigned
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stead.

<p/>The good duke provided for nineteen out of the other thirty; the rest
shifted for themselves.

<p/>According to the Flemish chronicle the deceased prince was descended
from the kings of Troy through Thierry of Aquitaine, and Chilperic,
Pharamond, etc., the old kings of Franconia.

<p/>But this in reality was no distinction. Not a prince of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) day have
I been able to discover who did not come down from Troy. <div class="bookquote">``Priam''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was
mediaeval for <div class="bookquote">``Adam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div><p/>The good duke's, body was carried into Burgundy, and laid in a noble
mausoleum of black marble at Dijon.

<p/>Holland rang with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holland</b></font>) death; and little dreamed that anything as
famous was born in her (<font color='blue'><b>Flemish</b></font>) territory that year. That judgment has been long
reversed. Men gaze at the tailor's house, here the great birth of the
fifteenth century took place. In what house the good duke died <div class="bookquote">``no one
knows and no one cares,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>as the song says.

<p/>And why?

<p/>Dukes Philip the Good come and go, and leave mankind not a halfpenny
wiser, nor better, nor other than they found it.

<p/>But when, once in three hundred years, such a child is born to the world
as Margaret's son, lo! a human torch lighted by fire from heaven; and
<div class="bookquote">``FIAT LUX''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>thunder's from pole to pole.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXII

<p/>The Cloister

<p/>The Dominicans, or preaching friars, once the most powerful order in
Europe, were now on the wane; their rivals and bitter enemies, the
Franciscans, were overpowering them throughout Europe; even in England,
a rich and religious country, where under the name of the Black Friars,
they had once been paramount.

<p/>Therefore the sagacious men, who watched and directed the interests of
the order, were never so anxious to incorporate able and zealous sons
and send them forth to win back the world.

<p/>The zeal and accomplishments of Clement, especially his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) rare mastery of
language -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) spoke Latin, Italian, French, high and low Dutch-RRB-,
soon transpired, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was destined to travel and preach in England,
corresponding with the Roman centre.

<p/>But Jerome, who had the superior's ear, obstructed this design.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clement,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>), ``has the milk of the world still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) veins, its
feelings, its weaknesses let not his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) new-born zeal and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) humility
tempt us to forego our ancient wisdom. Try him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) first, and temper him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>),
lest one day we find ourselves leaning on a reed for a staff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well advised,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the prior. <div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) in hand thyself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Jerome, following the ancient wisdom, took Clement and tried him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>).

<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) to a field where the young men amused themselves
at the games of the day; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) knew this to be a haunt of Clement's late
friends.

<p/>And sure enough ere long Pietro Vanucci and Andrea passed by them, and
cast a careless glance on the two friars. They did not recognize their
dead friend in a shaven monk.

<p/>Clement gave a very little start, and then lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes and said a
paternoster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would ye not speak with them, brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>said Jerome, trying him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No brother: yet was it good for me to see them. They remind me of the
sins I can never repent enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>said Jerome, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) made a cold report in Clement's
favour.

<p/>Then Jerome took Clement to many death-beds. And then into noisome
dungeons; places where the darkness was appalling, and the stench
loathsome, pestilential; and men looking like wild beasts lay coiled
in rags and filth and despair. It tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) body hard; but the soul
collected all its powers to comfort such poor wretches there as were
not past comfort. And Clement shone in that trial. Jerome reported that
Clement's spirit was willing, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) flesh was weak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anselm</b></font>)</div>said Anselm; <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) flesh is weak, but his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spirit is willing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anselm</b></font>)</div><p/>But there was a greater trial in store.

<p/>I will describe it as it was seen by others.

<p/>One morning a principal street in Rome was crowded, and even the avenues
blocked up with heads. It was an execution. No common crime had been
done, and on no vulgar victim.

<p/>The governor of Rome had been found in his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) bed at daybreak, slaughtered.
His (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) hand, raised probably in self-defence, lay by his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) side severed at
the wrist; his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) throat was cut, and his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) temples bruised with some blunt
instrument. The murder had been traced to his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) servant, and was to be
expiated in kind this very morning.

<p/>Italian executions were not cruel in general. But this murder was
thought to call for exact and bloody retribution.

<p/>The criminal was brought to the house of the murdered man and fastened
for half an hour to its wall. After this foretaste of legal vengeance
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left hand was struck off, like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) victim's. A new-killed fowl was
cut open and fastened round the bleeding stump; with what view I really
don't know; but by the look of it, some mare's nest of the poor dear
doctors; and the murderer, thus mutilated and bandaged, was hurried to
the scaffold; and there a young friar was most earnest and affectionate
in praying with him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), and for him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), and holding the crucifix close to his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/>Presently the executioner pulled the friar roughly on one side, and in
a moment felled the culprit with a heavy mallet, and falling on him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>), cut
his (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) throat from ear to ear.

<p/>There was a cry of horror from the crowd.

<p/>The young friar swooned away.

<p/>A gigantic monk strode forward, and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) off like a child.

<p/>Brother Clement went back to the convent sadly discouraged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) confessed
to the prior, with tears of regret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, son Clement,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the prior. <div class="bookquote">``A Dominican is not made in
a day. Thou shalt have another trial. And I forbid thee to go to it
fasting.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>Clement bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) head in token of obedience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had not long
to wait. A robber was brought to the scaffold; a monster of villainy
and cruelty, who had killed men in pure wantonness, after robbing them.
Clement passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) last night in prison with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) to
the scaffold, and then prayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) and for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) so earnestly that the
hardened ruffian shed tears and embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) Clement embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
too, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) flesh quivered with repugnance; and held the crucifix
earnestly before his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes. The man was garotted, and Clement lost sight
of the crowd, and prayed loud and earnestly while that dark spirit was
passing from earth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was no sooner dead than the hangman raised his (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>)
hatchet and quartered the body on the spot. And, oh, mysterious heart
of man! the people who had seen the living body robbed of life with
indifference, almost with satisfaction, uttered a piteous cry at each
stroke of the axe upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) corpse that could feel nought. Clement too
shuddered then, but stood firm, like one of those rocks that vibrate but
cannot be thrown down. But suddenly Jerome's voice sounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brother Clement, get thee on that cart and preach to the people. Nay,
quickly! strike with all thy force on all this iron, while yet `tis hot,
and souls are to be saved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement's colour came and went; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) breathed hard. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) obeyed, and
with ill-assured step mounted the cart, and preached his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) first sermon
to the first crowd he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had ever faced. Oh, that sea of heads! His (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) throat
seemed parched, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) heart thumped, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) voice trembled.

<p/>By-and-by the greatness of the occasion, the sight of the eager upturned
faces, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) own heart full of zeal, fired the pale monk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) told them
this robber's history, warm from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) own lips in the prison, and showed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) hearers by that example the gradations of folly and crime, and
warned them solemnly not to put foot on the first round of that fatal
ladder. And as alternately he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) thundered against the shedders of blood,
and moved the crowd to charity and pity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) tremors left him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
felt all strung up like a lute, and gifted with an unsuspected force; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
was master of that listening crowd, could feel their very pulse,
could play sacred melodies on them as on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) psaltery. Sobs and groans
attested his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) power over the mob already excited by the tragedy before
them. Jerome stared like one who goes to light a stick; and fires a
rocket. After a while Clement caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) look of astonishment, and
seeing no approbation in it, broke suddenly off, and joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my first endeavour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``Your behest came
on me like a thunderbolt. Was I?--Did I?--Oh, correct me, and aid me
with your experience, Brother Jerome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>said Jerome doubtfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) added, rather sullenly after long
reflection, <div class="bookquote">``Give the glory to God, Brother Clement; my opinion is thou
art an orator born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) reported the same at headquarters, half reluctantly. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) was an
honest friar though a disagreeable one.

<p/>One Julio Antonelli was accused of sacrilege; three witnesses swore they
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonelli</b></font>) come out of the church whence the candle-sticks were stolen, and
at the very time. Other witnesses proved an alibi for him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonelli</b></font>) as positively.
Neither testimony could be shaken. In this doubt Antonelli was permitted
the trial by water, hot or cold. By the hot trial he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonelli</b></font>) must put his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonelli</b></font>) bare
arm into boiling water, fourteen inches deep, and take out a pebble; by
the cold trial his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonelli</b></font>) body must be let down into eight feet of water.
The clergy, who thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonelli</b></font>) innocent, recommended the hot water trial,
which, to those whom they favoured, was not so terrible as it sounded.
But the poor wretch had not the nerve, and chose the cold ordeal. And
this gave Jerome another opportunity of steeling Clement. Antonelli took
the sacrament, and then was stripped naked on the banks of the Tiber,
and tied hand and foot, to prevent those struggles by which a man,
throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms out of the water, sinks his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was then let down gently into the stream, and floated a moment, with
just his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair above water. A simultaneous roar from the crowd on
each bank proclaimed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guilty. But the next moment the ropes,
which happened to be new, got wet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) settled down. Another roar
proclaimed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) innocence. They left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the bottom of the river
the appointed time, rather more than half a minute, then drew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up,
gurgling and gasping, and screaming for mercy; and after the appointed
prayers, dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), cleared of the charge.

<p/>During the experiment Clement prayed earnestly on the bank.

<p/>When it was over he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) thanked God in a loud but slightly quavering voice.

<p/>By-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) asked Jerome whether the man ought not to be compensated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the pain, the dread, the suffocation. Poor soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) liveth, but
hath tasted all the bitterness of death. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had done no ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) is rewarded enough in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) is cleared of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But being innocent of that fault, yet hath he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) drunk Death's cup, though
not to the dregs; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) accusers, less innocent than he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), do suffer
nought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div><p/>Jerome replied somewhat sternly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not in this world men are really punished, Brother Clement.
Unhappy they who sin yet suffer not. And happy they who suffer such ills
as earth hath power to inflict; `tis counted to them above, ay, and a
hundred-fold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) head submissively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May thy good words not fall to the ground, but take root in my heart,
Brother Jerome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>But the severest trial Clement underwent at Jerome's hands was
unpremeditated. It came about thus. Jerome, in an indulgent moment, went
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) to Fra Colonna, and there <div class="bookquote">``The Dream of Polifilo''  (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div>lay on the
table just copied fairly. The poor author, in the pride of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) heart,
pointed out a master-stroke in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For ages,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``fools have been lavishing poetic praise and
amorous compliment on mortal women, mere creatures of earth, smacking
palpably of their origin; Sirens at the windows, where our Roman women
in particular have by lifelong study learned the wily art to show their
one good feature, though but an ear or an eyelash, at a jalosy, and
hide all the rest; Magpies at the door, Capre n' i giardini, Angeli in
Strada, Sante in chiesa, Diavoli in casa. Then come I and ransack the
minstrels' lines for amorous turns, not forgetting those which Petrarch
wasted on that French jilt Laura, the sliest of them all; and I lay you
the whole bundle of spice at the feet of the only females worthy amorous
incense; to wit, the Nine Muses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By which goodly stratagem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>said Jerome, who had been turning the pages
all this time, <div class="bookquote">``you, a friar of St. Dominic, have produced an obscene
book.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) dashed Polifilo on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Obscene? thou discourteous monk!''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>And the author ran round the table,
snatched Polifilo away, locked him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) up, and trembling with mortification,
said, <div class="bookquote">``My Gerard, pshaw! Brother What's-his-name had not found Polifilo
obscene. Puris omnia pura.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such as read your Polifilo--Heaven grant they may be few--will find him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>)
what I find him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Colonna gulped down this bitter pill as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) might; and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>)
not been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) own lodgings, and a high-born gentleman as well as a
scholar, there might have been a vulgar quarrel.

<p/>As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) made a great effort, and turned the conversation to
a beautiful chrysolite the Cardinal Colonna had lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>); and while
Clement handled it, enlarged on its moral virtues: for he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) went the whole
length of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) age as a worshipper of jewels.

<p/>But Jerome did not, and expostulated with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) for believing that one
dead stone could confer valour on its wearer, another chastity, another
safety from poison, another temperance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The experience of ages proves they do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div>said Colonna. <div class="bookquote">``As to the last
virtue you have named, there sits a living proof. This Gerard--I beg
pardon, Brother Thingemy--comes from the north, where men drink like
fishes; yet was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ever most abstemious. And why? Carried an amethyst,
the clearest and fullest coloured e'er I saw on any but noble finger.
Where, in Heaven's name, is thine amethyst? Show it this unbeliever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And `twas that amethyst made the boy temperate?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>asked Jerome
ironically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. Why, what is the derivation and meaning of amethyst? -LCB-a-RCB-
negative, and -LCB-methua-RCB- to tipple. Go to, names are but the signs of
things. A stone is not called -LCB-amethustos-RCB- for two thousand years out of
mere sport, and abuse of language.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) then went through the prime jewels, illustrating their moral
properties, especially of the ruby, the sapphire, the emerald, and the
opal, by anecdotes out of grave historians.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These be old wives' fables,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>said Jerome contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``Was ever such
credulity as thine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>credulity a reproach sceptics</b></font>)</div><p/>Now credulity is a reproach sceptics have often the ill-luck to incur;
but it mortifies them none the less for that.

<p/>The believer in stones writhed under it, and dropped the subject. Then
Jerome, mistaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) silence, exhorted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) to go a step farther, and
give up from this day his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) vain pagan lore, and study the lives of the
saints. <div class="bookquote">``Blot out these heathen superstitions from thy mind, brother, as
Christianity hath blotted them from the earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And in this strain he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) proceeded, repeating, incautiously, some current
but loose theological statements. Then the smarting Polifilo revenged
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) flew out, and hurled a mountain of crude, miscellaneous
lore upon Jerome, of which, partly for want of time, partly for lack of
learning, I can reproduce but a few fragments.

<p/>``The heathen blotted out? Why, they hold four-fifths of the world. And
what have we Christians invented without their aid? painting? sculpture?
these are heathen arts, and we but pigmies at them. What modern mind
can conceive and grave so god-like forms as did the chief Athenian
sculptors, and the Libyan Licas, and Dinocrates of Macedon, and Scopas,
Timotheus, Leochares, and Briaxis; Chares, Lysippus, and the immortal
three of Rhodes, that wrought Laocoon from a single block? What prince
hath the genius to turn mountains into statues, as was done at Bagistan,
and projected at Athos? What town the soul to plant a colossus of brass
in the sea, for the tallest ships to sail in and out between his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) legs?
Is it architecture we have invented? Why, here too we are but children.
Can we match for pure design the Parthenon, with its clusters of double
and single Doric columns? -LRB-I do adore the Doric when the scale is
large-RRB-, and for grandeur and finish, the theatres of Greece and Rome,
or the prodigious temples of Egypt, up to whose portals men walked
awe-struck through avenues a mile long of sphinxes, each as big as a
Venetian palace. And all these prodigies of porphyry cut and polished
like crystal, not rough hewn as in our puny structures. Even now their
polished columns and pilasters lie o’erthrown and broken, o’ergrown with
acanthus and myrtle, but sparkling still, and flouting the slovenly art
of modern workmen. Is it sewers, aqueducts, viaducts?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, we have lost the art of making a road--lost it with the world's
greatest models under our very eye. Is it sepulchres of the dead? Why,
no Christian nation has ever erected a tomb, the sight of which does not
set a scholar laughing. Do but think of the Mausoleum, and the Pyramids,
and the monstrous sepulchres of the Indus and Ganges, which outside are
mountains, and within are mines of precious stones. Ah, you have not
seen the East, Jerome, or you could not decry the heathen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div><p/>Jerome observed that these were mere material things. True greatness was
in the soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div>replied Colonna, ``in the world of mind, what have we
discovered? Is it geometry? Is it logic? Nay, we are all pupils of
Euclid and Aristotle. Is it written characters, an invention almost
divine? We no more invented it than Cadmus did. Is it poetry? Homer hath
never been approached by us, nor hath Virgil, nor Horace. Is it tragedy
or comedy? Why, poets, actors, theatres, all fell to dust at our
touch. Have we succeeded in reviving them? Would you compare our little
miserable mysteries and moralities, all frigid personification, and dog
Latin, with the glories of a Greek play -LRB-on the decoration of which
a hundred thousand crowns had been spent-RRB- performed inside a marble
miracle, the audience a seated city, and the poet a Sophocles?

<p/>``What then have we invented? Is it monotheism? Why, the learned and
philosophical among the Greeks and Romans held it; even their more
enlightened poets were monotheists in their sleeves.

<p/>-LCB-Zeus estin ouranos, Zeus te gy Zeus toi panta-RCB-
saith the Greek, and Lucan echoes him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucan</b></font>):
`Jupiter est quod cunque vides quo cunque moveris.'

<p/>``Their vulgar were polytheists; and what are ours? We have not invented
`invocation of the saints.' Our sancti answers to their Daemones and
Divi, and the heathen used to pray their Divi or deified mortal to
intercede with the higher divinity; but the ruder minds among them,
incapable of nice distinctions, worshipped those lesser gods they should
have but invoked. And so do the mob of Christians in our day, following
the heathen vulgar or by unbroken tradition. For in holy writ is no
polytheism of any sort or kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have not invented so much as a form or variety of polytheism. The
pagan vulgar worshipped all sorts of deified mortals, and each had his (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>)
favourite, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>) prayed ten times for once to the Omnipotent. Our
vulgar worship canonized mortals, and each has his (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>) favourite, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>)
prays ten times for once to God. Call you that invention? Invention is
confined to the East. Among the ancient vulgar only the mariners were
monotheists; they worshipped Venus; called her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) `Stella maris,' and
`Regina caelorum.' Among our vulgar only the mariners are monotheists;
they worship the Virgin Mary, and call her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) the `Star of the Sea,' and
the `Queen of Heaven.' Call you theirs a new religion? An old doubtlet
with a new button. Our vulgar make images, and adore them, which is
absurd; for adoration is the homage due from a creature to its creator;
now here man is the creator; so the statues ought to worship him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and
would, if they had brains enough to justify a rat in worshipping them.
But even this abuse, though childish enough to be modern, is ancient.
The pagan vulgar in these parts made their images, then knelt before
them, adorned them with flowers, offered incense to them, lighted tapers
before them, carried them in procession, and made pilgrimages to them
just to the smallest tittle as we their imitators do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div><p/>Jerome here broke in impatiently, and reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) that the images the
most revered in Christendom were made by no mortal hand, but had dropped
from heaven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div>cried Colonna, <div class="bookquote">``such are the tutelary images of most great Italian
towns. I have examined nineteen of them, and made drafts of them. If
they came from the sky, our worst sculptors are our angels. But my mind
is easy on that score. Ungainly statue or villainous daub fell never yet
from heaven to smuggle the bread out of capable workmen's mouths. All
this is Pagan, and arose thus. The Trojans had Oriental imaginations,
and feigned that their Palladium, a wooden statue three cubits long,
fell down from heaven. The Greeks took this fib home among the spoils
of Troy, and soon it rained statues on all the Grecian cities, and their
Latin apes. And one of these Palladia gave St. Paul trouble at Ephesus;
`twas a statue of Diana that fell down from Jupiter: credat qui credere
possit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, would you cast your profane doubts on that picture of our blessed
Lady, which scarce a century agone hung lustrous in the air over this
very city, and was taken down by the Pope and bestowed in St. Peter's
Church?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I have no profane doubts on the matter, Jerome. This is the story of
Numa's shield, revived by theologians with an itch for fiction, but no
talent that way; not being orientals. The `ancile' or sacred shield
of Numa hung lustrous in the air over this very city, till that pious
prince took it down and hung it in the temple of Jupiter. Be just,
swallow both stories or neither. The `Bocca della Verita' passes for a
statue of the Virgin, and convicted a woman of perjury the other day;
it is in reality an image of the goddess Rhea, and the modern figment is
one of its ancient traditions; swallow both or neither.

<p/>`Qui Bavium non odit amet tua carmina, Mavi.'

<p/>``But indeed we owe all our Palladiuncula, and all our speaking, nodding,
winking, sweating, bleeding statues, to these poor abused heathens; the
Athenian statues all sweated before the battle of Chaeronea, so did the
Roman statues during Tully's consulship, viz., the statue of Victory at
Capua, of Mars at Rome, and of Apollo outside the gates. The Palladium
itself was brought to Italy by Aeneas, and after keeping quiet three
centuries, made an observation in Vesta's Temple: a trivial one, I fear,
since it hath not survived; Juno's statue at Veii assented with a nod to
go to Rome. Antony's statue on Mount Alban bled from every vein in its
marble before the fight of Actium. Others cured diseases: as that of
Pelichus, derided by Lucian; for the wiser among the heathen believed in
sweating marble, weeping wood, and bleeding brass--as I do. Of all our
marks and dents made in stone by soft substances, this saint's knee, and
that saint's finger, and t'other's head, the original is heathen. Thus
the footprints of Hercules were shown on a rock in Scythia. Castor and
Pollux fighting on white horses for Rome against the Latians, left the
prints of their hoofs on a rock at Regillum. A temple was built to them
on the spot, and the marks were to be seen in Tully's day. You may see,
near Venice, a great stone cut nearly in half by St. George's sword.
This he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ne’er had done but for the old Roman who cut the whetstone in
two with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) razor.

<p/>`Qui Bavium non odit amet tua carmina, Mavi.'

<p/>``Kissing of images, and the Pope's toe, is Eastern Paganism. The
Egyptians had it of the Assyrians, the Greeks of the Egyptians, the
Romans of the Greeks, and we of the Romans, whose Pontifex Maximus had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) toe kissed under the Empire. The Druids kissed the High Priest's toe
a thousand years B.C.. The Mussulmans, who, like you, profess to abhor
Heathenism, kiss the stone of the Caaba: a Pagan practice.

<p/>``The Priests of Baal kissed their idols so.

<p/>``Tully tells us of a fair image of Hercules at Agrigentum, whose chin
was worn by kissing. The lower parts of the statue we call Peter are
Jupiter. The toe is sore worn, but not all by Christian mouths. The
heathen vulgar laid their lips there first, for many a year, and ours
have but followed them, as monkeys their masters. And that is why, down
with the poor heathen!

<p/>Pereant qui ante nos nostra fecerint.

<p/>``Our infant baptism is Persian, with the font and the signing of the
child's brow. Our throwing three handfuls of earth on the coffin, and
saying dust to dust, is Egyptian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our incense is Oriental, Roman, Pagan; and the early Fathers of the
Church regarded it with superstitious horror, and died for refusing to
handle it. Our Holy water is Pagan, and all its uses. See, here is a
Pagan aspersorium. Could you tell it from one of ours? It stood in the
same part of their temples, and was used in ordinary worship as ours,
and in extraordinary purifications. They called it Aqua lustralis. Their
vulgar, like ours, thought drops of it falling on the body would wash
out sin; and their men of sense, like ours, smiled or sighed at such
credulity. What saith Ovid of this folly, which hath outlived him (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>)?

<p/>`Ah nimium faciles, qui tristia crimina coedis
Fluminea tolli posse putetis aqua.'

<p/>Thou seest the heathen were not all fools. No more are we. Not all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div><p/>Fra Colonna uttered all this with such volubility, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) hearers
could not edge in a word of remonstrance; and not being interrupted
in praising his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) favourites, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) good humour, without any
diminution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) volubility.

<p/>``We celebrate the miraculous Conception of the Virgin on the 2nd of
February. The old Romans celebrated the Miraculous Conception of Juno on
the 2nd of February. Our feast of All Saints is on the 2nd November. The
Festum Dei Mortis was on the 2nd November. Our Candlemas is also an old
Roman feast; neither the date nor the ceremony altered one tittle.
The patrician ladies carried candles about the city that night as our
signoras do now. At the gate of San Croce our courtesans keep a feast
on the 20th August. Ask them why! The little noodles cannot tell you. On
that very spot stood the Temple of Venus. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) building is gone; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>)
rite remains. Did we discover Purgatory? On the contrary, all we really
know about it is from two treatises of Plato, the Gorgias and the
Phaedo, and the sixth book of Virgil's Aeneid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I take it from a holier source: St. Gregory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>said Jerome sternly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div>replied Colonna drily. ``But St. Gregory was not so nice;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) took it from Virgil. Some souls, saith Gregory, are purged by fire,
others by water, others by air.

<p/>``Says Virgil--

<p/>`Aliae panduntur inanes,
Suspensae ad ventous, aliis sub gurgite vasto
Infectum eluitur scelus, aut exuritur igni.'

<p/>But peradventure, you think Pope Gregory I lived before Virgil, and
Virgil versified him (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the doctrine is Eastern, and as much older than Plato as Plato
than Gregory. Our prayers for the dead came from Asia with Aeneas. Ovid
tells, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) prayed for the soul of Anchises, the custom was
strange in Italy.

<p/>`Hunc morem Aeneas, pietatis idoneus auctor
Attulit in terras, juste Latine, tuas.'

<p/>The `Biblicae' Sortes,' which I have seen consulted on the altar, are
a parody on the `Sortes Virgilianae.' Our numerous altars in one church
are heathen: the Jews, who are monotheists, have but one altar in a
church. But the Pagans had many, being polytheists. In the temple of
Pathian Venus were a hundred of them. `Centum que Sabaeo thure calent
arae.' Our altar's and our hundred lights around St. Peter's tomb are
Pagan. `Centum aras posuit vigilemque sacraverat ignem.' We invent
nothing, not even numerically. Our very Devil is the god Pan, horns and
hoofs and all; but blackened. For we cannot draw; we can but daub the
figures of Antiquity with a little sorry paint or soot. Our Moses hath
stolen the horns of Ammon; our Wolfgang the hook of Saturn; and Janus
bore the keys of heaven before St. Peter. All our really old Italian
bronzes of the Virgin and Child are Venuses and Cupids. So is the wooden
statue, that stands hard by this house, of Pope Joan and the child
she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) is said to have brought forth there in the middle of a procession.
Idiots! are new-born children thirteen years old? And that boy is not a
day younger. Cupid! Cupid! Cupid! And since you accuse me of credulity,
know that to my mind that Papess is full as mythological, born of froth,
and every way unreal, as the goddess who passes for her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) in the next
street, or as the saints you call St. Baccho and St. Quirina: or St.
Oracte, which is a dunce-like corruption of Mount Soracte, or St.
Amphibolus, an English saint, which is a dunce-like corruption of the
cloak worn by their St. Alban, Or as the Spanish saint, St. Viar: which
words on his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) tombstone, written thus, `S. Viar,' prove him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) no saint,
but a good old nameless heathen, and `praefectus Viarum,' or overseer
of roads -LRB-would he (<font color='blue'><b>overseer</b></font>) were back to earth, and paganizing of our Christian
roads!-RRB-, or as our St. Veronica of Benasco, which Veronica is a
dunce-like corruption of the `Vera icon,' which this saint brought
into the church. I wish it may not be as unreal as the donor, Or as the
eleven thousand virgins of Cologne, who were but a couple.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) to inquire what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) meant. <div class="bookquote">``I have spoken with
those have seen their bones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``What, of eleven thousand virgins all collected in one place and at one
time? Do but bethink thee, Clement. Not one of the great Eastern cities
of antiquity could collect eleven thousand Pagan virgins at one time,
far less a puny Western city. Eleven thousand Christian virgins in a
little, wee, Paynim city!

<p/>`Quod cunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi.'

<p/>The simple sooth is this. The martyrs were two: the Breton princess
herself, falsely called British, and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) maid, Onesimilla, which is
a Greek name, Onesima, diminished. This some fool did mis-pronounce
undecim mille, eleven thousand: loose tongue found credulous ears, and
so one fool made many; eleven thousand of them, an' you will. And you
charge me with credulity, Jerome? and bid me read the Lives of the
Saints. Well, I have read them, and many a dear old Pagan acquaintance
I found there. The best fictions in the book are Oriental, and are known
to have been current in Persia and Arabia eight hundred years and more
before the dates the Church assigns to them as facts. As for the true
Western figments, they lack the Oriental plausibility. Think you I am
credulous enough to believe that St. Ida joined a decapitated head to
its body? that Cuthbert's carcass directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) bearers where to go, and
where to stop; that a city was eaten up of rats to punish one Hatto
for comparing the poor to mice; that angels have a little horn in
their foreheads, and that this was seen and recorded at the time by
St. Veronica of Benasco, who never existed, and hath left us this
information and a miraculous handkercher? For my part, I think the
holiest woman the world ere saw must have an existence ere she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can have
a handkercher or an eye to take unicorns for angels. Think you I believe
that a brace of lions turned sextons and helped Anthony bury Paul of
Thebes? that Patrick, a Scotch saint, stuck a goat's beard on all the
descendants of one that offended him (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>)? that certain thieves, having
stolen the convent ram, and denying it, St. Pol de Leon bade the ram
bear witness, and straight the mutton bleated in the thief's belly?
Would you have me give up the skilful figments of antiquity for such old
wives' fables as these? The ancients lied about animals, too; but then
they lied logically; we unreasonably. Do but compare Ephis and his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>)
lion, or, better still, Androcles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) lion, with Anthony and his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) two
lions. Both the Pagan lions do what lions never did' but at the least
they act in character. A lion with a bone in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) throat, or a thorn
in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) foot, could not do better than be civil to a man. But Anthony's
lions are asses in a lion's skin. What leonine motive could they have in
turning sextons? A lion's business is to make corpses, not inter them.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) added, with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``Our lies are as inferior to the lies of the
ancients as our statues, and for the same reason; we do not study nature
as they did. We are imitatores, servum pecus. Believe you `the lives of
the saints;' that Paul the Theban was the first hermit, and Anthony the
first Caenobite? Why, Pythagoras was an Eremite, and under ground for
seven years; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) daughter was an abbess. Monks and hermits were in
the East long before Moses, and neither old Greece nor Rome was ever
without them. As for St. Francis and his (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) snowballs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) did but mimic
Diogenes, who, naked, embraced statues on which snow had fallen. The
folly without the poetry. Ape of an ape--for Diogenes was but a mimic
therein of the Brahmins and Indian gymnosophists. Natheless, the
children of this Francis bid fair to pelt us out of the Church with
their snowballs. Tell me now, Clement, what habit is lovelier than
the vestments of our priests? Well, we owe them all to Numa Pompilius,
except the girdle and the stole, which are judaical. As for the amice
and the albe, they retain the very names they bore in Numa's day. The
`pelt' worn by the canons comes from primeval Paganism. `Tis a relic
of those rude times when the sacrificing priest wore the skins of the
beasts with the fur outward. Strip off thy black gown, Jerome, thy
girdle and cowl, for they come to us all three from the Pagan ladies.
Let thy hair grow like Absolom's, Jerome! for the tonsure is as Pagan as
the Muses.''

year in which the Church did first ordain it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not invent it, Jerome. The Brahmins wore it a few thousands years
ere that. From them it came through the Assyrians to the priests of Isis
in Egypt, and afterwards of Serapis at Athens. The late Pope -LRB-the saints
be good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)-RRB- once told me the tonsure was forbidden by God to the
Levites in the Pentateuch. If so, this was because of the Egyptian
priests wearing it. I trust to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) holiness. I am no biblical scholar.
The Latin of thy namesake Jerome is a barrier I cannot overleap. `Dixit
ad me Dominus Dens. Dixi ad Dominum Deum.' No, thank you, holy Jerome;
I can stand a good deal, but I cannot stand thy Latin. Nay; give me the
New Testament! `Tis not the Greek of Xenophon; but `tis Greek. And there
be heathen sayings in it too. For St. Paul was not so spiteful against
them as thou. When the heathen said a good thing that suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) matter,
by Jupiter he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) just took it, and mixed it to all eternity with the

He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) ran and hallooed joyfully after Jerome. <div class="bookquote">``And that is Pagan. Burning

<p/>But ere they could get clear of the house a jalosy was flung open, and
the Paynim monk came out head and shoulders, and overhung the street
shouting,

<p/>``Affecti suppliciis Chrisitiani, genus hominum
Novas superstitionis ac maleficae,'''

<p/>And having delivered this parting blow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) felt a great triumphant joy,
and strode exultant to and fro; and not attending with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) usual care
to the fair way -LRB-for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) room could only be threaded by little paths
wriggling among the antiquities-RRB-, tripped over the beak of an Egyptian
stork, and rolled upon a regiment of Armenian gods, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) found tough
in argument though small in stature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will go no more to that heretical monk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>said Jerome to Clement.

<p/>Clement sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we leave him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) and not try to correct him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>)? Make

by the Fra Colonna's lodging, and had stopped a little while in the
street, and then gone on, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes and slowly.

submission.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXIII

<p/>THE HEARTH

<p/>A Catherine is not an unmixed good in a strange house. The governing
power is strong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has scarce crossed the threshold ere the
utensils seem to brighten; the hearth to sweep itself; the windows to
let in more light; and the soul of an enormous cricket to animate
the dwelling-place. But this cricket is a Busy Body. And that is a
tremendous character. It has no discrimination. It sets everything to
rights, and everybody. Now many things are the better for being set to
rights. But everything is not. Everything is the one thing that won't
stand being set to rights; except in that calm and cool retreat, the
grave.

<p/>Catherine altered the position of every chair and table in Margaret's
house; and perhaps for the better.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) must go farther, and upset the live furniture.

<p/>When Margaret's time was close at hand, Catherine treacherously invited
the aid of Denys and Martin; and on the poor, simple-minded fellows
asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) earnestly what service they could be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) told them they
might make themselves comparatively useful by going for a little walk.
So far so good. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) intimated further that should the promenade
extend into the middle of next week all the better. This was not
ingratiating. The subsequent conduct of the strong under the yoke of the
weak might have propitiated a she-bear with three cubs, one sickly.
They generally slipped out of the house at daybreak; and stole in like
thieves at night; and if by any chance they were at home, they went
about like cats on a wall tipped with broken glass, and wearing
awe-struck visages, and a general air of subjugation and depression.

<p/>But all would not do. Their very presence was ill-timed; and jarred upon
Catherine's nerves.

<p/>Did instinct whisper, a pair of depopulators had no business in a house
with multipliers twain?

<p/>The breastplate is no armour against a female tongue; and Catherine ran
infinite pins and needles of speech into them. In a word, when Margaret
came down stairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found the kitchen swept of heroes.

<p/>Martin, old and stiff, had retreated no farther than the street, and
with the honours of war: for he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) baggage, a stool;
and sat on it in the air.

<p/>Margaret saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was out in the sun; but was not aware he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was a fixture
in that luminary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) asked for Denys. <div class="bookquote">``Good, kind Denys; he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) will be
right pleased to see me about again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine, wiping a bowl with now superfluous vigour, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) Denys was
gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) friends in Burgundy. <div class="bookquote">``And high time, Hasn't been anigh them
this three years, by all accounts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, gone without bidding me farewell?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, uplifting two
tender eyes like full-blown violets.

<p/>Catherine reddened. For this new view of the matter set her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conscience
pricking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gave a little toss and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you were asleep at the time:
and I would not have you wakened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Denys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, and the dew gathered visibly on the open
violets.

<p/>Catherine saw out of the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eye, and without taking a bit of
open notice, slipped off and lavished hospitality and tenderness on the
surviving depopulator.

<p/>It was sudden: and Martin old and stiff in more ways than one--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, dame. I have got used to out o' doors. And I love not
changing and changing. I meddle wi' nobody here; and nobody meddles wi'
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Wittenhaagen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you nasty, cross old wretch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>screamed Catherine, passing in a
moment from treacle to sharpest vinegar. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) flounced back into the
house.

<p/>On calm reflection she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had a little cry. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) half reconciled
herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conduct by vowing to be so kind, Margaret should never
miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) plagues of soldiers. But feeling still a little uneasy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
dispersed all regrets by a process at once simple and sovereign.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took and washed the child.

<p/>From head to foot she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) washed him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) in tepid water; and heroes, and their
wrongs, became as dust in an ocean--of soap and water.

<p/>While this celestial ceremony proceeded, Margaret could not keep quiet.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hovered round the fortunate performer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must have an apparent
hand in it, if not a real. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) finger into the water--to pave
the way for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy, I suppose; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not have deceived herself
so far as to think Catherine would allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to settle the temperature.
During the ablution she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kneeled down opposite the little Gerard, and
prattled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with amazing fluency; taking care, however, not to
articulate like grown-up people; for, how could a cherub understand
their ridiculous pronunciation?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you could wash out THAT,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes on the
little boy's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, have you not noticed? on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) little finger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Granny</b></font>)</div><p/>Granny looked, and there was a little brown mole,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, but this is wonderful!''  (<font color='red'><b>a mole</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Nature, my lass, y’are strong;
and meddlesome to boot. Hast noticed such a mark on some one else? Tell
the truth, girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, on him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)? Nay, mother, not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) has; and on the very spot. And you never noticed that
much. But, dear heart, I forgot; you han't known him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) from child to man
as I have, I have had him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) hundreds o' times on my knees, the same
as this, and washed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) from top to toe in luke-warm water.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Granny</b></font>)
swelled with conscious superiority; and Margaret looked meekly up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
as a woman beyond competition.

<p/>Catherine looked down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dizzy height and moralized. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) differed
from other busy-bodies in this, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) now and then reflected: not
deeply; or of course I should take care not to print it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how things come round and about, Life is but
a whirligig. Leastways, we poor women, our lives are all cut upon one
pattern. Wasn't I for washing out my Gerard's mole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) young days?
`Oh, fie! here's a foul blot,' quo' I; and scrubbed away at it I did
till I made the poor wight cry; so then I thought `twas time to give
over. And now says you to me, `Mother,' says you, `do try and wash you
out o' my Gerard's finger,' says you. Think on't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wash it out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't for all the world, Why, it is
the sweetest bit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) little darling body. I'll kiss it morn and night
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) that owned it first comes back to us three, Oh, bless you,
my jewel of gold and silver, for being marked like your own daddy, to
comfort me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kissed little Gerard's little mole; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not stop
there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) presently had him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sprawling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lap, and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
back all over again and again, and seemed to worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) as wolf a lamb;
Catherine looking on and smiling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had seen a good many of these
savage onslaughts in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) day.

<p/>And this little sketch indicates the tenor of Margaret's life for
several months, One or two small things occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) during that time
which must be told; but I reserve them, since one string will serve for
many glass beads. But while her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy's father was passing through those
fearful tempests of the soul, ending in the dead monastic calm, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) life
might fairly be summed in one great blissful word--Maternity.

<p/>You, who know what lies in that word, enlarge my little sketch, and see
the young mother nursing and washing, and dressing and undressing, and
crowing and gambolling with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) first-born; then swifter than lightning
dart your eye into Italy, and see the cold cloister; and the monks
passing like ghosts, eyes down, hands meekly crossed over bosoms dead to
earthly feelings.

<p/>One of these cowled ghosts is he (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), whose return, full of love, and youth,
and joy, that radiant young mother awaits.


<p/>In the valley of Grindelwald the traveller has on one side the
perpendicular Alps, all rock, ice, and everlasting snow, towering above
the clouds, and piercing to the sky; on his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) other hand little every-day
slopes, but green as emeralds, and studded with cows and pretty cots,
and life; whereas those lofty neighbours stand leafless, lifeless,
inhuman, sublime. Elsewhere sweet commonplaces of nature are apt to pass
unnoticed; but, fronting the grim Alps, they soothe, and even gently
strike, the mind by contrast with their tremendous opposites. Such, in
their way, are the two halves of this story, rightly looked at; on
the Italian side rugged adventure, strong passion, blasphemy, vice,
penitence, pure ice, holy snow, soaring direct at heaven. On the Dutch
side, all on a humble scale and womanish, but ever green. And as a
pathway parts the ice towers of Grindelwald, aspiring to the sky, from
its little sunny braes, so here is but a page between

<p/><div class="bookquote">``the Cloister and the Hearth.''



 (<font color='red'><b>THE pope</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXIV

<p/>THE CLOISTER

<p/>THE new pope favoured the Dominican order. The convent received a
message from the Vatican, requiring a capable friar to teach at the
University of Basle. Now Clement was the very monk for this: well versed
in languages, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) worldly days had attended the lectures of
Guarini the younger. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) visit to England was therefore postponed though
not resigned; and meantime he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was sent to Basle; but not being wanted
there for three months, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was to preach on the road.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) passed out of the northern gate with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes lowered, and the whole
man wrapped in pious contemplation.

<p/>Oh, if we could paint a mind and its story, what a walking fresco was
this barefooted friar!

<p/>Hopeful, happy love, bereavement, despair, impiety, vice, suicide,
remorse, religious despondency, penitence, death to the world,
resignation.

<p/>And all in twelve short months.

<p/>And now the traveller was on foot again. But all was changed: no
perilous adventures now. The very thieves and robbers bowed to the
ground before him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), and instead of robbing him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), forced stolen money on
him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), and begged his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) prayers.

<p/>This journey therefore furnished few picturesque incidents. I have,
however, some readers to think of, who care little for melodrama, and
expect a quiet peep at what passes inside a man, To such students things
undramatic are often vocal, denoting the progress of a mind.

<p/>The first Sunday of Clement's journey was marked by this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) prayed for
the soul of Margaret. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had never done so before. Not that her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eternal
welfare was not dearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) than anything on earth. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
humility. The terrible impieties that burst from him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) on the news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
death horrified my well-disposed readers; but not as on reflection they
horrified him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) who had uttered them. For a long time during his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) novitiate
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was oppressed with religious despair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) must have
committed that sin against the Holy Spirit which dooms the soul for
ever, By degrees that dark cloud cleared away, Anselmo juvante; but
deep self-abasement remained. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) own salvation insecure, and
moreover thought it would be mocking Heaven, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), the deeply
stained, pray for a soul so innocent, comparatively, as Margaret's. So
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) used to coax good Anselm and another kindly monk to pray for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).
They did not refuse, nor do it by halves. In general the good old monks
-LRB-and there were good, bad, and indifferent in every convent-RRB- had a pure
and tender affection for their younger brethren, which, in truth, was
not of this world.

<p/>Clement then, having preached on Sunday morning in a small Italian town,
and being mightily carried onward, was greatly encouraged; and that day
a balmy sense of God's forgiveness and love descended on him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
prayed for the welfare of Margaret's soul. And from that hour this
became his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) daily habit, and the one purified tie, that by memory
connected his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart with earth.

<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) family were to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as if they had never been.

<p/>The Church would not share with earth. Nor could even the Church cure
the great love without annihilating the smaller ones.

<p/>During most of this journey Clement rarely felt any spring of life
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was in the pulpit. The other exceptions were,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) happened to relieve some fellow-creature.

<p/>A young man was tarantula bitten, or perhaps, like many more, fancied
it. Fancy or reality, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been for two days without sleep, and in
most extraordinary convulsions, leaping, twisting, and beating the
walls. The village musicians had only excited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worse with their
music. Exhaustion and death followed the disease, when it gained such a
head. Clement passed by and learned what was the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) sent for a
psaltery, and tried the patient with soothing melodies; but if the other
tunes maddened him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), Clement's seemed to crush him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) groaned and moaned
under them, and grovelled on the floor. At last the friar observed that
at intervals his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) lips kept going. He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) applied his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) ear, and found the
patient was whispering a tune; and a very singular one, that had no
existence. He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) learned this tune and played it. The patient's face
brightened amazingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) marched about the room on the light fantastic
toe enjoying it; and when Clement's fingers ached nearly off with
playing it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had the satisfaction of seeing the young man sink
complacently to sleep to this lullaby, the strange creation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) own
mind; for it seems he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was no musician, and never composed a tune before
or after. This sleep saved his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) life. And Clement, after teaching the
tune to another, in case it should be wanted again, went forward with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) heart a little warmer. On another occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) found a mob haling
a decently dressed man along, who struggled and vociferated, but in
a strange language. This person had walked into their town erect and
sprightly, waving a mulberry branch over his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) head. Thereupon the natives
first gazed stupidly, not believing their eyes, then pounced on him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) and
dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) before the podesta, Clement went with them; but on the way
drew quietly near the prisoner and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) in Italian; no answer.
In French' German; Dutch; no assets. Then the man tried Clement
in tolerable Latin, but with a sharpish accent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was an
Englishman, and oppressed with the heat of Italy, had taken a bough off
the nearest tree, to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``In my country anybody is welcome to
what grows on the highway. Confound the fools; I am ready to pay for it.
But here is all Italy up in arms about a twig and a handful of leaves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the islander</b></font>)</div><p/>The pig-headed podesta would have sent the dogged islander to prison;
but Clement mediated, and with some difficulty made the prisoner
comprehend that silkworms, and by consequence mulberry leaves, were
sacred, being under the wing of the Sovereign, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) source of income;
and urged on the podesta that ignorance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) mulberry laws was natural
in a distant country, where the very tree perhaps was unknown, The
opinionative islander turned the still vibrating scale by pulling' out
a long purse and repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) original theory, that the whole question
was mercantile. <div class="bookquote">``Quid damni?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Dic; et cito solvam.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The
podesta snuffed the gold: fined him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) a ducat for the duke; about the
value of the whole tree; and pouched the coin.

<p/>The Englishman shook off his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) ire the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) was liberated, and
laughed heartily at the whole thing; but was very grateful to Clement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too good for this hole of a country, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Come
to England! That is the only place in the world, I was an uneasy fool to
leave it, and wander among mulberries and their idiots. I am a Kentish
squire, and educated at Cambridge University. My name it is Rolfe, my
place Betshanger, The man and the house are both at your service. Come
over and stay till domesday. We sit down forty to dinner every day at
Betshanger. One more or one less at the board will not be seen. You
shall end your days with me and my heirs if you will, Come now! What an
Englishman says he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) means.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) a great hearty grip of the
hand to confirm it,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will visit thee some day, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Clement; <div class="bookquote">``but not to weary
thy hospitality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>The Englishman then begged Clement to shrive him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I know not what
will become of my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I live like a heathen since I left
England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement consented gladly, and soon the islander was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) knees to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
by the roadside, confessing the last month's sins.

<p/>Finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) so pious a son of the Church, Clement let him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) know he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was
really coming to England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) then asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) whether it was true that
country was overrun with Lollards and Wickliffites.

<p/>The other coloured up a little. <div class="bookquote">``There be black sheep in every land,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>). Then after some reflection he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) said gravely, <div class="bookquote">``Holy father, hear
the truth about these heretics. None are better disposed towards Holy
Church than we English. But we are ourselves, and by ourselves. We love
our own ways, and above all, our own tongue. The Norman could conquer
our bill-hooks, but not our tongues; and hard they tried it for many a
long year by law and proclamation. Our good foreign priests utter God
to plain English folk in Latin, or in some French or Italian lingo, like
the bleating of a sheep. Then come the fox Wickliff and his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) crew, and
read him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) own book in plain English, that all men's hearts
warm to. Who can withstand this? God forgive me, I believe the English
would turn deaf ears to St, Peter himself, spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) not to them in the
tongue their mothers sowed in their ears and their hearts along with
mothers' kisses.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) added hastily, <div class="bookquote">``I say not this for myself; I am
Cambridge bred; and good words come not amiss to me in Latin; but for
the people in general. Clavis ad corda Anglorum est lingua materna.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement, <div class="bookquote">``blessed be the hour I met thee; for thy words
are sober and wise. But alas! how shall I learn your English tongue? No
book have I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would give you my book of hours, father. `Tis in English and Latin,
cheek by jowl. But then, what would become of my poor soul, wanting my
`hours' in a strange land? Stay, you are a holy man, and I am an honest
one; let us make a bargain; you to pray for me every day for two months,
and I to give you my book of hours. Here it is. What say you to that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes sparkled, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was all on fire with mercantility.

<p/>Clement smiled gently at this trait; and quietly detached a MS. from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
girdle, and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) that it was in Latin and Italian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Italian</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Heaven hath foreseen our several needs, and
given us the means to satisfy them: let us change books; and, my dear
son, I will give thee my poor prayers and welcome, not sell them thee. I
love not religious bargains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The islander was delighted. <div class="bookquote">``So shall I learn the Italian tongue without
risk to my eternal weal, Near is my purse, but nearer is my soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Italian</b></font>) forced money on Clement. In vain the friar told him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) it was contrary
to his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) vow to carry more of that than was barely necessary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lay it out for the good of the Church and of my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>the islander</b></font>)</div>said the
islander. <div class="bookquote">``I ask you not to keep it, but take it you must and shall.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) grasped Clement's hand warmly again; and Clement kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) on
the brow, and blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), and they went each his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) way.

<p/>About a mile from where they parted, Clement found two tired wayfarers
lying in the deep shade of a great chestnut-tree, one of a thick
grove the road skirted. Near the men was a little cart, and in it
a printing-press, rude and clumsy as a vine-press, A jaded mule was
harnessed to the cart.

<p/>And so Clement stood face to face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) old enemy.

<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyed it, and the honest, blue-eyed faces of the wearied
craftsmen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) looked back as on a dream at the bitterness he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had once
felt towards this machine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) looked kindly down on them, and said
softly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sweynheim!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>The men started to their feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pannartz!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They scuttled into the wood, and were seen no more.

<p/>Clement was amazed, and stood puzzling himself.

<p/>Presently a face peeped from behind a tree.

<p/>Clement addressed it, <div class="bookquote">``What fear ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>A quavering voice replied--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, rather, by what magic you, a stranger, can call us by our names! I
never clapt eyes on you till now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, superstition! I know ye, as all good workmen are known--by your
works. Come hither and I will tell ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They advanced gingerly from different sides; each regulating his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) advance
by the other's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement, <div class="bookquote">``I saw a Lactantius in Rome, printed by
Sweynheim and Pannartz, disciples of Fust.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``D’ye hear that, Pannartz? our work has gotten to Rome already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By your blue eyes and flaxen hair I wist ye were Germans; and the
printing-press spoke for itself. Who then should ye be but Fust's
disciples, Pannartz and Sweynheim?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Germans</b></font>)</div><p/>The honest Germans were now astonished that they had suspected magic in
so simple a matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The good father hath his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wits about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), that is all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pannartz</b></font>)</div>said Pannartz.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sweynheim</b></font>)</div>said Sweynheim, <div class="bookquote">``and with those wits would he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could tell us how to
get this tired beast to the next town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sweynheim</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sweynheim</b></font>)</div>said Sweynheim, <div class="bookquote">``and where to find money to pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meat and
ours when we get there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sweynheim</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement. <div class="bookquote">``Free the mule of the cart, and of all
harness but the bare halter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a kitten</b></font>)</div><p/>This was done, and the animal immediately lay down and rolled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
back in the dust like a kitten. Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was thus employed, Clement
assured them he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) would rise up a new mule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Creator hath taught him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) this art to refresh himself, which the
nobler horse knoweth not. Now, with regard to money, know that a worthy
Englishman hath entrusted me with a certain sum to bestow in charity.
To whom can I better give a stranger's money than to strangers? Take it,
then, and be kind to some Englishman or other stranger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) need; and
may all nations learn to love one another one day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the workmen</b></font>)</div><p/>The tears stood in the honest workmen's eyes. They took the money with
heartfelt thanks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your nation we are bound to thank and bless, good father, if we
but knew it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My nation is the Church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement was then for bidding them farewell, but the honest fellows
implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) to wait a little; they had no silver nor gold, but they had
something they could give their benefactor, They took the press out of
the cart, and while Clement fed the mule, they hustled about, now on the
white hot road, now in the deep cool shade, now half in and half out,
and presently printed a quarto sheet of eight pages, which was already
set up. They had not type enough to print two sheets at a time. When,
after the slower preliminaries, the printed sheet was pulled all in a
moment, Clement was amazed in turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, are all these words really fast upon the paper?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Is it
verily certain they will not go as swiftly as they came? And you took
me for a magician! `Tis `Augustine de civitate Dei.' My sons, you carry
here the very wings of knowledge. Oh, never abuse this great craft!
Print no ill books! They would fly abroad countless as locusts, and lay
waste men's souls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The workmen</b></font>)</div><p/>The workmen said they would sooner put their hands under the screw than
so abuse their goodly craft.

<p/>And so they parted.

<p/>There is nothing but meeting and parting in this world.

<p/>At a town in Tuscany the holy friar had a sudden and strange recontre
with the past. He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) fell in with one of those motley assemblages of
patricians and plebeians, piety and profligacy, <div class="bookquote">``a company of pilgrims;''
 (<font color='red'><b>plebeians</b></font>)</div>a subject too well painted by others for me to go and daub.

<p/>They were in an immense barn belonging to the inn, Clement, dusty and
wearied, and no lover of idle gossip, sat in a corner studying the
Englishman's hours, and making them out as much by his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) own Dutch as by
the Latin version.

<p/>Presently a servant brought a bucket half full of water, and put it down
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) feet. A female servant followed with two towels. And then a woman
came forward, and crossing herself, kneeled down without a word at the
bucket-side, removed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sleeves entirely, and motioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) to put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) feet into the water. It was some lady of rank doing penance. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
wore a mask scarce an inch broad, but effectual. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) handled
the friar's feet more delicately than those do who are born to such
offices.

<p/>These penances were not uncommon; and Clement, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had little
faith in this form of contrition, received the services of the incognita
as a matter of course. But presently she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sighed deeply, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
heartfelt sigh and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head bent low over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) menial office, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed
so bowed with penitence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and said calmly but gently,
<div class="bookquote">``Can I aught for your soul's weal, my daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head with a faint sob. <div class="bookquote">``Nought, holy father, nought; only
to hear the sin of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) who is most unworthy to touch thy holy feet. `Tis
part of my penance to tell sinless men how vile I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak, my daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, bending lower and lower, <div class="bookquote">``these hands of mine
look white, but they are stained with blood--the blood of the man I
loved. Alas! you withdraw your foot. Ah me! What shall I do? All holy
things shrink from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Culpa mea! culpa mea!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``My daughter, it was an
unworthy movement of earthly weakness, for which I shall do penance.
Judge not the Church by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) feebler servants, Not her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) foot, but her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
bosom, is offered to thee, repenting truly. Take courage, then, and
purge thy conscience of its load.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>On this the lady, in a trembling whisper, and hurriedly, and cringing a
little, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feared the Church would strike her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bodily for what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had done, made this confession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was a stranger, and base-born, but beautiful as Spring, and wise
beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) years. I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>), I had not the prudence to conceal my
love. Nobles courted me. I ne’er thought one of humble birth could
reject me. I showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) my heart oh, shame of my sex! He (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) drew back; yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) admired me; but innocently, He (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) loved another; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) was constant. I
resorted to a woman's wiles, They availed not. I borrowed the wickedness
of men, and threatened his (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) life, and to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) true lover he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) died
false to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), Ah! you shrink your foot trembles. Am I not a monster?
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) wept and prayed to me for mercy; then my good angel helped me; I
bade him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) leave Rome. Gerard, Gerard, why did you not obey me? I thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was gone. But two months after this I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), Never shall I forget
it. I was descending the Tiber in my galley, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came up it with a
gay company, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) side a woman beautiful as an angel, but bold and
bad. That woman claimed me aloud for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rival. Traitor and hypocrite,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) had exposed me to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and to all the loose tongues in Rome. In
terror and revenge I hired-a bravo. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) was gone on his (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) bloody
errand, I wavered too late. The dagger I had hired struck, He (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) never came
back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) lodgings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) was dead. Alas! perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) was not so much to
blame: none have ever cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) name in my teeth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) poor body is not
found: or I should kiss its wounds; and slay myself upon it. All around
his (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) very name seems silent as the grave, to which this murderous hand
hath sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Clement's eye was drawn by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) movement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) recognized
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shapely arm, and soft white hand.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``And oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) was so young to die.
A poor thoughtless boy, that had fallen a victim to that bad woman's
arts, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) everything. Monster of cruelty, what
penance can avail me? Oh, holy father, what shall I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement's lips moved in prayer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) could not see his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
duty clear.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) feet and began to dry them. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) foot
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) soft arm, and pressed it with the towel so gently she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed
incapable of hurting a fly. Yet her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips had just told another story,
and a true one.

<p/>While Clement was still praying for wisdom, a tear fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) foot.
It decided him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I myself have been a great
sinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I; quite as great a sinner as thou; though not in the same way. The
devil has gins and snares, as well as traps. But penitence softened my
impious heart, and then gratitude remoulded it. Therefore, seeing you
penitent, I hope you can be grateful to Him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), who has been more merciful
to you than you have to your fellow-creature. Daughter, the Church sends
you comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Comfort to me? ah! never! unless it can raise my victim from the dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take this crucifix in thy hand, fix thine eyes on it, and listen to
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was all the reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father; but let me thoroughly dry your feet first; `tis ill
sitting in wet feet; and you are the holiest man of all whose feet I
have washed. I know it by your voice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Woman, I am not. As for my feet, they can wait their turn. Obey thou
me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady humbly. But with a woman's evasive
pertinacity she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wreathed one towel swiftly round the foot she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
drying, and placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) other foot on the dry napkin; then obeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
command.

<p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bowed over the crucifix, the low, solemn tones of the friar
fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ear, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) words soon made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whole body quiver with
various emotion, in quick succession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) you murdered--in intent--was one Gerard, a Hollander.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hollander</b></font>) loved a creature, as men should love none but their Redeemer and His (<font color='blue'><b>Hollander</b></font>)
Church. Heaven chastised him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollander</b></font>). A letter came to Rome. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Gerard! Poor Margaret!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>moaned the penitent.

<p/>Clement's voice faltered at this a moment. But soon, by a strong effort,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) recovered all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) calmness.

<p/>``His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feeble nature yielded, body and soul, to the blow, He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was stricken
down with fever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) revived only to rebel against Heaven. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said,
`There is no God.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Gerard? thou feeble, foolish woman! Nay, wicked, impious Gerard.

said to thee I know not; but be sure neither he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), nor any layman, knows
thy folly, This Gerard, rebel against Heaven, was no traitor to thee,

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady moaned like one in bodily agony, and the crucifix began to
tremble in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) trembling hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement. <div class="bookquote">``Comfort is at hand.''

<p/>CHAPTER LXXV

<p/>Clement sighed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) began to doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had taken the wisest course
with a creature so passionate.

<p/>But young as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had already learned many lessons of
ecclesiastical wisdom. For one thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had been taught to pause, ie.,
in certain difficulties, neither to do nor to say anything, until the
matter should clear itself a little.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) therefore held his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) peace and prayed for wisdom.

<p/>All he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) did was gently to withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) foot.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) penitent flung her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms round it with a piteous cry, and held it
convulsively, and wept over it.

<p/>And now the agony of shame, as well as penitence, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in, showed
itself by the bright red that crept over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very throat, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lay
quivering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement gently, <div class="bookquote">``take courage. Torment thyself no
more about this Gerard, who is not. As for me, I am Brother Clement,
whom Heaven hath sent to thee this day to comfort thee, and help thee
save thy soul. Thou last made me thy confessor, I claim, then, thine
obedience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sobbed the penitent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave this pilgrimage, and instant return to Rome. Penitence abroad is
little worth. There where we live lie the temptations we must defeat, or
perish; not fly in search of others more showy, but less lethal. Easy to
wash the feet of strangers, masked ourselves, Hard to be merely meek and
charitable with those about us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll never, never lay finger on her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I speak not of servants only, but of dependents, kinsmen, friends.
This be thy penance; the last thing at night, and the first thing after
matins, call to mind thy sin, and God His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) goodness; and so be humble and
gentle to the faults of those around thee. The world it courts the rich;
but seek thou the poor: not beggars; these for the most are neither
honest nor truly poor. But rather find out those who blush to seek thee,
yet need thee sore. Giving to them shalt lend to Heaven. Marry a good
son of the Church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me? I will never marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou wilt marry within the year. I do entreat and command thee to marry
one that feareth God. For thou art very clay. Mated ill thou shalt be
naught. But wedding a worthy husband thou mayest, Dei gratia, live a
pious princess; ay, and die a saint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) then desired her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to rise and go about the good work he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knees, and removing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mask, cast an eloquent look upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), then lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes meekly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will obey you as I would an angel. How happy I am, yet unhappy; for
oh, my heart tells me I shall never look on you again. I will not go
till I have dried your feet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It needs not. I have excused thee this bootless penance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis no penance to me. Ah! you do not forgive me, if you will not let
me dry your poor feet.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement resignedly; and thought to himself,
<div class="bookquote">``Levius quid foemina.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>But these weak creatures, that gravitate towards the small, as heavenly
bodies towards the great, have yet their own flashes of angelic
intelligence.

<p/>When the princess had dried the friar's feet, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) with
tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) beautiful eyes, and murmured with singular tenderness and
goodness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will have masses said for her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) soul. May I?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) added timidly.

<p/>This brought a faint blush into the monk's cheek, and moistened his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) cold
blue eye. It came so suddenly from one he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) was just rating so low.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a gracious thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Do as thou wilt: often such acts
fall back on the doer like blessed dew. I am thy confessor, not hers;
thine is the soul I must now do my all to save, or woe be to my own. My
daughter, my dear daughter, I see good and ill angels fighting for thy
soul this day, ay, this moment; oh, fight thou on thine own side. Dost
thou remember all I bade thee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember!''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess. <div class="bookquote">``Sweet saint, each syllable of thine is
graved in my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But one word more, then. Pray much to Christ, and little to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
saints.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that is the best word I have light to say to thee. So part we on
it. Thou to the place becomes thee best, thy father's house, I to my
holy mother's work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Adieu,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>faltered the princess. <div class="bookquote">``Adieu, thou that I have loved too well,
hated too ill, known and revered too late; forgiving angel, adieu--for
ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The monk</b></font>)</div><p/>The monk caught her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) words, though but faltered in a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For ever?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) cried aloud, with sudden ardour. <div class="bookquote">``Christians live `for
ever,' and love `for ever,' but they never part `for ever. They part, as
part the earth and sun, to meet more brightly in a little while. You and
I part here for life. And what is our life? One line in the great story
of the Church, whose son and daughter we are; one handful in the sand of
time, one drop in the ocean of `For ever.' Adieu--for the little moment
called `a life!' We part in trouble, we shall meet in peace: we part
creatures of clay, we shall meet immortal spirits: we part in a world of
sin and sorrow, we shall meet where all is purity and love divine; where
no ill passions are, but Christ is, and His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) saints around Him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) clad in
white. There, in the turning of an hour-glass, in the breaking of a
bubble, in the passing of a cloud, she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), and thou, and I, shall meet
again; and sit at the feet of angels and archangels, apostles and
saints, and beam like them with joy unspeakable, in the light of the
shadow of God upon His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) throne, FOR EVER--AND EVER--AND EVER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And so they parted. The monk erect, his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) eyes turned heavenwards and
glowing with the sacred fire of zeal; the princess slowly retiring and
turning more than once to cast a lingering glance of awe and tender
regret on that inspired figure.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) went home subdued, and purified. Clement, in due course, reached
Basle, and entered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) duties, teaching in the University, and
preaching in the town and neighbourhood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) led a life that can be
comprised in two words; deep study, and mortification. My reader has
already a peep into his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) soul. At Basle he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) advanced in holy zeal and
knowledge.

<p/>The brethren of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) order began to see in him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) a descendant of the saints
and martyrs.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXVI

<p/>THE HEARTH

<p/>When little Gerard was nearly three months old, a messenger came hot
from Tergou for Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now just you go back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and tell them I can't come, and I
won't: they have got Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) departed, and Catherine continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
sentence; <div class="bookquote">``there, child, I must go: they are all at sixes and sevens:
this is the third time of asking; and to-morrow my man would come
himself and take me home by the ear, with a flea in't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) then
recapitulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) experiences of infants, and instructed Margaret what
to do in each coming emergency, and pressed money upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), Margaret
declined it with thanks, Catherine insisted, and turned angry. Margaret
made excuses all so reasonable that Catherine rejected them with calm
contempt; to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind they lacked femininity,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, out with your heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``and you and me parting; and
mayhap shall never see one another's face again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! mother, say not so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack, girl, I have seen it so often; `twill come into my mind now at
each parting, When I was your age, I never had such a thought, Nay, we
were all to live for ever then: so out wi' it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, then, mother--I would rather not have told you--your Cornelis
must say to me, `So you are come to share with us, eh, mistress?' those
were his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) words, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) I would be very sorry.

<p/>``Beshrew his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) ill tongue! What signifies it? He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) will never know,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most likely he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) would sooner or later, But whether or no, I will take
no grudged bounty from any family; unless I saw my child starving,
and--Heaven only knows what I might do, Nay, mother, give me but thy
love--I do prize that above silver, and they grudge me not that, by all
I can find--for not a stiver of money will I take out of your house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a foolish lass, Why, were it me, I'd take it just to spite
him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you would not, You and I are apples off one tree''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine yielded with a good grace; and when the actual parting came,
embraces and tears burst forth on both sides.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was gone the child cried a good deal; and all attempts to
pacify him (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) failing, Margaret suspected a pin, and searching between his (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
clothes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) skin, found a gold angel incommoding his (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) backbone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, now, Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to the babe; <div class="bookquote">``I thought granny gave in
rather sudden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the babe</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took the coin and wrapped it in a piece of linen, and laid it at the
bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) box, bidding the infant observe she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could be at times as
resolute as granny herself.

<p/>Catherine told Eli of Margaret's foolish pride, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had baffled
it. Eli said Margaret was right, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was wrong.

<p/>Catherine tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head. Eli pondered.

<p/>Margaret was not without domestic anxieties. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had still two men to
feed, and could not work so hard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had enough to do
to keep the house, and the child, and cook for them all. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had a
little money laid by, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) used to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) child his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) father would be
home to help them before it was spent. And with these bright hopes, and
that treasury of bliss, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) spent some happy months.

<p/>Time wore on; and no Gerard came; and stranger still, no news of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind was disquieted, and contrary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) nature, which was
practical, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was often lost in sad reverie; and sighed in silence. And
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heart was troubled, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) money was melting. And so it was,
that one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found the cupboard empty, and looked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dependents'
faces; and at the sight of them, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bosom was all pity; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
appealed to the baby whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could let grandfather and poor old
Martin want a meal; and went and took out Catherine's angel. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
unfolded the linen a tear of gentle mortification fell on it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sent
Martin out to change it. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was gone a Frenchman came with one of
the dealers in illuminated work, who had offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) so poor a price.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was employed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sovereign to collect masterpieces for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) book of hours. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) the two best things she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was charmed with one of them, viz., the flowers and raspberries and
creeping things, which Margaret Van Eyck had shaded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) an
unheard-of price. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, flout not my need, good stranger,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>);
<div class="bookquote">``three mouths there be in this house, and none to fill them but me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Curious arithmetic! Left out No. 1.

<p/>``I'd out thee not, fair mistress. My princess charged me strictly, `Seek
the best craftsmen'; but I will no hard bargains; make them content with
me, and me with them.'''

<p/>The next minute Margaret was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knees kissing little Gerard in
the cradle, and showering four gold pieces on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) again and again, and
relating the whole occurrence to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in very broken Dutch,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And oh, what a good princess: wasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)? We will pray for her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), won't
we, my lambkin; when we are old enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dutch</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin came in furious. <div class="bookquote">``They will not change it. I trow they think I
stole it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am beholden to thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret hastily, and almost snatched
it from Martin, and wrapped it up again, and restored it to its
hiding-place.

<p/>Ere these unexpected funds were spent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) got to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ironing and
starching again. In the midst of which Martin sickened; and died after
an illness of nine days.

<p/>Nearly all her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) money went to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) decently.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was gone; and there was an empty chair by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fireside, For he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had
preferred the hearth to the sun as soon as the Busy Body was gone.

<p/>Margaret would not allow anybody to sit in this chair now. Yet whenever
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eye dwell too long on it vacant, it was sure to cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) a
tear.

<p/>And now there was nobody to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) linen home, To do it herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
must leave little Gerard in charge of a neighbour, But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dared not
trust such a treasure to mortal; and besides she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sight for hours and hours. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) set inquiries on foot for a boy
to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) basket on Saturday and Monday.

<p/>A plump, fresh-coloured youth, called Luke Peterson, who looked fifteen,
but was eighteen, came in, and blushing, and twiddling his (<font color='blue'><b>Peterson</b></font>) bonnet, asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) if a man would not serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turn as well as a boy.

<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was saying to herself, <div class="bookquote">``This boy will just do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took the cue, and said, ``Nay; but a man will maybe seek more
than I can well pay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke warmly. <div class="bookquote">``Why, Mistress Margaret, I am your neighbour,
and I do very well at the coopering. I can carry your basket for you
before or after my day's work, and welcome, You have no need to pay me
anything. `Tisn't as if we were strangers, ye know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Master Luke, I know your face, for that matter; but I cannot call
to mind that ever a word passed between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, you did, Mistress Margaret. What, have you forgotten? One day
you were trying to carry your baby and eke your pitcher full o' water;
and quo' I, `Give me the baby to carry.' `Nay, says you, `I'll give you
the pitcher, and keep the bairn myself;' and I carried the pitcher home,
and you took it from me at this door, and you said to me, `I am muckle
obliged to you, young man,' with such a sweet voice; not like the folk
in this street speak to a body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do mind now, Master Luke; and methinks it was the least I could say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mistress Margaret, if you will say as much every time I carry
your basket, I care not how often I bear it, nor how far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, colouring faintly. <div class="bookquote">``I would not put upon
good nature, You are young, Master Luke, and kindly. Say I give you
your supper on Saturday night, when you bring the linen home, and your
dawn-mete o' Monday; would that make us anyways even?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you please; only say not I sought a couple o' diets! for such a
trifle as yon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>With chubby-faced Luke's timely assistance, and the health and strength
which Heaven gave this poor young woman, to balance her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) many ills, the
house went pretty smoothly awhile. But the heart became more and more
troubled by Gerard's long, and now most mysterious silence.

<p/>And then that mental torturer, Suspense, began to tear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heavy heart
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hot pincers, till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried often and vehemently, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, that I
could know the worst.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in this state, one day she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard a heavy step mount
the stair. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) started and trembled, <div class="bookquote">``That is no step that I know. Ill
tidings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>The door opened, and an unexpected visitor, Eli, came in, looking grave
and kind.

<p/>Margaret eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) in silence, and with increasing agitation,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the skipper is come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>gasped Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``is he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely I hope so. No one has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then they must have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, girl; neither dead nor alive hath he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) been seen this many months in
Rome. My daughter Kate thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) is gone to some other city. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) bade me
tell you her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) thought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, like enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret gloomily; <div class="bookquote">``like enough. My poor babe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man in a faintish voice asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) for a morsel to eat: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
come fasting.

<p/>The poor thing pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the surface of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) agitated mind, and
cooked a meal for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), trembling, and scarce knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was about.

<p/>Ere he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Be he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) alive, or
be he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) dead, I look on thee as my daughter. Can I do nought for thee this
day? bethink thee now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, old man. Pray for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli sighed, and went sadly and heavily down the stairs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) listened half stupidly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) retiring footsteps till they ceased.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sank moaning down by the cradle, and drew little Gerard tight
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bosom. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my poor fatherless boy; my fatherless boy!''



 (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXVII

<p/>Not long after this, as the little family at Tergou sat at dinner, Luke
Peterson burst in on them, covered with dust. <div class="bookquote">``Good people, Mistress
Catherine is wanted instantly at Rotterdam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Catherine, young man. Kate, it will be Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, dame, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said to me, `Good Luke, hie thee to Tergou, and ask for
Eli the hosier, and pray his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) wife Catherine to come to me, for God His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
love.' I didn't wait for daylight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Holy saints! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has come home, Kate. Nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would sure have said so.
What on earth can it be?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heaped conjecture on conjecture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mayhap the young man can tell us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>hazarded Kate timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, <div class="bookquote">``Why, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) babe is a-dying, And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was so
wrapped up in it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine started up: <div class="bookquote">``What is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trouble?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I know not. But it has been peaking and pining worse and worse
this while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cornelis</b></font>)</div><p/>A furtive glance of satisfaction passed between Cornelis and Sybrandt.
Luckily for them Catherine did not see it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face was turned towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Eli,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) furiously, ``if you say a word against
it, you and I shall quarrel, after all these years.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who gainsays thee, foolish woman? Quarrel with your own shadow, while I
go borrow Peter's mule for ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless thee, my good man! Bless thee! Didst never yet fail me at a
pinch, Now eat your dinners who can, while I go and make ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took Luke back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in the cart, and on the way questioned and
cross-questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) severely and seductively by turns, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) mind inside out, what there was of it.

<p/>Margaret met her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) at the door, pale and agitated, and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) neck, and looked imploringly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is alive, thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, after scanning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
eagerly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked at the failing child, and then at the poor hollow-eyed
mother, alternately, <div class="bookquote">``Lucky you sent for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``The child is
poisoned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poisoned! by whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By you. You have been fretting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, indeed, mother. How can I help fretting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me, Margaret. A nursing mother has no business to fret. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
must turn her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grief to the comfort that lies in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
lap. Know you not that the child pines if the mother vexes herself? This
comes of your reading and writing. Those idle crafts befit a man;
but they keep all useful knowledge out of a woman. The child must be
weaned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you cruel woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret vehemently; <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry I sent for
you. Would you rob me of the only bit of comfort I have in the world?
A-nursing my Gerard, I forget I am the most unhappy creature beneath the
sun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you do not,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the retort, <div class="bookquote">``or he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would not be the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret imploringly.

<p/>```Tis hard,'' replied Catherine, relenting. <div class="bookquote">``But bethink thee; would it
not be harder to look down and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lovely wee face a-looking up at
you out of a little coffin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jesu!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how could you face your other troubles with your heart aye full,
and your lap empty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, I consent to anything. Only save my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a good lass, Trust to me! I do stand by, and see clearer than
thou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the babe</b></font>)</div><p/>Unfortunately there was another consent to be gained--the babe's; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
was more refractory than his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, trying to affect regret at his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) misbehaviour; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
loves me too well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>But Catherine was a match for them both. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) came along she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
observed a healthy young woman, sitting outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own door, with an
infant, hard by. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) the case; and would she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nurse the
pining child for the nonce, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had matters ready to wean him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)?

<p/>The young woman consented with a smile, and popped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child into the
cradle, and came into Margaret's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dropped a curtsey, and
Catherine put the child into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) examined, and pitied it, and
purred over it, and proceeded to nurse it, just as if it had been her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
own.

<p/>Margaret, who had been paralyzed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) assurance, cast a rueful look at
Catherine, and burst out crying.

<p/>The visitor looked up. <div class="bookquote">``What is to do? Wife, ye told me not the mother
was unwilling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is not: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is only a fool. Never heed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and you, Margaret, I am
ashamed of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a cruel, hard-hearted woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>sobbed Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Them as take in hand to guide the weak need be hardish. And you will
excuse me; but you are not my flesh and blood; and your boy is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After giving this blunt speech time to sink, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Come now, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
is robbing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own to save yours, and you can think of nothing better
than bursting out a-blubbering in the woman's face. Out fie, for shame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse. <div class="bookquote">``Thank Heaven, I have enough for my own
and for hers to boot. And prithee wyte not on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)! Maybe the troubles o'
life ha' soured her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own milk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart into the bargain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said the remorseless Catherine.

<p/>Margaret looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) full in the face; and down went her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I ought to be very grateful to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>sobbed Margaret to the
nurse: then turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head and leaned away over the chair, not to
witness the intolerable sight of another nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) Gerard, and Gerard
drawing no distinction between this new mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) the banished one.

<p/>The nurse replied, <div class="bookquote">``You are very welcome, my poor woman. And so are you,
Mistress Catherine, which are my townswoman, and know it not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The nurse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, are ye from Tergou? all the better, But I cannot call your face
to mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you know not me: my husband and me, we are very humble folk by you.
But true Eli and his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) wife are known of all the town; and respected,
So, I am at your call, dame; and at yours, wife; and yours, my pretty
poppet; night or day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a woman of the right old sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, as the door
closed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I HATE her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I HATE her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I HATE her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, with wonderful
fervour.

<p/>Catherine only laughed at this outburst.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``better say it, as set sly and think it. It
is very natural after all, Come, here is your bundle o' comfort. Take
and hate that, if ye can;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) put the child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head half way from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could
not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) life turn the other half. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is not my child now; he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is
hers. I know not why she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) here, for my part. It was very good of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not to take him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) house, cradle and all; oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh
oh! oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! well, one comfort, he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is not dead. This gives me light: some other
woman has got him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) away from me; like father, like son; oh! oh! oh! oh!
oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine was sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cry in peace. And after that,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wanted Joan's aid, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) used to take Gerard out, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
a little fresh air. Margaret never objected; nor expressed the least
incredulity; but on their return was always in tears.

<p/>This connivance was short-lived. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was now altogether as eager to
wean little Gerard. It was done; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) recovered health and vigour; and
another trouble fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) directly teething, But here Catherine's
experience was invaluable; and now, in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) grief and
anxiety about the father, Margaret had moments of bliss, watching the
son's tiny teeth come through. <div class="bookquote">``Teeth, mother? I call them not teeth,
but pearls of pearls.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And each pearl that peeped and sparkled on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
red gums, was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) the greatest feat Nature had ever achieved.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) companion partook the illusion. And had we told them standing corn
was equally admirable, Margaret would have changed to a reproachful
gazelle, and Catherine turned us out of doors; so each pearl's arrival
was announced with a shriek of triumph by whichever of them was the
fortunate discoverer.

<p/>Catherine gossiped with Joan, and learned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was the wife of
Jorian Ketel of Tergou, who had been servant to Ghysbrecht Van Swieten,
but fallen out of favour, and come back to Rotterdam, his (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) native place.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) friends had got him (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) the place of sexton to the parish, and what with
that and carpentering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) did pretty well.

<p/>Catherine told Joan in return whose child it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had nursed, and all
about Margaret and Gerard, and the deep anxiety his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) silence had plunged
them in. <div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div>said Joan, <div class="bookquote">``the world is full of trouble.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div>One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>)
said to Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``It's my belief my man knows more about your Gerard
than anybody in these parts; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) has got to be closer than ever of
late. Drop in some day just afore sunset, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) talking. And for
our Lady's sake say not I set you on. The only hiding he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ever gave me
was for babbling his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) business; and I do not want another. Gramercy! I
married a man for the comfort of the thing, not to be hided.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine dropped in. Jorian was ready enough to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had
befriended her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) son and perhaps saved his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) life. But this was no news to
Catherine; and the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began to cross-question him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) as to whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could guess why her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lost boy neither came nor wrote, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cast a grim
look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wife, who received it with a calm air of stolid candour and
innocent unconsciousness; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) answers became short and sullen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know more than another?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and so on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) added, after a
pause, <div class="bookquote">``Think you the burgomaster takes such as me into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) secrets?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, then the burgomaster knows something?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Likely. Who else should?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) you say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is right, dame. Go make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mine enemy. That is what a poor fellow
always gets if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) says a word to you women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>And Jorian from that moment shrunk in and became impenetrable as a
hedgehog, and almost as prickly.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) conduct caused both the poor women agonies of mind, alarm, and
irritated curiosity. Ghysbrecht was for some cause Gerard's mortal
enemy; had stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) marriage, imprisoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>), hunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>). And here
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) late servant, who when off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) guard had hinted that this enemy
had the clue to Gerard's silence. After sifting Jorian's every word and
look, all remained dark and mysterious. Then Catherine told Margaret to
go herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are young, you are fair. You will maybe get more
out of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) than I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conjecture was a reasonable one.

<p/>Margaret went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms and tapped timidly at Jorian's
door just before sunset. <div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said a sturdy voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) entered,
and there sat Jorian by the fireside. At sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rose, snorted,
and burst out of the house. <div class="bookquote">``Is that for me, wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>inquired Margaret,
turning very red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must excuse him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div>replied Joan, rather coldly; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lays it to your
door that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is a poor man instead of a rich one. It is something about
a piece of parchment, There was one amissing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) got nought from the
burgomaster all along of that one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! Gerard took it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Likely, But my man says you should not have let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): you were pledged
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to keep them all safe. And sooth to Say, I blame not my Jorian
for being wroth, `Tis hard for a poor man to be so near fortune and lose
it by those he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has befriended. However, I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) another story. Says
I, `Folk that are out o' trouble like you and me didn't ought to be too
hard on folk that are in trouble; and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has plenty. Going already?
What is all your hurry, mistress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it is not for me to drive the goodman out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let me kiss the bairn afore ye go. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not in fault anyway,
poor innocent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon this cruel rebuff Margaret came to a resolution, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not
confide even to Catherine.

<p/>After six weeks' stay that good woman returned home.

<p/>On the child's birthday, which occurred soon after, Margaret did no
work; but put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) Sunday clothes, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms and
went to the church and prayed there long and fervently for Gerard's safe
return.

<p/>That same day and hour Father Clement celebrated a mass and prayed for
Margaret's departed soul in the minster church at Basle.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXVIII

<p/>Some blackguard or other, I think it was Sybrandt, said, <div class="bookquote">``A lie is not
like a blow with a curtal axe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div><p/>True: for we can predict in some degree the consequences of a stroke
with any material weapon. But a lie has no bounds at all. The nature of
the thing is to ramify beyond human calculation.

<p/>Often in the everyday world a lie has cost a life, or laid waste two or
three.

<p/>And so, in this story, what tremendous consequences of that one
heartless falsehood!

<p/>Yet the tellers reaped little from it.

<p/>The brothers, who invented it merely to have one claimant the less for
their father's property, saw little Gerard take their brother's place
in their mother's heart. Nay, more, one day Eli openly proclaimed that,
Gerard being lost, and probably dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had provided by will for little
Gerard, and also for Margaret, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) poor son's widow.

<p/>At this the look that passed between the black sheep was a caution to
traitors. Cornelis had it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) lips to say. Gerard was most likely
alive, But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mother looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and checked himself in
time.

<p/>Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, the other partner in that lie, was now a failing
man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the period fast approaching when all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wealth would drop
from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misdeeds cling to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul.

<p/>Too intelligent to deceive himself entirely, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been free
from gusts of remorse. In taking Gerard's letter to Margaret he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had
compounded. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot give up land and money,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) giant Avarice.
<div class="bookquote">``I will cause her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) no unnecessary pain,''  (<font color='red'><b>dwarf</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dwarf Conscience.

<p/>So, after first tampering with the seal, and finding there was not a
syllable about the deed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own hand; and made a
merit of it to himself: a set-off; and on a scale not uncommon where the
self-accuser is the judge.

<p/>The birth of Margaret's child surprised and shocked him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), and put his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
treacherous act in a new light. Should his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) letter take effect he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) should
cause the dishonour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) who was the daughter of one friend, the
granddaughter of another, and whose land he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was keeping from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) too.

<p/>These thoughts preying on him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) at that period of life when the strength
of body decays, and the memory of old friends revives, filled him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) with
gloomy horrors. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was afraid to confess. For the cure was an honest
man, and would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disgorge. And with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Avarice was an
ingrained habit, Penitence only a sentiment.

<p/>Matters were thus when, one day, returning from the town hall to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
house, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found a woman waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the vestibule, with a child
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was veiled, and so, concluding she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had something to
be ashamed of, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) magisterially, On this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) let down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
veil and looked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) full in the face.

<p/>It was Margaret Brandt.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sudden appearance and manner startled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not conceal
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is my Gerard?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom heaving. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For aught I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>stammered Ghysbrecht. <div class="bookquote">``I hope so, for your sake.
Prithee come into this room. The servants!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a step,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the shoulder, and held
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with all the energy of an excited woman. <div class="bookquote">``You know the secret of
that which is breaking my heart. Why does not my Gerard come, nor send
a line this many months? Answer me, or all the town is like to hear me,
let alone thy servants, My misery is too great to be sported with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In vain he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) persisted he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew nothing about Gerard. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) those
who had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) another tale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) neither comes nor sends,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) firmly.

<p/>At this Ghysbrecht turned paler and paler; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) summoned all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
dignity, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Would you believe those two knaves against a man of
worship?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What two knaves?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) keenly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stammered, <div class="bookquote">``Said ye not--? There I am a poor old broken man, whose
memory is shaken. And you come here, and confuse me so, I know not what
I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sir, your memory is shaken, or sure you would not be my enemy. My
father saved you from the plague, when none other would come anigh you;
and was ever your friend. My grandfather Floris helped you in your early

seen; and here is the fourth of us; this is your old friend Peter's
grandchild, and your old friend Floris his (<font color='blue'><b>Floris</b></font>) great-grandchild. Look down

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Woman, you torture me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>sighed Ghysbrecht, and sank upon a bench. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) advantage, and kneeled before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and put the boy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
knees. <div class="bookquote">``This fatherless babe is poor Margaret Brandt's, that never did

a poor desolate girl and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) babe have done to wipe out all memory of

up in thy face and implores thee to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Floris</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>Floris</b></font>) father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>And with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms under the child she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) up higher and higher,
smiling under the old man's eyes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cast a wild look of anguish on the child, and another on the kneeling
mother, and started up shrieking, <div class="bookquote">``Avaunt, ye pair of adders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The stung soul gave the old limbs a momentary vigour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked
rapidly, wringing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and clutching at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) white hair. <div class="bookquote">``Forget
those days? I forget all else. Oh, woman, woman, sleeping or waking I
see but the faces of the dead, I hear but the voices of the dead, and I
shall soon be among the dead, There, there, what is done is done. I am
in hell. I am in hell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And unnatural force ended in prostration.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) staggered, and but for Margaret would have fallen, With her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) one
disengaged arm she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) supported him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could and cried for
help.

<p/>A couple of servants came running, and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away in a state
bordering on syncope, The last Margaret saw of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old furrowed
face, white and helpless as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair that hung down over the servant's
elbow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I doubt I have killed the poor old man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then this attempt to penetrate the torturing mystery left it as dark,
or darker than before. For when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came to ponder every word, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
suspicion was confirmed that Ghysbrecht did know something about Gerard.
<div class="bookquote">``And who were the two knaves he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought had done a good deed, and told
me? Oh, my Gerard, my poor deserted babe, you and I are wading in deep
waters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tergou</b></font>)</div><p/>The visit to Tergou took more money than she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could well afford; and a
customer ran away in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) debt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was once more compelled to unfold
Catherine's angel. But strange to say, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came down stairs with it
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found some loose silver on the table, with a written
line--

<p/>For Gerard his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wife.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fell with a cry of surprise on the writing; and soon it rose into a
cry of joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is alive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sends me this by some friendly hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kissed the writing again and again, and put it in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bosom.

<p/>Time rolled on, and no news of Gerard.

<p/>And about every two months a small sum in silver found its way into the
house. Sometimes it lay on the table. Once it was flung in through the
bedroom window in a purse. Once it was at the bottom of Luke's basket.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) had stopped at the public-house to talk to a friend. The giver or his (<font color='blue'><b>giver</b></font>)
agent was never detected. Catherine disowned it. Margaret Van Eyck swore
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) had no hand in it. So did Eli. And Margaret, whenever it came, used
to say to little Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my poor deserted child, you and I are
wading in deep waters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) applied at least half this modest, but useful supply, to dressing
the little Gerard beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) station in life. <div class="bookquote">``If it does come from
Gerard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) shall see his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) boy neat.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mothers</b></font>)</div>All the mothers in the street began
to sneer, especially such as had brats out at elbows.

<p/>The months rolled on, and dead sickness of heart succeeded to these
keener torments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) first thought: <div class="bookquote">``Gerard must be
dead. She (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) should never see her (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) boy's father again, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) marriage
lines.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>This last grief, which had been somewhat allayed by Eli and
Catherine recognizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) betrothal, now revived in full force; others
would not look so favourably on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) story. And often she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) moaned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
boy's illegitimacy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not enough for us to be bereaved? Must we be dishonoured too? Oh,
that we had ne’er been born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter Brandt</b></font>)</div><p/>A change took place in Peter Brandt. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) mind, clouded for nearly two
years, seemed now to be clearing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) had intervals of intelligence; and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) and Margaret used to talk of Gerard, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wandered again. But
one day, returning after an absence of some hours, Margaret found
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) conversing with Catherine, in a way he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had never done since his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
paralytic stroke. <div class="bookquote">``Eh, girl, why must you be out?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But
indeed I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) all; and we have been a-crying together over thy
troubles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret stood silent, looking joyfully from one to the other.

<p/>Peter smiled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``Come, let me bless thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) kneeled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) feet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) most eloquently.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had been all her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) life the lovingest, truest, and most
obedient daughter Heaven ever sent to a poor old widowed man. <div class="bookquote">``May thy
son be to thee what thou hast been to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dozed. Then the females whispered together; and Catherine
said--<div class="bookquote">``All our talk e'en now was of Gerard. It lies heavy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mind.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) poor head must often have listened to us when it seemed quite dark.
Margaret, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is a very understanding man; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought of many things: `He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
may be in prison, says he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), `or forced to go fighting for some king,
or sent to Constantinople to copy books there, or gone into the Church
after all.' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had a bent that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>whispered Margaret, in reply, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) doth but deceive himself
as we do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could finish the sentence, a strange interruption occurred.

<p/>A loud voice cried out, <div class="bookquote">``I SEE HIM, I SEE HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>And the old man with dilating eyes seemed to be looking right through
the wall of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``IN A BOAT; ON A GREAT RIVER; COMING THIS WAY. Sore disfigured; but I
knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Gone! gone! all dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sank back, and asked feebly where was Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear father, I am by thy side, Oh, mother! mother, what is this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot see thee, and but a moment agone I saw all round the world,
Ay, ay. Well, I am ready. Is this thy hand? Bless thee, my child, bless
thee! Weep not! The tree is ripe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The physician</b></font>)</div><p/>The old physician read the signs aright. These calm words were his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) last.
The next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) drooped his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) head, and gently, placidly, drifted away
from earth, like an infant sinking to rest, The torch had flashed up
before going out.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXIX

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) who had wept for poor old Martin was not likely to bear this blow so
stoically as the death of the old is apt to be borne. In vain Catherine
tried to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with commonplaces; in vain told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) it was a happy
release for him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); and that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) himself had said, the tree was ripe.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) worst failure was, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) urged that there were now but two
mouths to feed; and one care the less.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such cares are all the joys I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``They fill my
desolate heart, which now seems void as well as waste. Oh, empty chair,
my bosom it aches to see thee. Poor old man, how could I love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by
halves, I that did use to sit and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and think, `But for me
thou wouldst die of hunger.' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so wise, so learned erst, was got to
be helpless as my own sweet babe, and I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been
my child instead of my father. Oh, empty chair! Oh, empty heart!
Well-a-day! well-a-day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And the pious tears would not be denied.

<p/>Then Catherine held her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) peace; and hung her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head. And one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made
this confession, <div class="bookquote">``I speak to thee out o' my head, and not out o' my
bosom; thou dost well to be deaf to me. Were I in thy place I should
mourn the old man all one as thou dost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Margaret embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and this bit of true sympathy did her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) a
little good. The commonplaces did none.

<p/>Then Catherine's bowels yearned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``My poor girl,
you were not born to live alone. I have got to look on you as my own
daughter. Waste not thine youth upon my son Gerard. Either he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is dead or
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is a traitor. It cuts my heart to say it; but who can help seeing it?
Thy father is gone; and I cannot always be aside thee. And here is
an honest lad that loves thee well this many a day. I'd take him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) and
Comfort together. Heaven hath sent us these creatures to torment us and
comfort us and all; we are just nothing in the world without `em,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then
seeing Margaret look utterly perplexed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``Why, sure
you are not so blind as not to see it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who but this Luke Peterson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, our Luke? The boy that carries my basket?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) is over nineteen, and a fine healthy lad; and I have made
inquiries for you; and they all do say he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) is a capable workman, and
never touches a drop; and that is much in a Rotterdam lad, which they
are mostly half man, half sponge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret smiled for the first time this many days. <div class="bookquote">``Luke loves dried
puddings dearly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I make them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) mind, `Tis them he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
comes a-courting here.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) suddenly turned red. <div class="bookquote">``But if I thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) came after your son's wife that is, or ought to be, I'd soon put him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
to the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay; for Heaven's sake let me not make mischief. Poor lad! Why,
girl, Fancy will not be bridled, Bless you, I wormed it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) near
a twelvemonth agone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, and you let him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I thought of you. I said to myself, `If he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is fool enough to
be her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) slave for nothing, all the better for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). A lone woman is lost
without a man about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to fetch and carry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little matters,' But now
my mind is changed, and I think the best use you can put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to is to
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So then, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own mother is against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and would wed me to the first

 (<font color='red'><b>the busybody</b></font>)</div><p/>Afflicted with the busybody's protection, Luke Peterson met a cold
reception in the house where he (<font color='blue'><b>Peterson</b></font>) had hitherto found a gentle and kind
one. And by-and-by, finding himself very little spoken to at all, and
then sharply and irritably, the great soft fellow fell to whimpering,
and asked Margaret plump if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had done anything to offend her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. I am to blame. I am curst. If you will take my counsel you
will keep out of my way awhile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all along of me, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>the busybody</b></font>)</div>said the busybody.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, Mistress Catherine, Why, what have I done for you to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
against me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I meant all for the best. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) I saw you were looking
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) through a wedding ring, But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) won't hear of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was no need to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that, wife; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knows I am courting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
this twelvemonth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret; ``or I should never have opened the street door
to you.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I come here every Saturday night. And that is how the lads in
Rotterdam do court. If we sup with a lass o' Saturdays, that wooing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that is Rotterdam, is it? Then next time you come, let it be
Thursday or Friday. For my part, I thought you came after my puddings,
boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like your puddings well enough. You make them better than mother
does, But I like you still better than the puddings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke
tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you have seen the last of them. How dare you talk so to another
man's wife, and him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) far away?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ended gently, but very firmly, <div class="bookquote">``You

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke; and after sitting silent and stupid for a
little while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) rose, and said sadly to Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``Dame, I daresay I
have got the sack;''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>and went out.

<p/>But the next Saturday Catherine found him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) seated on the doorstep
blubbering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) had got used to come there, and every other
place seemed strange. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went in, and told Margaret; and Margaret
sighed, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Poor Luke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) might come in for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) could
know his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) place, and treat her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) like a married wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>On this being
communicated to Luke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) hesitated, <div class="bookquote">``Pshaw!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``promises
are pie-crusts. Promise her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) all the world, sooner than sit outside

everything, and then, if Poor Gerard come not home and claim her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), you
will be sure to have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--in time. A lone woman is aye to be tired out,

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXX

<p/>THE CLOISTER

<p/>Brother Clement had taught and preached in Basle more than a
twelvemonth, when one day Jerome stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>), dusty, with a
triumphant glance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give the glory to God, Brother Clement; thou canst now wend to England
with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ready, Brother Jerome; and expecting thee these many months, have
in the intervals of teaching and devotion studied the English tongue
somewhat closely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Twas well thought of,'' said Jerome. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) then told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) had but
delayed till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) could obtain extraordinary powers from the Pope to
collect money for the Church's use in England, and to hear confession
in all the secular monasteries. <div class="bookquote">``So now gird up thy loins, and let us go
forth and deal a good blow for the Church, and against the Franciscans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The friars</b></font>)</div><p/>The two friars went preaching down the Rhine for England. In the larger
places they both preached. At the smaller they often divided, and took
different sides of the river, and met again at some appointed spot. Both
were able orators, but in different styles.

<p/>Jerome's was noble and impressive, but a little contracted in religious
topics, and a trifle monotonous in delivery compared with Clement's,
though in truth not so, compared with most preachers.

<p/>Clement's was full of variety, and often remarkably colloquial. In its
general flow, tender and gently winning, it curled round the reason and
the heart. But it always rose with the rising thought; and so at times
Clement soared as far above Jerome as his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) level speaking was below him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>).
Indeed, in these noble heats he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was all that we hue read of inspired
prophet or heathen orator: Vehemens ut procella, excitatus ut torrens,
incensus ut fulmen, tonabat, fulgurabat, et rapidis eloquentiae
fiuctibus cuncta proruebat et perturbabat.

<p/>I would give literal specimens, but for five objections; it is
difficult; time is short; I have done it elsewhere; an able imitator
has since done it better and similarity, a virtue in peas, is a vice in
books.

<p/>But -LRB-not to evade the matter entirely-RRB- Clement used secretly to try and
learn the recent events and the besetting sin of each town he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was to
preach in.

<p/>But Jerome, the unbending, scorned to go out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) way for any people's
vices. At one great town, some leagues from the Rhine, they mounted
the same pulpit in turn. Jerome preached against vanity in dress, a
favourite theme of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) was eloquent and satirical, and the people
listened with complacency. It was a vice that they were little given to.

<p/>Clement preached against drunkenness. It was a besetting sin, and sacred
from preaching in these parts: for the clergy themselves were infected
with it, and popular prejudice protected it, Clement dealt it merciless
blows out of Holy Writ and worldly experience. A crime itself, it was
the nursing mother of most crimes, especially theft and murder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
reminded them of a parricide that had lately been committed in their
town by all honest man in liquor; and also how a band of drunkards had
roasted one of their own comrades alive at a neighbouring village. <div class="bookquote">``Your
last prince,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is reported to have died of apoplexy, but well
you know he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) died of drink; and of your aldermen one perished miserably
last month dead drunk, suffocated in a puddle. Your children's backs go
bare that you may fill your bellies with that which makes you the
worst of beasts, silly as calves, yet fierce as boars; and drives your
families to need, and your souls to hell. I tell ye your town, ay, and
your very nation, would sink to the bottom of mankind did your women
drink as you do. And how long will they be temperate, and contrary to
nature, resist the example of their husbands and fathers? Vice ne’er
yet stood still. Ye must amend yourselves, or see them come down to
your mark, Already in Bohemia they drink along with the men. How shows
a drunken woman? Would you love to see your wives drunken, your mothers
drunken?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At this there was a shout of horror, for mediaeval audiences
had not learned to sit mumchance at a moving sermon. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, that comes
home to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>cried the friar. <div class="bookquote">``What madmen! think you it doth not
more shock the all-pure God to see a man, His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) noblest work, turned to
a drunken beast, than it can shock you creatures of sin and unreason to
see a woman turned into a thing no better nor worse than yourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) ended with two pictures: a drunkard's house and family, and a sober
man's; both so true and dramatic in all their details that the wives
fell all to <div class="bookquote">``ohing''  (<font color='red'><b>the wives</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``ahing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wives</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Eh, but that is a true word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the wives</b></font>)</div><p/>This discourse caused quite all uproar. The hearers formed knots; the
men were indignant; so the women flattered them and took their part
openly against the preacher. A married man had a right to a drop; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
needed it, working for all the family. And for their part they did not
care to change their men for milksops.

<p/>The double faces! That very evening a hand of men caught near a hundred
of them round Brother Clement, filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) wallet with the best, and
offering him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) the very roses off their heads, and kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) frock, and
blessing him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``for taking in hand to mend their sots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Jerome thought this sermon too earthly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drunkenness is not heresy, Clement, that a whole sermon should be
preached against it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As they went on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) found to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) surprise that Clement's sermons sank
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) hearers deeper than his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) own; made them listen, think, cry, and
sometimes even amend their ways. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) hath the art of sinking to their
peg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>thought Jerome, <div class="bookquote">``Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) can soar high enough at times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon the whole it puzzled Jerome, who had a secret sense of superiority
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) tenderer brother. And after about two hundred miles of it, it
got to displease him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) as well as puzzle him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) tried to check this
sentiment as petty and unworthy. <div class="bookquote">``Souls differ like locks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``and preachers must differ like keys, or the fewer should the Church
open for God to pass in. And certes, this novice hath the key to these
northern souls, being himself a northern man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And so they came slowly down the Rhine, sometimes drifting a few miles
down the stream; but in general walking by the banks preaching, and
teaching, and confessing sinners in the towns and villages; and they
reached the town of Dusseldorf.

<p/>There was the little quay where Gerard and Denys had taken boat up the
Rhine, The friars landed on it. There were the streets, there was
<div class="bookquote">``The Silver Lion.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Nothing had changed but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), who walked through it
barefoot, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart calm and cold, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands across his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) breast,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes bent meekly on the ground, a true son of Dominic and Holy
Church.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXXI

<p/>THE HEARTH

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eli,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``answer me one question like a man, and I'll ask
no more to-day. What is wormwood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli looked a little helpless at this sudden demand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) faculties;
but soon recovered enough to say it was something that tasted main
bitter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a fair answer, my man, but not the one I look for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then answer it yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall. Wormwood is--to have two in the house a-doing nought, but
waiting for thy shoes and mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>Eli groaned. The shaft struck home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Methinks waiting for their best friend's coffin, that and nothing to
do, are enow to make them worse than Nature meant. Why not set them up
somewhere, to give `em a chance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli said he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) was willing, but afraid they would drink and gamble their
very shelves away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``Dost take me for a simpleton? Of course I mean
to watch them at starting, and drive them wi' a loose rein, as the
saying is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you think of? Not here; to divide our own custom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not likely. I say Rotterdam against the world. Then I could start
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, self-deception! The true motive of all this was to get near little
Gerard.

<p/>After many discussions and eager promises of amendment on these terms
from Cornelis and Sybrandt, Catherine went to Rotterdam shop-hunting,
and took Kate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); for a change, They soon found one, and in a good
street; but it was sadly out of order. However, they got it cheaper for
that, and instantly set about brushing it up, fitting proper shelves for
the business, and making the dwelling-house habitable.


<p/>Luke Peterson was always asking Margaret what he (<font color='blue'><b>Peterson</b></font>) could do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). The
answer used to be in a sad tone, <div class="bookquote">``Nothing, Luke, nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, you that are so clever, can you think of nothing for me to do for
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, Luke, nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) varied the reply thus: <div class="bookquote">``If you could make something to
help my sweet sister Kate about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The slave of love consented joyfully, and soon made Kate a little cart,
and cushioned it, and yoked himself into it, and at eventide drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
out of the town, and along the pleasant boulevard, with Margaret and
Catherine walking beside. It looked a happier party than it was.

<p/>Kate, for one, enjoyed it keenly, for little Gerard was put in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
lap, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) doted on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); and it was like a cherub carried by a little
angel, or a rosebud lying in the cup of a lily.

<p/>So the vulgar jeered; and asked Luke how a thistle tasted, and if his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
mistress could not afford one with four legs, etc..

<p/>Luke did not mind these jeers; but Kate minded them for him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou hast made the cart for me, good Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), ```Twas much. I
did ill to let thee draw me too; we can afford to pay some poor soul for
that. I love my rides, and to carry little Gerard; but I'd liever ride
no more than thou be mocked fort.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Much I care for their tongues,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke; ``if I did care I'd knock
their heads together. I shall draw you till my mistress says give over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Luke, if you obey Kate, you will oblige me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will obey Kate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>An honourable exception to popular humour was Jorian Ketel's wife. <div class="bookquote">``That
is strength well laid out, to draw the weak. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) prayers will be
your guerdon; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is not long for this world; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) smileth in pain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div>These were the words of Joan.

<p/>Single-minded Luke answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) did not want the poor lass's prayers
he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) did it to please his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) mistress, Margaret.

<p/>After that Luke often pressed Margaret to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) something to
do--without success.

<p/>But one day, as if tired with his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) importuning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>), and
said with a look and accent I should in vain try to convey:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Find me my boy's father.''



 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXXII

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mistress, they all say he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so. They feed me still with hopes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, to your face, but behind your back they all say he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>At this revelation Margaret's tears began to flow'.

<p/>Luke whimpered for company. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) had the body of a man but the heart of a
girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prithee, weep not so, sweet mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'd bring him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back to
life an I could, rather than see thee weed so sore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was weeping because they were so
double-tongued with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) recovered herself, and laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) shoulder, said
solemnly, ``Luke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) is not dead. Dying men are known to have a strange
sight. And listen, Luke! My poor father, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was a-dying, and I,
simple fool, was so happy, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was going to get well altogether,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said to mother and me--he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was sitting in that very chair where you
are now, and mother was as might be here, and I was yonder making a
sleeve--said he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>), `I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)!' I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)! Just so. Not like a failing man
at all, but all o' fire. `Sore disfigured-on a great river-coming this
way.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Luke, if you were a woman, and had the feeling for me you think you
have, you would pity me, and find him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) for me. Take a thought! The father
of my child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack, I would if I knew how,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, <div class="bookquote">``but how can I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, of course you cannot. I am mad to think it. But oh, if any one
really cared for me, they would; that is all I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>Luke reflected in silence for some time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The old folk all say dying men can see more than living wights. Let me
think: for my mind cannot gallop like thine. On a great river Well, the
Maas is a great river.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) pondered on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coming this way? Then if it `twas the Maas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maas</b></font>) would have been here
by this time, so `tis not the Maas. The Rhine is a great river, greater
than the Maas; and very long. I think it will be the Rhine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so do I, Luke; for Denys bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) come down the Rhine. But even if
it is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) may turn off before he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) comes anigh his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) birthplace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) does not
pine for me as I for him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>); that is clear. Luke, do you not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) has
deserted me?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) to contradict her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It looks
very like it; what a fool he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) must be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do we know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>objected Margaret imploringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me think again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot gallop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The result of this meditation was this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) knew a station about sixty
miles up the Rhine, where all the public boats put in; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) would go
to that station, and try and cut the truant off. To be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) did not
even know him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) by sight; but as each boat came in he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) would mingle with
the passengers, and ask if one Gerard was there. <div class="bookquote">``And, mistress, if you
were to give me a bit of a letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>); for, with us being strangers,
mayhap a won't believe a word I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good, kind, thoughtful Luke, I will -LRB-how I have undervalued thee!-RRB-.
But give me till supper-time to get it writ.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At supper she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) put a letter
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand with a blush; it was a long letter, tied round with silk
after the fashion of the day, and sealed over the knot.

<p/>Luke weighed it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) hand, with a shade of discontent, and said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
very gravely, <div class="bookquote">``Say your father was not dreaming, and say I have the luck
to fall in with this man, and say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should turn out a better bit of
stuff than I think him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and come home to you then and there--what is to
become o' me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret coloured to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) very brow. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Luke, Heaven will reward thee.
And I shall fall on my knees and bless thee; and I shall love thee all
my days, sweet Luke, as a mother does her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son. I am so old by thee:
trouble ages the heart. Thou shalt not go `tis not fair of me. Love
maketh us to be all self.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph!''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke. <div class="bookquote">``And if,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>resumed he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>), in the same grave way, <div class="bookquote">``yon
scapegrace shall read thy letter, and hear me tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) how thou pinest
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>), and yet, being a traitor, or a mere idiot, will not turn to
thee what shall become of me then? Must I die a bachelor, and thou fare
lonely to thy grave, neither maid, wife, nor widow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret panted with fear and emotion at this terrible piece of good
sense, and the plain question which followed it. But at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
faltered out, <div class="bookquote">``If, which our Lady be merciful to me, and forbid--Oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mistress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) should read my letter, and hear thy words--and, sweet Luke, be
just and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) what a lovely babe he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) hath, fatherless, fatherless.
Oh, Luke, can he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) be so cruel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I trow not but if?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) will give thee up my marriage lines, and I shall be an honest
woman, and a wretched one, and my boy will not be a bastard; and of
course, then we could both go into any honest man's house that would
be troubled with us; and even for thy goodness this day, I will--I
will--ne’er be so ungrateful as go past thy door to another man's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but will you come in at mine? Answer me that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ask me not! Some day, perhaps, when my wounds leave bleeding. Alas,
I'll try. If I don't fling myself and my child into the Maas. Do not go,
Luke! do not think of going! `Tis all madness from first to last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>But Luke was as slow to forego an idea as to form one.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) reply showed how fast love was making a man of him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``madness is something, anyway; and I am tired of doing nothing for thee;
and I am no great talker. To-morrow, at peep of day, I start. But hold,
I have no money. My mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) takes care of all mine; and I ne’er see
it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Margaret took out Catherine's gold angel, which had escaped so
often, and gave it to Luke; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) set out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) mad errand.

<p/>It did not, however, seem so mad to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) as to us. It was a superstitious
age; and Luke acted on the dying man's dream, or vision, or illusion, or
whatever it was, much as we should act on respectable information.

<p/>But Catherine was downright angry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heard of it, <div class="bookquote">``To send the
poor lad on such a wild-goose chase! But you are like a many more
girls; and mark my words; by the time you have worn that Luke fairly
out, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) as sick of you as a dog, you will turn as fond on him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
as a cow on a calf, and `Too late' will be the cry.''


 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>THE CLOISTER

<p/>The two friars reached Holland from the south just twelve hours after
Luke started up the Rhine.

<p/>Thus, wild-goose chase or not, the parties were nearing each other, and
rapidly too. For Jerome, unable to preach in low Dutch, now began
to push on towards the coast, anxious to get to England as soon as
possible.

<p/>And having the stream with them, the friars would in point of fact have
missed Luke by passing him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) in full stream below his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) station, but for the
incident which I am about to relate.

<p/>About twenty miles above the station Luke was making for, Clement landed
to preach in a large village; and towards the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) sermon he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
noticed a grey nun weeping.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) kindly, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) what was her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) grief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>), ```tis not for myself flow these tears; `tis for my lost
friend. Thy words reminded me of what she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) was, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) is, poor
wretch, But you are a Dominican, and I am a Franciscan nun.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It matters little, my sister, if we are both Christians, and if I can
aid thee in aught.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The nun</b></font>)</div><p/>The nun looked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) face, and said, <div class="bookquote">``These are strange words, but
methinks they are good; and thy lips are oh, most eloquent, I will tell
thee our grief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The nun</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) then let him (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) know that a young nun, the darling of the convent, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) bosom friend, had been lured away from her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) vows, and after various
gradations of sin, was actually living in a small inn as chambermaid,
in reality as a decoy, and was known to be selling her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) favours to the
wealthier customers, She (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Anywhere else we might, by kindly
violence, force her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) away from perdition, But this innkeeper was the
servant of the fierce baron on the height there, and hath his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ear still,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would burn our convent to the ground, were we to take her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) by
force.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Moreover, souls will not be saved by brute force,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement.

<p/>While they were talking Jerome came up, and Clement persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) to lie
at the convent that night, But when in the morning Clement told him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
had had a long talk with the abbess, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) was very sad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) to try and win back her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) nun, Jerome objected, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``It was not their business, and was a waste of time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>Clement, however,
was no longer a mere pupil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) stood firm, and at last they agreed that
Jerome should go forward, and secure their passage in the next ship for
England, and Clement be allowed time to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) well-meant but idle
experiment.

<p/>About ten o’clock that day, a figure in a horseman's cloak, and great
boots to match, and a large flapping felt hat, stood like a statue near
the auberge, where was the apostate nun, Mary. The friar thus disguised
was at that moment truly wretched. These ardent natures undertake
wonders; but are dashed when they come hand to hand with the sickening
difficulties. But then, as their hearts are steel, though their nerves
are anything but iron, they turn not back, but panting and dispirited,
struggle on to the last.

<p/>Clement hesitated long at the door, prayed for help and wisdom, and at
last entered the inn and sat down faint at heart, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) body in a
cold perspiration, But inside he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was another man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) called lustily for
a cup of wine: it was brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) by the landlord, He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) paid for it with
money the convent had supplied him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>); and made a show of drinking it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Landlord,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I hear there is a fair chambermaid in thine
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, stranger, the buxomest in Holland. But she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gives not her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) company to
all comers only to good customers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Friar</b></font>)</div><p/>Friar Clement dangled a massive gold chain in the landlord's sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
laughed, and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Here, Janet, here is a lover for thee would
bind thee in chains of gold; and a tall lad into the bargain, I promise
thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I am in double luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement</b></font>)</div>said a female voice; <div class="bookquote">``send him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hither.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement rose, shuddered, and passed into the room, where Janet was
seated playing with a piece of work, and laying it down every minute, to
sing a mutilated fragment of a song. For, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) mode of life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) had
not the patience to carry anything out.

<p/>After a few words of greeting, the disguised visitor asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) if they
could not be more private somewhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) rose and smiled, and went tripping before
him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) followed, groaning inwardly, and sore perplexed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Have no fear! Nobody ever comes here, but such as
pay for the privilege.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement looked round the room, and prayed silently for wisdom. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
went softly, and closed the window-shutters carefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth is that for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>said Janet, in some uneasiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sweetheart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>whispered the visitor, with a mysterious air, ``it is that
God may not see us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>said Janet; <div class="bookquote">``think you a wooden shutter can keep out His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I know not. Perchance He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has too much on hand to notice us, But I
would not the saints and angels should see us. Would you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor soul, hope not to escape their sight! The only way is not to
think of them; for if you do, it poisons your cup. For two pins I'd run
and leave thee. Art pleasant company in sooth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After all, girl, so that men see us not, what signify God and the
saints seeing us? Feel this chain! `Tis virgin gold. I shall cut two of
these heavy links off for thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! now thy discourse is to the point,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) handled the chain
greedily. <div class="bookquote">``Why, `tis as massy as the chain round the virgin's neck at
the conv--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) did not finish the word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whisht! whisht! whisht! `Tis it. And thou shalt have thy share. But
betray me not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monster!''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>cried Janet, drawing back from him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) with repugnance; <div class="bookquote">``what,
rob the blessed Virgin of her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) chain, and give it to an--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are none,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried Clement exultingly, <div class="bookquote">``or you had not recked for
that-Mary!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! ah! ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thy patron saint, whose chain this is, sends me to greet thee''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) ran screaming to the window and began to undo the shutters.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) fingers trembled, and Clement had time to debarass himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
boots and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) hat before the light streamed in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) then let his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
cloak quietly fall, and stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>), a Dominican friar, calm and
majestic as a statue, and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) crucifix towering over her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) with a
loving, sad, and solemn look, that somehow relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) of the physical
part of fear, but crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) with religious terror and remorse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>)
crouched and cowered against the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) gently; <div class="bookquote">``one word! Are you happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As happy as I shall be in hell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they are not happy at the convent; they weep for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Day and night; above all, the Sister Ursula.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Ursula!''  (<font color='red'><b>the nun</b></font>)</div>And the strayed nun began to weep herself at the thought
of her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The angels weep still more. Wilt not dry all their tears in earth and
heaven and save thyself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! would I could; but it is too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Satan avaunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div>cried the monk sternly. ```Tis thy favourite temptation;
and thou, Mary, listen not to the enemy of man, belying God, and
whispering despair. I who come to save thee have been a far greater
sinner than thou. Come, Mary, sin, thou seest, is not so sweet, e’n in
this world, as holiness; and eternity is at the door.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can they ever receive me again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis their worthiness thou doubtest now. But in truth they pine for
thee. `Twas in pity of their tears that I, a Dominican, undertook this
task; and broke the rule of my order by entering an inn; and broke it
again by donning these lay vestments. But all is well done, and quit for
a light penance, if thou wilt let us rescue thy soul from this den of
wolves, and bring thee back to thy vows.''

<p/>The nun gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``And thou, a Dominican,
hast done this for a daughter of St. Francis! Why, the Franciscans and
Dominicans hate one another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, my daughter; but Francis and Dominic love one another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The nun</b></font>)</div><p/>The recreant nun seemed struck and affected by this answer

<p/>Clement now reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) how shocked she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) had been that the Virgin should
be robbed of her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) chain. <div class="bookquote">``But see now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the convent, and
the Virgin too, think ten times more of their poor nun than of golden
chains; for they freely trusted their chain to me a stranger, that
peradventure the sight of it might touch their lost Mary and remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
of their love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) with such terrible simplicity the
end of her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) present course, and on the other hand so revived her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) dormant
memories and better feelings, that she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) kneeled sobbing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) feet, and
owned she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) had never known happiness nor peace since she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>)
vows; and said she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) would go back if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) would go with her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>); but alone
she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) dared not, could not: even if she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) reached the gate she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) could never
enter. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) face the abbess and the sisters? He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
would go with her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) as joyfully as the shepherd bears a strayed lamb to
the fold.

<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) urged her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) to go at once, up sprung a crop of those
prodigiously petty difficulties that entangle her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) sex, like silken nets,
liker iron cobwebs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) quietly swept them aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can I walk beside thee in this habit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have brought the gown and cowl of thy holy order. Hide thy bravery
with them. And leave thy shoes as I leave these''  (<font color='red'><b>horseman</b></font>)</div>-LRB-pointing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
horseman's boots-RRB-.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) collected her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) jewels and ornaments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are these for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>inquired Clement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To present to the convent, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Their source is too impure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>objected the penitent, <div class="bookquote">``it would be a sin to leave them here.
They can be sold to feed the poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary, fix thine eye on this crucifix, and trample those devilish
baubles beneath thy feet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) hesitated; but soon threw them down and trampled on them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now open the window and fling them out on that dunghill. `Tis well
done. So pass the wages of sin from thy hands, its glittering yoke from
thy neck, its pollution from thy soul. Away, daughter of St. Francis, we
tarry in this vile place too long.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>).

<p/>But they were not clear yet.

<p/>At first the landlord was so astounded at seeing a black friar and a
grey nun pass through his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) kitchen from the inside, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) gaped, and
muttered, <div class="bookquote">``Why, what mummery is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) soon comprehended the
matter, and whipped in between the fugitives and the door. <div class="bookquote">``What ho!
Reuben! Carl! Gavin! here is a false friar spiriting away our Janet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The men came running in with threatening looks. The friar rushed at them
crucifix in hand. <div class="bookquote">``Forbear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) cried, in a stentorian voice. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) is
a holy nun returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) vows. The hand that touches her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) cowl or her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>)
robe to stay her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>), it shall wither, his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) body shall lie unburied, cursed
by Rome, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) soul shall roast in eternal fire.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They shrank back as
if a flame had met them. <div class="bookquote">``And thou--miserable panderer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) did not end the sentence in words, but seized the man by the neck,
and strong as a lion in his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) moments of hot excitement, hurled him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
furiously from the door and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) all across the room, pitching head
foremost on to the stone floor; then tore the door open and carried the
screaming nun out into the road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! poor trembler,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) gasped; <div class="bookquote">``they dare not molest thee on the
highroad. Away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlord lay terrified, half stunned, and bleeding; and Mary, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) often looked back apprehensively, saw no more of him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>).

<p/>On the road he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) observe his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) impetuosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hitherto,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we have spoken of thy faults: now for mine. My
choler is ungovernable; furious. It is by the grace of God I am not a
murderer, I repent the next moment; but a moment too late is all too
late. Mary, had the churls laid finger on thee, I should have scattered
their brains with my crucifix, Oh, I know myself; go to; and tremble at
myself. There lurketh a wild beast beneath this black gown of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Virgin Mary/Virgin</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``were you other than you are I had been lost.
To take me from that place needed a man wary as a fox; yet bold as a
lion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Virgin Mary/Virgin</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement reflected. <div class="bookquote">``This much is certain: God chooseth well his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fleshly
instruments; and with imperfect hearts doeth His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) perfect work, Glory be
to God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Virgin Mary/Virgin</b></font>)</div><p/>When they were near the convent Mary suddenly stopped, and seized the
friar's arm, and began to cry. He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) kindly, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had nothing to fear. It would be the happiest day she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever spent.
He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) then made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sit down and compose herself till he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) should return, He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
entered the convent, and desired to see the abbess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister, give the glory to God: Mary is at the gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the abbess</b></font>)</div><p/>The astonishment and delight of the abbess were unbounded.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) yielded at once to Clement's earnest request that the road of
penitence might be smoothed at first to this unstable wanderer, and
after some opposition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) entered heartily into his (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) views as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
actual reception. To give time for their little preparations Clement
went slowly back, and seating himself by Mary soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
confession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The abbess has granted me that you shall propose your own penance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be none the lighter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trow not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but that is future: to-day is given to joy
alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) then led her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) round the building to the abbess's postern.

<p/>As they went they heard musical instruments and singing.

<p/>```Tis a feastday,'' said Mary; <div class="bookquote">``and I come to mar it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement, smiling; <div class="bookquote">``seeing that you are the queen of the
fete.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I, father? what mean you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Mary, have you never heard that there is more joy in heaven over
one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety-nine just persons which need
no repentance? Now this convent is not heaven; nor the nuns angels; yet
are there among then, some angelic spirits; and these sing and exult
at thy return. But here methinks comes one of them; for I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand
trembles at the keyhole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sister</b></font>)</div><p/>The postern was flung open, and in a moment Sister Ursula clung sobbing
and kissing round her (<font color='blue'><b>Ursula</b></font>) friend's neck. The abbess followed more sedately,
but little less moved.

<p/>Clement bade them farewell. They entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) to stay; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) told them
with much regret he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) could not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had already tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) good Brother
Jerome's patience, and must hasten to the river; and perhaps sail for
England to-morrow.

<p/>So Mary returned to the fold, and Clement strode briskly on towards the
Rhine, and England.

<p/>This was the man for whom Margaret's boy lay in wait with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) letter.


<p/>THE HEARTH

<p/>And that letter was one of those simple, touching appeals only her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sex
can write to those who have used them cruelly, and they love them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
began by telling him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) of the birth of the little boy, and the comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in all the distress of mind his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) long and strange silence
had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) described the little Gerard minutely, not forgetting
the mole on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) little finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Know you any one that hath the like on his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>)? If you only saw him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) you
could not choose but be proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>); all the mothers in the street do
envy me; but I the wives; for thou comest not to us. My own Gerard, some
say thou art dead. But if thou wert dead, how could I be alive? Others
say that thou, whom I love so truly, art false. But this will I believe
from no lips but thine. My father loved thee well; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lay a-dying
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw thee on a great river, with thy face turned towards
thy Margaret, but sore disfigured. Is't so, perchance? Have cruel men
scarred thy sweet face? or hast thou lost one of thy precious limbs?
Why, then thou hast the more need of me, and I shall love thee not
worse, alas! thinkest thou a woman's love is light as a man's? but
better, than I did when I shed those few drops from my arm, not worth
the tears, thou didst shed for them; mindest thou? `tis not so very long
agone, dear Gerard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The letter continued in this strain, and concluded without a word of
reproach or doubt as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) faith and affection. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was free
from most distressing doubts; but they were not certainties; and to show
them might turn the scale, and frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with fear of
being scolded. And of this letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) made soft Luke the bearer.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was not an angel after all.

<p/>Luke mingled with the passengers of two boats, and could hear nothing of
Gerard Eliassoen. Nor did this surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) was more surprised when, at the third attempt, a black friar said
to him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), somewhat severely, <div class="bookquote">``And what would you with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) you call Gerard
Eliassoen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, father, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is alive I have got a letter for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div>said Jerome. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for it, However, the flesh is weak.
Well, my son, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) you seek will be here by the next boat, or the next
boat after. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) chooses to answer to that name--After all, I am
not the keeper of his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) conscience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good father, one plain word, for Heaven's sake, This Gerard Eliassoen
of Tergou--is he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! Why, certes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliassoen</b></font>) that went by that name is alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, that is settled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke drily. But the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
found it necessary to run out of sight and blubber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, why did the Lord make any women?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) to himself. <div class="bookquote">``I was
content with the world till I fell in love. Here his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) little finger is
more to her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) than my whole body, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is not dead, And here I have got
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) this.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) looked at the letter and dashed it on the ground.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) picked it up again with a spiteful snatch, and went to the
landlord, with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) eyes, and begged for work, The landlord
declined, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) own people.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I seek not your money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, <div class="bookquote">``I only want some work to keep
me from breaking my heart about another man's lass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good lad! good lad!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exploded the landlord; and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) lots of
barrels to mend--on these terms, And he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) coopered with fury in the
interval of the boats coming down the Rhine.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXXIII

<p/>THE HEARTH

<p/>Waiting an earnest letter seldom leaves the mind in statu quo.

<p/>Margaret, in hers, vented her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) energy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) faith in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dying father's
vision, or illusion; and when this was done, and Luke gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wondered
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) credulity, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) conscience pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) about Luke; and
Catherine came and scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) paid the price of false hopes,
and elevation of spirits, by falling into deeper despondency. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
found in this state by a staunch friend she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had lately made, Joan Ketel.
This good woman came in radiant with an idea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret, I know the cure for thine ill: the hermit of Gouda a wondrous
holy man, Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can tell what is coming, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in the mood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, I have heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret hopelessly. Joan with some
difficulty persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) to walk out as far as Gouda, and consult the
hermit. They took some butter and eggs in a basket, and went to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
cave.

<p/>What had made the pair such fast friends? Jorian some six weeks ago fell
ill of a bowel disease; it began with raging pain; and when this went
off, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) weak, an awkward symptom succeeded; nothing, either
liquid or solid, would stay in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stomach a minute. The doctor said:
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must die if this goes on many hours; therefore boil thou now a
chicken with a golden angel in the water, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) sup that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>Alas! Gilt chicken broth shared the fate of the humbler viands, its
predecessors. Then the cure steeped the thumb of St. Sergius in beef
broth. Same result. Then Joan ran weeping to Margaret to borrow some
linen to make his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) shroud. <div class="bookquote">``Let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came in
and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pulse. <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), ``I doubt they have not gone to the
root. Open the window! Art stifling him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>); now change all his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) linen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack, woman, what for? Why foul more linen for a dying man?''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>objected
the mediaeval wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do as thou art bid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret dully, and left the room.

<p/>Joan somehow found herself doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) was bid. Margaret returned with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) apron full of a flowering herb. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) made a decoction, and took it
to the bedside; and before giving it to the patient, took a spoonful
herself, and smacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lips hypocritically. <div class="bookquote">``That is fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>),
with a feeble attempt at humour. <div class="bookquote">``Why, `tis sweet, and now `tis bitter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) in conversation as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had taken it. This
bitter-sweet stayed by him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>). Seeing which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) built on it as cards are
built: mixed a very little schiedam in the third spoonful, and a little
beaten yoke of egg in the seventh. And so with the patience of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sex
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) coaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) body out of Death's grasp; and finally, Nature, being
patted on the back, instead of kicked under the bed, set Jorian Ketel
on his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) legs again. But the doctress made them both swear never to tell a
soul her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) guilty deed. <div class="bookquote">``They would put me in prison, away from my child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>The simple that saved Jorian was called sweet feverfew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gathered it
in his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) own garden. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eagle eye had seen it growing out of the window.

<p/>Margaret and Joan, then, reached the hermit's cave, and placed their
present on the little platform. Margaret then applied her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mouth to the
aperture, made for that purpose, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Holy hermit, we bring thee
butter and eggs of the best; and I, a poor deserted girl, wife, yet no
wife, and mother of the sweetest babe, come to pray thee tell me whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is quick or dead, true to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vows or false.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>A faint voice issued from the cave: <div class="bookquote">``Trouble me not with the things of
earth, but send me a holy friar, I am dying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Is it e'en so, poor soul? Then let us in to
help thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saints forbid! Thine is a woman's voice. Send me a holy friar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went back as they came. Joan could not help saying, <div class="bookquote">``Are women imps
o' darkness then, that they must not come anigh a dying bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>But Margaret was too deeply dejected to say anything. Joan applied rough
consolation. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) was not listened to till she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``And Jorian will
speak out ere long; he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) is just on the boil, He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) is very grateful to thee,
believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seeing is believing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>replied Margaret, with quiet bitterness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not but what he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) thinks you might have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) with something more out
o' the common than yon. `A man of my inches to be cured wi' feverfew,'
says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). `Why, if there is a sorry herb,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). `Why, I was thinking
o' pulling all mine up, says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I up and told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remedies were none
the better for being far-fetched; you and feverfew cured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when the

folk coming around ye, and good friends, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said only last night--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Ay, we are wading in deep waters, my poor babe
and me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Saturday night and no Luke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Luke!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``It was very good of him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) to go on such an
errand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) is one out of a hundred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>replied Catherine warmly.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would. So do you be kinder to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) comes back! Will

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>THE CLOISTER

<p/>Brother Clement, directed by the nuns, avoided a bend in the river, and
striding lustily forward, reached a station some miles nearer the coast
than that where Luke lay in wait for Gerard Eliassoen. And the next
morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) started early, and was in Rotterdam at noon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) made at once
for the port, not to keep Jerome waiting.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) observed several monks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) order on the quay; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) went to them;
but Jerome was not amongst them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) asked one of them whether Jerome had
arrived? ``Surely, brother, was the reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prithee, where is he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where? Why, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div>said the monk, pointing to a ship in full sail. And
Clement now noticed that all the monks were looking seaward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, gone without me! Oh, Jerome! Jerome!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), in a voice of
anguish. Several of the friars turned round and stared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be brother Clement,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said one of them at length; and on this
they kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) and greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) with brotherly warmth, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) a
letter Jerome had charged them with for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>). It was a hasty scrawl. The
writer told him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) coldly a ship was about to sail for England, and he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was
loth to lose time. He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) -LRB-Clement-RRB- might follow if he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) pleased, but he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) would
do much better to stay behind, and preach to his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) own country folk. ``Give
the glory to God, brother; you have a wonderful power over Dutch hearts;
but you are no match for those haughty islanders: you are too tender.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Know thou that on the way I met one, who asked me for thee under the
name thou didst bear in the world. Be on thy guard! Let not the world
catch thee again by any silken net, And remember, Solitude, Fasting, and
Prayer are the sword, spear, and shield of the soul. Farewell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement was deeply shocked and mortified at this contemptuous desertion,
and this cold-blooded missive.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) promised the good monks to sleep at the convent, and to preach
wherever the prior should appoint for Jerome had raised him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) to the skies
as a preacher, and then withdrew abruptly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) was cut to the quick,
and wanted to be alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) asked himself, was there some incurable fault
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>), repulsive to so true a son of Dominic? Or was Jerome himself
devoid of that Christian Love which St. Paul had placed above Faith
itself? Shipwrecked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>), and saved on the same fragment of the
wreck: his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) pupil, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) penitent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) son in the Church, and now for four
hundred miles his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) fellow-traveller in Christ; and to be shaken off like
dirt, the first opportunity, with harsh and cold disdain. <div class="bookquote">``Why worldly
hearts are no colder nor less trusty than this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The only
one that ever really loved me lies in a grave hard by. Fly me, fly to
England, man born without a heart; I will go and pray over a grave at
Sevenbergen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Three hours later he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) passed Peter's cottage. A troop of noisy children
were playing about the door, and the house had been repaired, and a
new outhouse added. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) head hastily away, not to disturb a
picture his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) memory treasured; and went to the churchyard.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) sought among the tombstones for Margaret's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) could not find it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) could not believe they had grudged her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) a tombstone, so searched the
churchyard all over again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh poverty! stern poverty! Poor soul, thou wert like me no one was left
that loved thee, when Gerard was gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) went into the church, and after kissing the steps, prayed long and
earnestly for the soul of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) whose resting-place he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) could not find.

<p/>Coming out of the church he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) saw a very old man looking over the little
churchyard gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) went towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>), and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) live in the
place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four score and twelve years, man and boy. And I come here every day
of late, holy father, to take a peep. This is where I look to bide ere
long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My son, can you tell me where Margaret lies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret? There's a many Margarets here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret Brandt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was daughter to a learned physician.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if I didn't know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man pettishly. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) doesn't
lie here. Bless you, they left this a longful while ago. Gone in a
moment, and the house empty. What, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dead? Margaret a Peter dead?
Now only think on't. Like enow; like enow, They great towns do terribly
disagree wi' country folk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What great towns, my son?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `twas Rotterdam they went to from here, so I heard tell; or was
it Amsterdam? Nay, I trow `twas Rotterdam? And gone there to die!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement sighed.

<p/>```Twas not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face now, that I saw. And I can mostly tell, Alack,
there was a blooming young flower to be cut off so soon, and all old
weed like me left standing still. Well, well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was a May rose yon;
dear heart, what a winsome smile she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had, and--''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless thee, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Clement; <div class="bookquote">``farewell!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) hurried away.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) reached the convent at sunset, and watched and prayed in the chapel
for Jerome and Margaret till it was long past midnight, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) soul had
recovered its cold calm.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXXIV

<p/>THE HEARTH

<p/>The next day, Sunday, after mass, was a bustling day at Catherine's
house in the Hoog Straet. The shop was now quite ready, and Cornelis and
Sybrandt were to open it next day; their names were above the door; also
their sign, a white lamb sucking a gilt sheep. Eli had come, and brought
them some more goods from his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) store to give them a good start. The
hearts of the parents glowed at what they were doing, and the pair
themselves walked in the garden together, and agreed they were sick of
their old life, and it was more pleasant to make money than waste it;
they vowed to stick to business like wax. Their mother's quick and ever
watchful ear overheard this resolution through an open window, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
told Eli, The family supper was to include Margaret and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy, and be
a kind of inaugural feast, at which good trade advice was to flow from
the elders, and good wine to be drunk to the success of the converts
to Commerce from Agriculture in its unremunerative form--wild oats. So
Margaret had come over to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mother-in-law, and also to shake
off her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own deep languor; and both their faces were as red as the fire.
Presently in came Joan with a salad from Jorian's garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cut it for you, Margaret; you are all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) chat; I shall be jealous.
I told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) you were to feast to-day. But oh, lass, what a sermon in the
new kerk! Preaching? I never heard it till this day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would I had been there then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``for I am dried up for
want of dew from heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) preacheth again this afternoon. But mayhap you are wanted
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Come, away ye go, if y’are minded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``methinks I should not be such a damper at
table if I could come to `t warm from a good sermon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you must be brisk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div>observed Joan. <div class="bookquote">``See the folk are wending that
way, and as I live, there goes the holy friar. Oh, bless us and save us,
Margaret; the hermit! We forgot.''  (<font color='red'><b>this woman</b></font>)</div>And this active woman bounded out of
the house, and ran across the road, and stopped the friar. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) returned
as quickly. <div class="bookquote">``There, I was bent on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) nigh hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What said he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) to thee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Says he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), `My daughter, I will go to him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) ere sunset, God willing.' The
sweetest voice. But oh, my mistresses, what thin cheeks for a young man,
and great eyes, not far from your colour, Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a great mind to go hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``But my cap is not
very clean, and they will all be there in their snow-white mutches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, take my handkerchief out of the basket,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``you
cannot have the child, I want him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for my poor Kate. It is one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) ill
days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret replied by taking the boy upstairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found Kate in bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How art thou, sweetheart? Nay, I need not ask. Thou art in sore pain;
thou smilest so, See,' I have brought thee one thou lovest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two, by my way of counting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, with an angelic smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had
a spasm at that moment would have made some of us roar like bulls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, in your lap?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, answering a gesture of the suffering
girl. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is too heavy, and thou in such pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too dear to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) weight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>was the reply.

<p/>Margaret took this opportunity, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) toilet. <div class="bookquote">``I am for the
kerk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to hear a beautiful preacher.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Kate sighed. <div class="bookquote">``And a
minute ago, Kate, I was all agog to go; that is the way with me this

I'd as lieve stay aside thee; say the word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, <div class="bookquote">``prithee go; and bring me back every word. Well-a-day
that I cannot go myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>And the tears stood in the patient's eyes.
This decided Margaret, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) kissed Kate, looked under her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) lashes at
the boy, and heaved a little sigh. <div class="bookquote">``I trow I must not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
never could kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) a little; and my father was dead against waking

lovingly over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) shoulder, and shut the door inaudibly.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Joan, you will lend me a hand, and peel these?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I will, dame.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the cooking proceeded with silent vigour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Joan, them which help me cook and serve the meat, they help me eat
it; that's a rule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's worse laws in Holland than that. Your will is my pleasure,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, woman, yon is an ugly trade. There she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has just washed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face

 (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>Joan and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) both followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) to the door, and stood at it watching
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) a good way down the street. For among homely housewives going out
o' doors is half an incident. Catherine commented on the launch: <div class="bookquote">``There,
Joan, it is almost to me as if I had just started my own daughter for
kerk, and stood a looking after: the which I've done it manys and manys
the times. Joan, lass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) won't hear a word against our Gerard; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) be alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) has used her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) cruel; that is why my bowels yearn for the
poor wench. I'm older and wiser than she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>); and so I'll wed her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) to yon
simple Luke, and there an end. What's one grandchild?''



 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXXV

<p/>THE CLOISTER AND THE HEARTH

<p/>The sermon had begun when Margaret entered the great church of St.
Laurens. It was a huge edifice, far from completed. Churches were not
built in a year. The side aisles were roofed, but not the mid aisle nor
the chancel; the pillars and arches were pretty perfect, and some of
them whitewashed. But only one window in the whole church was glazed;
the rest were at present great jagged openings in the outer walls.

<p/>But to-day all these uncouth imperfections made the church beautiful.
It was a glorious summer afternoon, and the sunshine came broken into
marvellous forms through those irregular openings, and played bewitching
pranks upon so many broken surfaces.

<p/>It streamed through the gaping walls, and clove the dark cool side
aisles with rivers of glory, and dazzled and glowed on the white pillars
beyond.

<p/>And nearly the whole central aisle was chequered with light and shade in
broken outlines; the shades seeming cooler and more soothing than ever
shade was, and the lights like patches of amber diamond animated with
heavenly fire. And above, from west to east the blue sky vaulted the
lofty aisle, and seemed quite close.

<p/>The sunny caps of the women made a sea of white contrasting exquisitely
with that vivid vault of blue.

<p/>For the mid aisle, huge as it was, was crammed, yet quite still. The
words and the mellow, gentle, earnest voice of the preacher held them
mute.

<p/>Margaret stood spellbound at the beauty, the devotion, <div class="bookquote">``the great calm,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) got behind a pillar in the north aisle; and there, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could
hardly catch a word, a sweet devotional langour crept over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) at the
loveliness of the place and the preacher's musical voice; and balmy oil
seemed to trickle over the waves in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heart and smooth them. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
leaned against the pillar with eyes half closed, and all seemed soft and
dreamy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt it good to be there.

<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw a lady leave an excellent place opposite to get out of
the sun, which was indeed pouring on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head from the window. Margaret
went round softly but swiftly; and was fortunate enough to get the
place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was now beside a pillar of the south aisle, and not above
fifty feet from the preacher. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was at his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) side, a little behind him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>),
but could hear every word.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) attention, however, was soon distracted by the shadow of a man's
head and shoulders bobbing up and down so drolly she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had some ado to
keep from smiling.

<p/>Yet it was nothing essentially droll.

<p/>It was the sexton digging.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found that out in a moment by looking behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), through the
window, to whence the shadow came.

<p/>Now as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was looking at Jorian Ketel digging, suddenly a tone of the
preacher's voice fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ear and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind so distinctly, it seemed
literally to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) vibrate inside and out.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bosom, so strange and sudden was the thrill. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned round, and looked at the preacher. His (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) back was turned, and
nothing visible but his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) tonsure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sighed. That tonsure, being all she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
saw, contradicted the tone effectually.

<p/>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) now leaned a little forward with downcast eyes, hoping for that
accent again. It did not come. But the whole voice grew strangely upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). It rose and fell as the preacher warmed; and it seemed to waken
faint echoes of a thousand happy memories. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would not look to dispel
the melancholy pleasure this voice gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>Presently, in the middle of an eloquent period, the preacher stopped.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) almost sighed; a soothing music had ended. Could the sermon be ended
already? No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) looked round; the people did not move.

<p/>A good many faces seemed now to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) way.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) looked behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
sharply. There was nothing there.

<p/>Startled countenances near her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) now eyed the preacher. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) followed their
looks; and there, in the pulpit, was a face as of a staring corpse. The
friar's eyes, naturally large, and made larger by the thinness of his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
cheeks, were dilated to supernatural size, and glaring her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) way out of a
bloodless face.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cringed and turned fearfully round: for she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thought there must be
some terrible thing near her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). No; there was nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was the outside
figure of the listening crowd.

<p/>At this moment the church fell into commotion, Figures got up all over
the building, and craned forward; agitated faces by hundreds gazed from
the friar to Margaret, and from Margaret to the friar. The turning to
and fro of so many caps made a loud rustle. Then came shrieks of nervous
women, and buzzing of men; and Margaret, seeing so many eyes levelled at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), shrank terrified behind the pillar, with one scared, hurried glance
at the preacher.

<p/>Momentary as that glance was, it caught in that stricken face an
expression that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) shiver.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned faint, and sat down on a heap of chips the workmen had left,
and buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands, The sermon went on again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heard
the sound of it; but not the sense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tried to think, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind was
in a whirl, Thought would fix itself in no shape but this: that on that
prodigy-stricken face she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had seen a look stamped. And the recollection
of that look now made her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) quiver from head to foot.

<p/>For that look was <div class="bookquote">``RECOGNITION.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the preacher</b></font>)</div><p/>The sermon, after wavering some time, ended in a strain of exalted,
nay, feverish eloquence, that went far to make the crowd forget the
preacher's strange pause and ghastly glare. Margaret mingled hastily
with the crowd, and went out of the church with them.

<p/>They went their ways home. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned at the door, and went into the
churchyard; to Peter's grave. Poor as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) a slab
and a headstone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sat down on the slab, and kissed it. Then threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head that no one might distinguish her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``thou hast often heard me say I am wading in deep
waters; but now I begin to think God only knows the bottom of them. I'll
follow that friar round the world, but I'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) at arm's length. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) shall tell me why he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) looked towards me like a dead man wakened; and
not a soul behind me. Oh, father; you often praised me here: speak a
word for me there. For I am wading in deep waters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father's tomb commanded a side view of the church door. And on that
tomb she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sat, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face covered, waylaying the holy preacher.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXXVI

<p/>THE CLOISTER AND THE HEARTH

<p/>The cool church chequered with sunbeams and crowned with heavenly
purple, soothed and charmed Father Clement, as it did Margaret; and
more, it carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) mind direct to the Creator of all good and pure
delights. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eye fell on the great aisle crammed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) country
folk; a thousand snowy caps, filigreed with gold. Many a hundred leagues
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had travelled; but seen nothing like them, except snow. In the
morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had thundered; but this sweet afternoon seemed out of tune
with threats. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) bowels yearned over that multitude; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) must tell
them of God's love: poor souls, they heard almost as little of it
from the pulpit then a days as the heathen used. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) told them the glad
tidings of salvation. The people hung upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) gentle, earnest tongue.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was not one of those preachers who keep gyrating in the pulpit like
the weathercock on the steeple. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) moved the hearts of others more than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) own body. But on the other hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) did not entirely neglect those
who were in bad places. And presently, warm with this theme, that none
of all that multitude might miss the joyful tidings of Christ's love, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) towards the south aisle.

<p/>And there, in a stream of sunshine from the window, was the radiant face
of Margaret Brandt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) gazed at it without emotion. It just benumbed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), soul and body.

<p/>But soon the words died in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) throat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) glared at
it.

<p/>There, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) auburn hair bathed in sunbeams, and glittering like the
gloriola of a saint, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) face glowing doubly, with its own beauty,
and the sunshine it was set in-stood his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) dead love.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was leaning very lightly against a white column. She (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was listening
with tender, downcast lashes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) listen so to him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) a hundred times.

<p/>There was no change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>). This was the blooming Margaret he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) had left:
only a shade riper and more lovely.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) started at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with monstrous eyes and bloodless cheeks.

<p/>The people died out of his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) heard, as in a dream, a rustling
and rising all over the church; but could not take his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) prodigy-stricken
eyes off that face, all life, and bloom, and beauty, and that wondrous
auburn hair glistening gloriously in the sun.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) gazed, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must vanish.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remained.

<p/>All in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>), full.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own violet eyes!!

<p/>At this he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) was beside himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) lips parted to shriek out her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
name, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head swiftly, and soon after vanished, but not
without one more glance, which, though rapid as lightning, encountered
his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>), and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) couching and quivering with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind in a whirl, and
him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) panting and gripping the pulpit convulsively. For this glance of
hers, though not recognition, was the startled inquiring, nameless,
indescribable look that precedes recognition. He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) made a mighty effort,
and muttered something nobody could understand: then feebly resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>)
discourse; and stammered and babbled on a while, till by degrees forcing
himself, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was out of sight, to look on it as a vision from the
other world, he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) rose into a state of unnatural excitement, and concluded
in a style of eloquence that electrified the simple; for it bordered on
rhapsody.

<p/>The sermon ended, he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) sat down on the pulpit stool, terribly shaken, But
presently an idea very characteristic of the time took possession of
him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>), He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) had sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) grave at Sevenbergen in vain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had now been
permitted to appear to him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>), and show him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was buried here;
probably hard by that very pillar, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) spirit had showed itself to
him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>).

<p/>This idea once adopted soon settled on his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) mind with all the Certainty
of a fact. And he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) had only to speak to the sexton -LRB-whom to his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>)
great disgust he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) had seen working during the sermon-RRB-, to learn the spot
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was laid.

<p/>The church was now quite empty. He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) came down from the pulpit and stepped
through an aperture in the south wall on to the grass, and went up to
the sexton. He (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) in a moment. But Jorian never suspected the
poor lad, whose life he (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) had saved, in this holy friar. The loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>)
shapely beard had wonderfully altered the outline of his (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) face. This had
changed him (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) even more than his (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) tonsure, his (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) short hair sprinkled with
premature grey, and his (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) cheeks thinned and paled by fasts and vigils.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Friar Clement</b></font>)</div>said Friar Clement softly, <div class="bookquote">``if you keep any memory of those
whom you lay in the earth, prithee tell me is any Christian buried
inside the church, near one of the pillars?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Friar Clement</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>said Jorian, <div class="bookquote">``here in the churchyard lie buried all that
buried be. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter, Prithee tell me then where lieth Margaret Brandt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret Brandt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>And Jorian stared stupidly at the speaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) died about three years ago, and was buried here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that is another matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>said Jorian; <div class="bookquote">``that was before my time; the
vicar could tell you, likely; if so be she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) was a gentlewoman, or at the
least rich enough to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) fee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, my son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) was poor -LRB-and paid a heavy penalty for it-RRB-; but born
of decent folk. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) father, Peter, was a learned physician; she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) came
hither from Sevenbergen--to die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>When Clement had uttered these words his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) head sunk upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) breast, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) seemed to have no power nor wish to question Jorian more. I doubt
even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was lost in the past.

<p/>Jorian put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) spade, and standing upright in the grave, set his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
arms akimbo, and said sulkily, <div class="bookquote">``Are you making a fool of me, holy sir,
or has some wag been making a fool of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>And having relieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) mind
thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) proceeded to dig again, with a certain vigour that showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
somewhat irritable temper was ruffled.

<p/>Clement gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) with a puzzled but gently reproachful eye, for
the tone was rude, and the words unintelligible. Good-natured, though
crusty, Jorian had not thrown up three spadefuls ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) became ashamed
of it himself. <div class="bookquote">``Why, what a base churl am I to speak thus to thee, holy
father; and thou a standing there, looking at me like a lamb. Aha! I
have it; `tis Peter Brandt's grave you would fain see, not Margaret's.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) does lie here; hard by the west door. There; I'll show you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) spade, and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) doublet and jerkin to go with the
friar.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) did not know there was anybody sitting on Peter's tomb. Still less
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was watching for this holy friar.

<p/>Pietro Vanucci and Andrea did not recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) without his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) beard. The
fact is, that the beard which has never known a razor grows in a very
picturesque and characteristic form, and becomes a feature in the face;
so that its removal may in some cases be an effectual disguise.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXXVII

<p/>While Jorian was putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vanucci</b></font>) doublet and jerkin to go to Peter's
tomb, his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) tongue was not idle. <div class="bookquote">``They used to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) a magician out
Sevenbergen way. And they do say he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) gave `em a touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) trade at
parting; told `em he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) saw Margaret's lad a-coming down Rhine in brave
clothes and store o' money, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) face scarred by foreign glaive,
and not altogether so many arms and legs as a went away wi'. But, dear
heart, nought came on't. Margaret is still wearying for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lad; and
Peter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) lies as quiet as his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) neighbours; not but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hath put a
stone slab over him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is: as you shall see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) put both hands on the edge of the grave, and was about to raise
himself out of it, but the friar laid a trembling hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) shoulder,
and said in a strange whisper--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long since died Peter Brandt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About two months, Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) daughter buried him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>), say you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I buried him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) paid the fee and reared the stone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) had just one daughter; Margaret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more leastways, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) owned to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you think Margaret is--is alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think? Why, I should be dead else. Riddle me that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, how can I? You love her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more than reason, being a married man, and father of four more
sturdy knaves like myself. Nay, the answer is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saved my life scarce

Bless your heart, I couldn't keep a thing on my stomach; nor doctors
couldn't make me. My Joan says, `'Tis time to buy thee a shroud.' `I dare
say, so `tis,' says I; but try and borrow one first.' In comes my lady,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The surprise--the joy--the wonder--the fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement</b></font>)</div>gasped Clement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what is it to thee? Art thou of kin to Margaret Brandt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay; but I knew one that loved her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) well, so well her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) death nigh killed

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>Jorian stared, and after a considerable silence said very gravely,
<div class="bookquote">``Father, you have asked me many questions, and I have answered them
truly; now for our Lady's sake answer me but two. Did you in very sooth
know one who loved this poor lass? Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement was on the point of revealing himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) remembered
Jerome's letter, and shrank from being called by the name he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had borne
in the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) in Italy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) you can tell me his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>said Jorian cautiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) name was Gerard Eliassoen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but this is strange. Stay, what made thee say Margaret Brandt was
dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was with Gerard when a letter came from Margaret Van Eyck. The letter

laid for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). Mine is but a dull head, but whiles the slow hound puzzles
out the scent--go to, And I do think you and I ha' got hold of two ends
o' one stick, and a main foul one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>Jorian then, after some of those useless preliminaries men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) class
always deal in, came to the point of the story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had been employed by
the burgomaster of Tergou to repair the floor of an upper room in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
house, and when it was almost done, Coming suddenly to fetch away his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
tools, curiosity had been excited by some loud words below, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had
lain down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) stomach, and heard the burgomaster talking about a
letter which Cornelis and Sybrandt were minded to convey into the place
of one that a certain Hans Memling was taking to Gerard; <div class="bookquote">``and it seems
their will was good, but their stomach was small; so to give them
courage the old man showed them a drawer full of silver, and if they did
the trick they should each put a hand in, and have all the silver they
could hold in't. Well, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>continued Jorian, <div class="bookquote">``I thought not much
on't at the time, except for the bargain itself, that kept me awake
mostly all night. Think on't! Next morning at peep of day who should I
see but my masters Cornelis and Sybrandt come out of their house each
with a black eye. `Oho,' says I, `what yon Hans hath put his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) mark on ye;
well now I hope that is all you have got for your pains.' Didn't they
make for the burgomaster's house? I to my hiding-place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>At this part of Jorian's revelation the monk's nostril dilated, and his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>)
restless eye showed the suspense he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) was in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div>continued Jorian, <div class="bookquote">``the burgomaster brought them into
that same room. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand; but I am no scholar;
however, I have got as many eyes in my head as the Pope hath, and I saw
the drawer opened, and those two knaves put in each a hand and draw it
out full. And, saints in glory, how they tried to hold more, and more,
and more o' yon stuff! And Sybrandt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had daubed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) hand in something
sticky, I think `twas glue, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) made shift to carry one or two pieces
away a sticking to the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)! `Tis a sin to
laugh. So you see luck was on the wrong side as usual; they had done
the trick; but how they did it, that, methinks, will never be known till
doomsday. Go to, they left their immortal jewels in yon drawer. Well,
they got a handful of silver for them; the devil had the worst o' yon
bargain. There, father, that is off my mind; often I longed to tell it
some one, but I durst not to the women; or Margaret would not have had
a friend left in the world; for those two black-hearted villains are the
favourites, `Tis always so. Have not the old folk just taken a brave new
shop for them in this very town, in the Hoog Straet? There may you see
their sign, a gilt sheep and a lambkin; a brace of wolves sucking their
dam would be nigher the mark. And there the whole family feast this day;
oh, `tis a fine world. What, not a word, holy father; you sit there like
stone, and have not even a curse to bestow on them, the stony-hearted
miscreants. What, was it not enough the poor lad was all alone in a
strange land; must his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own flesh and blood go and lie away the one
blessing his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) enemies had left him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)? And then think of her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) pining and
pining all these years, and sitting at the window looking adown the
street for Gerard! and so constant, so tender, and true: my wife says
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is sure no woman ever loved a man truer than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loves the lad those
villains have parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and the day never passes but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) weeps
salt tears for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). And when I think, that, but for those two greedy
lying knaves, yon winsome lad, whose life I saved, might be by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side
this day the happiest he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) in Holland; and the sweet lass, that saved my
life, might be sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cheek upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sweetheart's shoulder,
the happiest she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in Holland in place of the saddest; oh, I thirst for
their blood, the nasty, sneaking, lying, cogging, cowardly, heartless,
bowelless--how now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>The monk started wildly up, livid with fury and despair, and rushed
headlong from the place with both hands clenched and raised on high.
So terrible was this inarticulate burst of fury, that Jorian's puny ire
died out at sight of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) stood looking dismayed after the human
tempest he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) had launched.

<p/>While thus absorbed he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) arm grasped by a small, tremulous hand.

<p/>It was Margaret Brandt.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) started; her (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) coming there just then seemed so strange. She (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) had waited
long on Peter's tombstone, but the friar did not come, So she (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) went into
the church to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) was there still. She (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) could not find him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>).

<p/>Presently, going up the south aisle, the gigantic shadow of a friar came
rapidly along the floor and part of a pillar, and seemed to pass through
her (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) was near screaming; but in a moment remembered Jorian's shadow
had come in so from the churchyard; and tried to clamber out the nearest
way. She (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) did so, but with some difficulty; and by that time Clement was
just disappearing down the street; yet, so expressive at times is the
body as well as the face, she (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) could see he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was greatly agitated. Jorian
and she (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) looked at one another, and at the wild figure of the distant
friar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) to Jorian, trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you startled me. How come you here of all people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this a time for idle chat? What said he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to you? He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has been speaking
to you; deny it not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Girl, as I stand here, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) asked me whereabout you were buried in this
churchyard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), nowhere, thank Heaven: you were alive and saving other folk
from the churchyard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the long and the short is, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) knew thy Gerard in Italy; and a
letter came saying you were dead; and it broke thy poor lad's heart. Let
me see; who was the letter written by? Oh, by the demoiselle van
Eyck. That was his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) way of it. But I up and told him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) nay; `twas neither
demoiselle nor dame that penned yon lie, but Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, and
those foul knaves, Cornelis and Sybrandt; these changed the true letter
for one of their own; I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) as how I saw the whole villainy done
through a chink; and now, if I have not been and told you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, cruel! cruel! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) lives. The fear of fears is gone. Thank God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, lass; and as for thine enemies, I have given them a dig. For yon
friar is friendly to Gerard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is gone to Eli's house, methinks.
For I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) where to find Gerard's enemies and thine, and wow but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
will give them their lesson. If ever a man was mad with rage, its yon.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned black and white, and parted like a stone from a sling. Girl,
there was thunder in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye and silence on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips. Made me cold a
did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jorian, what have you done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Quick! quick! help me
thither, for the power is gone all out of my body. You know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not as
I do. Oh, if you had seen the blow he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave Ghysbrecht; and heard the
frightful crash! Come, save him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from worse mischief. The water is deep
enow; but not bloody yet, come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) accents were so full of agony that Jorian sprang out of the grave
and came with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), huddling on his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) jerkin as he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) went.

<p/>But as they hurried along, he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) what on earth she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) meant? <div class="bookquote">``I talk
of this friar, and you answer me of Gerard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Man, see you not, this is Gerard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This, Gerard? what mean ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, yon friar is my boy's father. I have waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) long,
Jorian. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) is come to me at last. And thank God for it. Oh, my
poor child! Quicker, Jorian, quicker!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, thou art mad as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Stay! By St. Bavon, yon was Gerard's face;
`twas nought like it; yet somehow--`twas it. Come on! come on! let me
see the end of this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The end? How many of us will live to see that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hoog Straet</b></font>)</div><p/>They hurried along in breathless silence, till they reached Hoog Straet.

<p/>Then Jorian tried to reassure her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are making your own trouble,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``who says he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) has gone thither? more likely to the convent to
weep and pray, poor soul. Oh, cursed, cursed villains!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did not you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) where those villains bide?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then quicker, oh, Jorian, quicker. I see the house. Thank God and all
the saints, I shall be in time to calm him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). I know what I'll say to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>);
Heaven forgive me! Poor Catherine; `tis of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) I think: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has been a
mother to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The shop was a corner house, with two doors; one in the main street, for
customers, and a house-door round the corner.

<p/>Margaret and Jorian were now within twenty yards of the shop, when they
heard a roar inside, like as of some wild animal, and the friar burst
out, white and raging, and went tearing down the street.

<p/>Margaret screamed, and sank fainting on Jorian's arm.

<p/>Jorian shouted after him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Stay, madman, know thy friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) was
deaf, and went headlong, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) clenched fists high, high in the
air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Help me in, good Jorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>moaned Margaret, turning suddenly calm. <div class="bookquote">``Let
me know the worst; and die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) trembling limbs into the house.

<p/>It seemed unnaturally still; not a sound.

<p/>Jorian's own heart beat fast.

<p/>A door was before him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), unlatched. He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) pushed it softly with his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) left
hand, and Margaret and he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) stood on the threshold.

<p/>What they saw there you shall soon know.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXXVIII

<p/>It was supper-time. Eli's family were collected round the board;
Margaret only was missing. To Catherine's surprise, Eli said he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) would
wait a bit for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) you would not wait for the duke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is not the duke; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is a poor, good lass, that hath waited not
minutes, but years, for a graceless son of mine. You can put the meat
on the board all the same; then we can fall to, without farther loss o'
time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) does come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>The smoking dishes smelt so savoury that Eli gave way. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will come if
we begin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``they always do, Come, sit ye down, Mistress Joan;
y’are not here for a slave, I trow, but a guest. There, I hear a quick
step off covers, and fall to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The covers were withdrawn, and the knives brandished.

<p/>Then burst into the room, not the expected Margaret, but a Dominican
friar, livid with rage.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) was at the table in a moment, in front of Cornelis and Sybrandt,
threw his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) tall body over the narrow table, and with two hands hovering
above their shrinking heads, like eagles over a quarry, he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) cursed
them by name, soul and body, in this world and the next. It was an age
eloquent in curses; and this curse was so full, so minute, so blighting,
blasting, withering, and tremendous, that I am afraid to put all the
words on paper. <div class="bookquote">``Cursed be the lips,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) shrieked, <div class="bookquote">``which spoke the
lie that Margaret was dead; may they rot before the grave, and kiss
white-hot iron in hell thereafter; doubly cursed be the hands that
changed those letters, and be they struck off by the hangman's knife,
and handle hell fire for ever; thrice accursed be the cruel hearts
that did conceive that damned lie, to part true love for ever; may they
sicken and wither on earth joyless, loveless, hopeless; and wither to
dust before their time; and burn in eternal fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) cursed the meat
at their mouths and every atom of their bodies, from their hair to the
soles of their feet. Then turning from the cowering, shuddering pair,
who had almost hid themselves beneath the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) tore a letter out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) bosom, and flung it down before his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read that, thou hard old man, that didst imprison thy son, read, and
see what monsters thou hast brought into the world, The memory of my
wrongs and hers dwell with you all for ever! I will meet you again at
the judgment day; on earth ye will never see me more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And in a moment, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) had come, so he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) was gone, leaving them stiff, and
cold, and white as statues round the smoking board.

<p/>And this was the sight that greeted Margaret's eyes and Jorian's--pale
figures of men and women petrified around the untasted food, as Eastern
poets feigned.

<p/>Margaret glanced her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eye round, and gasped out, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, joy! all here; no
blood hath been shed. Oh, you cruel, cruel men! I thank God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hath not
slain you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>At sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) Catherine gave an eloquent scream; then turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head
away. But Eli, who had just cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) eye over the false letter, and
begun to understand it all, seeing the other victim come in at that very
moment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wrongs reflected in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sweet, pale face, started to his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>)
feet in a transport of rage, and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Stand clear, and let me get
at the traitors, I'll hang for them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the victim</b></font>)</div>And in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) whipped out his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>)
short sword, and fell upon them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>screamed Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Fly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They slipped howling under the table, and crawled out the other side.

<p/>But ere they could get to the door, the furious old man ran round and
intercepted them. Catherine only screamed and wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands; your
notables are generally useless at such a time; and blood would certainly
have flowed, but Margaret and Jorian seized the fiery old man's arms,
and held them with all their might, whilst the pair got clear of the
house; then they let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went vainly raging after them out
into the street.

<p/>They were a furlong off, running like hares.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hacked down the board on which their names were written, and brought
it indoors, and flung it into the chimney-place. Catherine was sitting
rocking herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head. Joan had run to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>)
husband. Margaret had her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms round Catherine's neck; and pale and
panting, was yet making efforts to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>But it was not to be done, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my poor children!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
miserable mother! `Tis a mercy Kate was ill upstairs. There, I have
lived to thank God for that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried, with a fresh burst of sobs. ``It
would have killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had better have stayed in Italy, as come home
to curse his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own flesh and blood and set us all by the ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, hold your chat, woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>cried Eli angrily; <div class="bookquote">``you are still on the
side of the ill-doer, You are cheap served; your weakness made the
rogues what they are; I was for correcting them in their youth: for
sore ills, sharp remedies; but you still sided with their faults, and
undermined me, and baffled wise severity. And you, Margaret, leave
comforting her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) that ought rather to comfort you; for what is her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hurt
to yours? But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) never had a grain of justice under her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) skin; and never
will. So come thou to me, that am thy father from this hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a command; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) kissed Catherine, and went tottering to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) on a chair beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) feeble head on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) honest breast; but not a tear: it was too deep for that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor lamb,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>). After a while--<div class="bookquote">``Come, good folks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said true Eli,
in a broken voice, to Jorian and Joan, <div class="bookquote">``we are in a little trouble, as
you see; but that is no reason you should starve. For our Lady's sake,
fall to; and add not to my grief the reputation of a churl. What the
dickens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>), with a sudden ghastly attempt at stout-heartedness,
<div class="bookquote">``the more knaves I have the luck to get shut of, the more my need of
true men and women, to help me clear the dish, and cheer mine eye with
honest faces about me where else were gaps. Fall to, I do entreat ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine, sobbing, backed his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) request. Poor, simple, antique,
hospitable souls! Jorian, whose appetite, especially since his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) illness,
was very keen, was for acting on this hospitable invitation; but Joan
whispered a word in his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) ear, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) instantly drew back, <div class="bookquote">``Nay, I'll
touch no meat that Holy Church hath cursed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In sooth, I forgot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div>said Eli apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``My son, who was reared
at my table, hath cursed my victuals. That seems strange. Well, what God
wills, man must bow to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The supper was flung out into the yard.

<p/>Jorian took his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) wife home, and heavy sadness reigned in Eli's house that
night.

<p/>Meantime, where was Clement?

<p/>Lying at full length upon the floor of the convent church, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) lips
upon the lowest step of the altar, in an indescribable state of terror,
misery, penitence, and self-abasement: through all which struggled
gleams of joy that Margaret was alive.

<p/>Night fell and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) lying there weeping and praying; and morning
would have found him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) there too; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) suddenly remembered that,
absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) own wrongs and Margaret's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had committed another sin
besides intemperate rage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had neglected a dying man.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) rose instantly, groaning at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) accumulated wickedness, and set out
to repair the omission. The weather had changed; it was raining hard,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) got clear of the town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) heard the wolves baying; they were
on the foot, But Clement was himself again, or nearly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) thought little
of danger or discomfort, having a shameful omission of religious duty to
repair: he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) went stoutly forward through rain and darkness.

<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) went, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) often beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) breast, and cried, <div class="bookquote">``MEA CULPA! MEA
CULPA!''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXXIX

<p/>What that sensitive mind, and tender conscience, and loving heart, and
religious soul, went through even in a few hours, under a situation so
sudden and tremendous, is perhaps beyond the power of words to paint.

<p/>Fancy yourself the man; and then put yourself in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place! Were I to
write a volume on it, we should have to come to that at last.

<p/>I shall relate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next two overt acts. They indicate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) state of mind
after the first fierce tempest of the soul had subsided. After
spending the night with the dying hermit in giving and receiving holy
consolations, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set out not for Rotterdam, but for Tergou. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went
there to confront his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fatal enemy the burgomaster, and by means of that
parchment, whose history, by-the-by was itself a romance, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
disgorge; and give Margaret her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own.

<p/>Heated and dusty, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped at the fountain, and there began to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
black bread and drink of the water. But in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) frugal meal
a female servant came running, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to come and shrive her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
dying master, He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned the bread to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wallet, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
without a word.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--to the Stadthouse.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew back with a little shudder when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) go in.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost instantly recovered himself, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) into the
house, and up the stairs. And there in bed, propped up by pillows, lay
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deadly enemy, looking already like a corpse.

<p/>Clement eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) a moment from the door, and thought of all the tower,
the wood, the letter. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) said in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Pax vobiscum!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
trembled a little while he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) said it.

<p/>The sick man welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as eagerly as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) weak state permitted. <div class="bookquote">``Thank
Heaven, thou art come in time to absolve me from my sins, father, and
pray for my soul, thou and thy brethren.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement, <div class="bookquote">``before absolution cometh confession. In which
act there must be no reservation, as thou valuest thy soul's weal.
Bethink thee, therefore, wherein thou hast most offended God and the
Church, while I offer up a prayer for wisdom to direct thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement then kneeled and prayed; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) knees, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
said to Ghysbrecht, with apparent calmness, <div class="bookquote">``My son, confess thy sins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the sick man, <div class="bookquote">``they are many and great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great, then, be thy penitence, my son; so shalt thou find God's mercy
great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>Ghysbrecht put his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) hands together, and began to confess with every
appearance of contrition.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) owned he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) had eaten meat in mid-Lent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) had often absented himself
from mass on the Lord's day, and saints' days; and had trifled with
other religious observances, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) enumerated with scrupulous
fidelity.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had done, the friar said quietly, ```Tis well, my son, These be
faults. Now to thy crimes, Thou hadst done better to begin with them.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, father, what crimes lie to my account if these be none?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I confessing to thee, or thou to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement somewhat
severely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, father! Why, surely, I to you. But I know not what you call
crimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The seven deadly sins, art thou clear of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forefend I should be guilty of them. I know them not by name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Many do them all that cannot name them. Begin with that one which leads
to lying, theft, and murder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quit of that one, any way. How call you it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``AVARICE, my son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Avarice? Oh, as to that, I have been a saving man all my day; but I
have kept a good table, and not altogether forgotten the poor. But,
alas, I am a great sinner, Mayhap the next will catch me, What is the
next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have not yet done with this one. Bethink thee, the Church is not to
be trifled with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! am I in a condition to trifle with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) now? Avarice? Avarice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) looked puzzled and innocent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hast thou ever robbed the fatherless?''  (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>inquired the friar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me? robbed the fatherless?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>gasped Ghysbrecht; <div class="bookquote">``not that I mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once more, my son, I am forced to tell thee thou art trifling with the
Church. Miserable man! another evasion, and I leave thee, and fiends
will straightway gather round thy bed, and tear thee down to the
bottomless pit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, leave me not! leave me not!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>shrieked the terrified old man. <div class="bookquote">``The
Church knows all. I must have robbed the fatherless. I will confess. Who
shall I begin with? My memory for names is shaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The defence was skilful, but in this case failed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hast thou forgotten Floris Brandt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement stonily.

<p/>The sick man reared himself in bed in a pitiable state of terror. <div class="bookquote">``How
knew you that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Church knows many things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement coldly, <div class="bookquote">``and by many ways
that are dark to thee, Miserable impenitent, you called her (<font color='blue'><b>fiends</b></font>) to your
side, hoping to deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>fiends</b></font>), You said, `I will not confess to the cure
but to some friar who knows not my misdeeds. So will I cheat the Church
on my deathbed, and die as I have lived,' But God, kinder to thee than
thou art to thyself, sent to thee one whom thou couldst not deceive. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
has tried thee; He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was patient with thee, and warned thee not to trifle
with Holy Church; but all is in vain; thou canst not confess; for thou
art impenitent as a stone. Die, then, as thou hast lived. Methinks I see
the fiends crowding round the bed for their prey. They wait but for me
to go. And I go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) back; but Ghysbrecht, in extremity of terror, caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
by the frock. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, holy man, mercy! stay. I will confess all, all. I
robbed my friend Floris, Alas! would it had ended there; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) lost
little by me; but I kept the land from Peter his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) son, and from Margaret,
Peter's daughter. Yet I was always going to give it back; but I
couldn't, I couldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Avarice, my son, avarice, Happy for thee `tis not too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I will leave it her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) by will. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) will not have long to wait for it
now; not above a month or two at farthest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For which month's possession thou wouldst damn thy soul for ever, Thou
fool!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The sick man groaned, and prayed the friar to be reasonable.

<p/>The friar firmly, but gently and persuasively, persisted, and with
infinite patience detached the dying man's gripe from another's
property. There were times when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patience was tried, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on
the point of thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom and producing the deed,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had brought for that purpose; but after yesterday's outbreak
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guard against choler; and to conclude, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conquered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
impatience; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conquered a personal repugnance to the man, so strong
as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own flesh creep all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was struggling with this
miser for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul; and at last, without a word about the deed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to make full and prompt restitution.

<p/>How the restitution was made will be briefly related elsewhere: also
certain curious effects produced upon Ghysbrecht by it; and when and on
what terms Ghysbrecht and Clement parted.

<p/>I promised to relate two acts of the latter, indicative of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) mind.

<p/>This is one. The other is told in two words.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was quite sure Margaret had her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own, and was a rich
woman--

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) disappeared.



<p/>CHAPTER XC

<p/>It was the day after that terrible scene: the little house in the
Hoog Straet was like a grave, and none more listless and dejected than
Catherine, so busy and sprightly by nature, After dinner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes red
with weeping, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went to the convent to try and soften Gerard, and lay
the first stone at least of a reconciliation.

<p/>It was some time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could make the porter understand whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
was seeking. Eventually she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) learned he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had left late last night, and was
not expected back, She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went sighing with the news to Margaret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sitting idle, like one with whom life had lost its savour; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy clasped so tight in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had left, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) feared some one would take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) too. Catherine begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to come to
the Hoog Straet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>sighed Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``You cannot but say to yourselves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is
the cause of all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``we are not so ill-hearted, and Eli is so
fond on you; you will maybe soften him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you think I can do any good, I'll come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, with a
weary sigh.

<p/>They found Eli and a carpenter putting up another name in place of
Cornelis and Sybrandt's; and what should that name be but Margaret
Brandt's.

<p/>With all her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) affection for Margaret, this went through poor Catherine
like a knife. <div class="bookquote">``The bane of one is another's meat,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) make me spend the money unjustly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>replied Margaret coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a good soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Ay, so best, sith he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) is the
strongest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day Giles dropped in, and Catherine told the story all in
favour of the black sheep, and invited his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) pity for them, anathematized
by their brother, and turned on the wide world by their father. But
Giles's prejudices ran the other way; he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) out, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
bluntly the knaves had got off cheap; they deserved to be hanged at
Margaret's door into the bargain, and dismissing them with contempt,
crowed with delight at the return of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) favourite. <div class="bookquote">``I'll show him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what `tis to have a brother at court with a heart to serve a
friend, and a head to point the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless thee, Giles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>murmured Margaret softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou wast ever his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) stanch friend, dear Giles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said little Kate; <div class="bookquote">``but
alack, I know not what thou canst do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Giles had left them, and all was sad and silent again, when a
well-dressed man opened the door softly, and asked was Margaret Brandt
here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D’ye hear, lass? You are wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine briskly. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) the
Gossip was indestructible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret listlessly, <div class="bookquote">``and here I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>A shuffling of feet was heard at the door, and a colourless, feeble old
man was assisted into the room. It was Ghysbrecht Van Swieten. At
sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>) Catherine shrieked, and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head, and
Margaret shuddered violently, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head swiftly away, not to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Swieten</b></font>).

<p/>A feeble voice issued from the strange visitor's lips, <div class="bookquote">``Good people, a
dying man hath come to ask your forgiveness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to look on your work, you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, taking down her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
apron and bursting out sobbing. <div class="bookquote">``There, there, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is fainting; look to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Eli, quick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, in a feeble voice, <div class="bookquote">``the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) gave me a
turn, that is all, Prithee, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) say his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) say, and go; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) is the
murderer of me and mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>said Ghysbrecht, <div class="bookquote">``I am too feeble to say it standing and no one
biddeth me sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli, who had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) into the house, interfered here, and said,
half sullenly, half apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``Well, burgomaster, `tis not our
wont to leave a visitor standing whiles we sit. But man, man, you have
wrought us too much ill.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And the honest fellow's voice began to shake
with anger he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fought hard to contain, because it was his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own house.

<p/>Then Ghysbrecht found an advocate in one who seldom spoke in vain in
that family.

<p/>It was little Kate. <div class="bookquote">``Father, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``my duty to you, but
this is not well. Death squares all accounts, And see you not death in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) face? I shall not live long, good friends; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) time is shorter
than mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Eli made haste and set a chair for their dying enemy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) own hands.
Ghysbrecht's attendants put him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) into it. <div class="bookquote">``Go fetch the boxes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>).
They brought in two boxes, and then retired, leaving their master alone
in the family he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had so cruelly injured.

<p/>Every eye was now bent on him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), except Margaret's. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) undid the boxes
with unsteady fingers, and brought out of one the title-deeds of a
property at Tergou. <div class="bookquote">``This land and these houses belonged to Floris
Brandt, and do belong to thee of right, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) granddaughter. These I did
usurp for a debt long since defrayed with interest. These I now restore
their rightful owner with penitent tears. In this other box are three
hundred and forty golden angels, being the rent and fines I have
received from that land more than Floris Brandt's debt to me, I have
kept it compt, still meaning to be just one day; but Avarice withheld
me, pray, good people, against temptation! I was not born dishonest: yet
you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``And you the burgomaster! Hast
whipt good store of thieves in thy day. However,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), on second
thoughts, ```tis better late than never, What, Margaret, art deaf? The
good man hath brought thee back thine own. Art a rich woman. Alack, what
a mountain o' gold!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) keep land and gold, and give me back my Gerard, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) stole
from me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) treason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head still averted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div>said Ghysbrecht, <div class="bookquote">``would I could, what I can I have done. Is it
nought? It cost me a sore struggle; and I rose from my last bed to do it
myself, lest some mischance should come between her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ghysbrecht/Ghysbrecht Van Swieten/Van Swieten</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``since thou, whose idol is pelf, hast done
this, God and the saints will, as I hope, forgive thee. As for me, I am
neither saint nor angel, but only a poor woman, whose heart thou hast
broken, Speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>), Kate, for I am like the dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Kate meditated a little while; and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) soft silvery voice fell
like a soothing melody upon the air, <div class="bookquote">``My poor sister hath a sorrow that
riches cannot heal, Give her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) time, Ghysbrecht; `tis not in nature she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
should forgive thee all. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) boy is fatherless; and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is neither maid,
wife, nor widow; and the blow fell but two days syne, that laid her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
heart a bleeding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>A single heavy sob from Margaret was the comment to these words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Therefore, give her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) time! And ere thou diest, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will forgive thee
all, ay, even to pleasure me, that haply shall not be long behind thee,
Ghysbrecht. Meantime, we, whose wounds be sore, but not so deep as hers,
do pardon thee, a penitent and a dying man; and I, for one, will pray
for thee from this hour; go in peace!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their little oracle had spoken; it was enough. Eli even invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>)
to break a manchet and drink a stoup of wine to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) heart for his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>)
journey.

<p/>But Ghysbrecht declined, and said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) had done was a cordial to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``Man seeth but a little way before him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>), neighbour. This land I clung
so to it was a bed of nettles to me all the time. `Tis gone; and I feel
happier and livelier like for the loss on't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) men, and they lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) into the litter.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) was gone Catherine gloated over the money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had never seen
so much together, and was almost angry with Margaret, for <div class="bookquote">``sitting out
there like an image.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dilated on the advantages of money.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) teased Margaret till at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) prevailed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to come and
look at it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better let her (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) be, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>said Kate, <div class="bookquote">``How can she (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) relish gold, with a
heart in her (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) bosom liker lead?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Little Kate</b></font>)</div>But Catherine persisted.

<p/>The result was, Margaret looked down at all her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wealth with wondering
eyes. Then suddenly wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands and cried with piercing anguish,
<div class="bookquote">``TOO LATE! TOO LATE!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And shook off her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) leaden despondency, only to go
into strong hysterics over the wealth that came too late to be shared
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) loved.

<p/>A little of this gold, a portion of this land, a year or two ago, when
it was as much her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own as now; and Gerard would have never left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) side
for Italy or any other place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too late! Too late!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XCI

<p/>Not many days after this came the news that Margaret Van Eyck was dead
and buried. By a will she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) had made a year before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) left all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>)
property, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) funeral expenses and certain presents to Reicht
Heynes, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) dear daughter Margaret Brandt, requesting her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) to keep
Reicht as long as unmarried.

<p/>By this will Margaret inherited a furnished house, and pictures and
sketches that in the present day would be a fortune: among the pictures
was one she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) valued more than a gallery of others.

<p/>It represented <div class="bookquote">``A Betrothal.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>The solemnity of the ceremony was marked
in the grave face of the man, and the demure complacency of the woman.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was painted almost entirely by Margaret Van Eyck, but the rest
of the picture by Jan.. The accessories were exquisitely finished, and
remain a marvel of skill to this day. Margaret Brandt sent word to
Reicht to stay in the house till such time as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) could find the heart
to put foot in it, and miss the face and voice that used to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>)
there; and to take special care of the picture <div class="bookquote">``in the little cubboord:''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>meaning the diptych.

<p/>The next thing was, Luke Peterson came home, and heard that Gerard was a
monk.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was like to go mad with joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) came to Margaret, and said--<div class="bookquote">``heed,
mistress. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) cannot marry you I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is a friar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) was my husband, and my boy's father long ere he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a friar. And I
have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>Luke was thoroughly puzzled. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I have
got a cousin a lawyer. I'll go and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) whether you are married or
single.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I shall ask my own heart, not a lawyer. So that is your regard for
me; to go making me the town talk, oh, fie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is done already without a word from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not by such as seek my respect. And if you do it, never come nigh
me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke, with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``you are like a dove to all the rest; but
you are a hardhearted tyrant to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis your own fault, dear Luke, for wooing me. That is what lets me
from being as kind to you as I desire, Luke, my bonny lad, listen to
me. I am rich now; I can make my friends happy, though not myself. Look
round the street, look round the parish. There is many a quean in it
fairer than I twice told, and not spoiled with weeping. Look high; and
take your choice. Speak you to the lass herself, and I'll speak to the
mother; they shall not say thee nay; take my word for't.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see what ye mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said Luke, turning very red. <div class="bookquote">``But if I can't have
your liking, I will none o' your money. I was your servant when you were
poor as I; and poorer. No; if you would liever be a friar's leman than
an honest man's wife, you are not the woman I took you for: so part we
withouten malice: seek you your comfort on yon road, where never a she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
did find it yet, and for me, I'll live and die a bachelor. Good even,
mistress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Farewell, dear Luke; and God forgive you for saying that to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>For some days Margaret dreaded, almost as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) desired, the
coming interview with Gerard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder not he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
keeps away a while; for so should I.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would hear he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was
a father; and the desire to see their boy would overcome everything.
<div class="bookquote">``And,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the poor girl to herself, <div class="bookquote">``if so be that meeting does not
kill me, I feel I shall be better after it than I am now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>But when day after day went by, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was not heard of, a freezing
suspicion began to crawl and creep towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind. What if his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) absence
was intentional? What if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had gone to some cold-blooded monks his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
fellows, and they had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) never to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more? The convent had
ere this shown itself as merciless to true lovers as the grave itself.

<p/>At this thought the very life seemed to die out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/>And now for the first time deep indignation mingled at times with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
grief and apprehension. <div class="bookquote">``Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) have ever loved me? To run from me and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) boy without a word! Why, this poor Luke thinks more of me than he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>While her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind was in this state, Giles came roaring. <div class="bookquote">``I've hit the
clout; our Gerard is Vicar of Gouda.''


 (<font color='red'><b>the dwarf</b></font>)</div><p/>A very brief sketch of the dwarf's court life will suffice to prepare
the reader for his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) own account of this feat. Some months before he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) went
to court his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) intelligence had budded. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) himself dated the change from
a certain 8th of June, when, swinging by one hand along with the week's
washing on a tight rope in the drying ground, something went crack
inside his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) head; and lo! intellectual powers unchained. At court his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
shrewdness and bluntness of speech, coupled with his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) gigantic voice and
his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) small stature, made him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) a Power: without the last item I fear they
would have conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) to that unpopular gymnasium, the gallows. The
young Duchess of Burgundy, and Marie the heiress apparent, both petted
him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), as great ladies have petted dwarfs in all ages; and the court poet
melted butter by the six-foot rule, and poured enough of it down his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>)
back to stew Goliah in. He (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) even amplified, versified, and enfeebled
certain rough and ready sentences dictated by Giles.

<p/>The centipedal prolixity that resulted went to Eli by letter, thus
entitled--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The high and puissant Princess Marie
of Bourgogne her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lytel jantilman hys
complaynt of y' Coort, and
praise of a rusticall lyfe, versificated, and empapyred
by me the lytel jantilman's right lovynge
and obsequious servitor, etc.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eli</b></font>)</div><p/>But the dwarf reached his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) climax by a happy mixture of mind and muscle;
thus:

<p/>The day before a grand court joust he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) challenged the Duke's giant to
a trial of strength. This challenge made the gravest grin, and aroused
expectation.

<p/>Giles had a lofty pole planted ready, and at the appointed hour went up
it like a squirrel, and by strength of arm made a right angle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
body, and so remained: then slid down so quickly, that the high and
puissant princess squeaked, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hands, not to see
the demise of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) pocket-Hercules.

<p/>The giant effected only about ten feet, then looked ruefully up and
ruefully down, and descended, bathed in perspiration to argue the
matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not the dwarf's greater strength, but his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) smaller body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The spectators</b></font>)</div><p/>The spectators received this excuse with loud derision. There was the
fact, the dwarf was great at mounting a pole: the giant only great at
excuses. In short Giles had gauged their intellects: with his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) own body
no doubt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``an ye go to that, I'll wrestle ye, my lad, if so be
you will let me blindfold your eyne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The giant, smarting under defeat, and thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) could surely recover
it by this means, readily consented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles, <div class="bookquote">``see you yon blind Samson? At a signal from me he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>)
shall make me a low obeisance, and unbonnet to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How may that be, being blinded?''  (<font color='red'><b>a maid</b></font>)</div>inquired a maid of honour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll wager on Giles for one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>When several wagers were laid pro and con, Giles hit the giant in the
bread-basket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) went double -LRB-the obeisance-RRB-, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) bonnet fell off.

<p/>The company yelled with delight at this delicate stroke of wit, and
Giles took to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) heels. The giant followed as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) could recover
his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) breath and tear off his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) bandage. But it was too late; Giles had
prepared a little door in the wall, through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) could pass, but not
a giant, and had coloured it so artfully, it looked like a wall; this
door he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) tore open, and went headlong through, leaving no vestige but
this posy, written very large upon the reverse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) trick door--

<p/>Long limbs, big body, panting wit
By wee and wise is bet and bit

<p/>After this Giles became a Force.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) shall now speak for himself.

<p/>Finding Margaret unable to believe the good news, and sceptical as to
the affairs of Holy Church being administered by dwarfs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) narrated as
follows:

<p/>``When the princess sent for me to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) bedroom as of custom, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
out of languor, I came not mirthful nor full of country dicts, as is my
wont, but dull as lead.

<p/>```Why, what aileth thee?' quo' she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>). `Art sick?' `At heart,' quo' I.
`Alas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) is in love,' quo' she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>). Whereat five brazen hussies, which they
call them maids of honour, did giggle loud. `Not so mad as that,' said
I, `seeing what I see at court of women folk.'

<p/>```There, ladies,' quo' the princess, `best let him (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) a be. `Tis a liberal
mannikin, and still giveth more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) taketh of saucy words.'

<p/>```In all sadness,' quo' she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), `what is the matter?'

<p/>``I told her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) I was meditating, and what perplexed me was, that other folk
could now and then keep their word, but princes never.

<p/>```Heyday,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), `thy shafts fly high this morn.' I told her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), `Ay,
for they hit the Truth.'

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said I was as keen as keen; but it became not me to put riddles to
her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), nor her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to answer them. `Stand aloof a bit, mesdames,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>),
`and thou speak withouten fear;' for she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) saw I was in sad earnest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I began to quake a bit; for mind ye, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) can doff freedom and don
dignity quicker than she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) can slip out of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) dressing-gown into kirtle
of state. But I made my voice so soft as honey -LRB-wherefore smilest?-RRB-, and
I said `Madam, one evening, a matter of five years agone, as ye sat
with your mother, the Countess of Charolois, who is now in heaven, worse
luck, you wi' your lute, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) tapestry, or the like, do ye
mind there came came into ye a fair youth with a letter from a painter
body, one Margaret Van Eyck?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyck</b></font>) did, `Was it not a tall youth, exceeding
comely?'

<p/>```Ay, madam,' said I; `he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) was my brother.'

<p/>```Your brother?' said she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), and did eye me like all over, -LRB-What dost
smile at?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/>``So I told her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) all that passed between her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) and Gerard, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) was
for giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a bishopric; but the good countess said, `Gently, Marie!
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is too young; and with that they did both promise him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) a living:
`Yet,' said I, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hath been a priest a long while, and no living. Hence
my bile.'

<p/>```Alas!' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), `'tis not by my good will; for all this thou hast said
is sooth, and more. I do remember my dear mother said to me, ``See thou
to it if I be not here.''' So then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried out, `Ay, dear mother, no
word of thine shall ever fall to the ground.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so ripe, said quickly, `Madam, the Vicar of Gouda died
last week.' -LRB-For when ye seek favours of the great, behoves ye know the
very thing ye aim at.-RRB-

<p/>```Then thy brother is vicar of Gouda,' quo' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), `so sure as I am
heiress of Burgundy and the Netherlands. Nay, thank me not, good Giles,'
quo' she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>), `but my good mother. And I do thank thee for giving of me
somewhat to do for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) memory. And doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fall a weeping for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
mother? And doesn't that set me off a-snivelling for my good brother
that I love so dear, and to think that a poor little elf like me could
yet speak in the ear of princes, and make my beautiful brother vicar of
Gouda; eh, lass, it is a bonny place, and a bonny manse, and hawthorn in
every bush at spring-tide, and dog-roses and eglantine in every summer
hedge. I know what the poor fool affects, leave that to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The dwarf</b></font>)</div><p/>The dwarf began his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) narrative strutting to and fro before Margaret, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) ended it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not contain herself, but caught
him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>), and embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) warmly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Giles,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, blushing, and
kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I cannot keep my hands off thee, thy body it is so little,
and thy heart so great. Thou art his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) true friend. Bless thee! bless
thee! bless thee! Now we shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) again. We have not set eyes on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) since that terrible day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gramercy, but that is strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) is ashamed of
having cursed those two vagabones, being our own flesh and blood, worse
luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think you that is why he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) hides?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret eagerly;

<p/>``Ay, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) is hiding at all. However, I'll cry him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) by bellman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, that might much offend him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What care I? Is Gouda to go vicarless and the manse in nettles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>And to Margaret's secret satisfaction, Giles had the new vicar cried in
Rotterdam and the neighbouring towns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) easily persuaded Margaret that
in a day or two Gerard would be sure to hear, and come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) benefice.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) manse, and thought how comfortable it might be
made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and how dearly she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) should love to do it.

<p/>But the days rolled on, and Gerard came neither to Rotterdam nor Gouda.
Giles was mortified, Margaret indignant, and very wretched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said to
herself, <div class="bookquote">``Thinking me dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) comes home, and now, because I am alive,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) goes back to Italy, for that is where he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) has gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Joan advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) to consult the hermit of Gouda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) is dead by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yon one, belike. But the cave is never long void; Gouda ne’er wants a
hermit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>But Margaret declined to go again to Gouda on such an errand, <div class="bookquote">``What can
he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) know, shut up in a cave? less than I, belike. Gerard hath gone back
t' Italy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hates me for not being dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Presently a Tergovian came in with a word from Catherine that Ghysbrecht
Van Swieten had seen Gerard later than any one else. On this Margaret
determined to go and see the house and goods that had been left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and
take Reicht Heynes home to Rotterdam. And as may be supposed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) steps
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) first to Ghysbrecht's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) garden,
seated in a chair with wheels. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with a feeble voice, but
cordially; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) whether it was true he (<font color='blue'><b>Ghysbrecht</b></font>) had seen
Gerard since the fifth of August, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Gerard no more, but Friar
Clement. Ay, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>); and blessed be the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) entered my house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then related in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own words his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) interview with Clement.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), moreover, that the friar had afterwards acknowledged he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
came to Tergou with the missing deed in his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) bosom on purpose to make him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
disgorge her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) land; but that finding him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) disposed towards penitence, he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>)
had gone to work the other way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was not this a saint; who came to right thee, but must needs save his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
enemy's soul in the doing it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) question, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) had recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) said, ``I ne’er
suspected such a thing. `Twas only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had been three days with me
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) revealed himself, Listen while I speak my shame and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) praise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), `The land is gone home, and my stomach feels lighter;
but there is another fault that clingeth to me still;' then told I him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
of the letter I had writ at request of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) brethren, I whose place it
was to check them. Said I, `Yon letter was writ to part two lovers, and
the devil aiding, it hath done the foul work. Land and houses I can
give back, but yon mischief is done for ever.' `Nay,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), `not for
ever, but for life. Repent it then while thou livest.' `I shall,' said
I, `but how can God forgive it? I would not,' said I, `were I He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).'

<p/>```Yet will He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) certainly forgive it,' quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); `for He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is ten times more
forgiving than I am, and I forgive thee.' I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); and then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
said softly, but quavering like, `Ghysbrecht, look at me closer. I am
Gerard, the son of Eli.' And I looked, and looked, and at last, lo! it
was Gerard. Verily I had fallen at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feet with shame and contrition,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would not suffer me. `That became not mine years and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), for a
particular fault. I say not I forgive thee without a struggle,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>),
`not being a saint. But these three days thou hast spent in penitence,
I have worn under thy roof in prayer; and I do forgive thee.' Those were
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) very words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret's tears began to flow, for it was in a broken and contrite
voice the old man told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) this unexpected trait in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) Gerard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``And even with that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bade me farewell.

<p/>```My work here is done now,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). I had not the heart to stay him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>);
for let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) forgive me ever so, the sight of me must be wormwood to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) left me in peace, and may a dying man's blessing wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), go
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will. Oh, girl, when I think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wrongs, and thine, and how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hath avenged himself by saving this stained soul of mine, my heart is
broken with remorse, and these old eyes shed tears by night and day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ghysbrecht,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, weeping, <div class="bookquote">``since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hath forgiven thee, I
forgive thee too: what is done, is done; and thou hast let me know this
day that which I had walked the world to hear. But oh, burgomaster, thou
art an understanding man, now help a poor woman, which hath forgiven
thee her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) misery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) then told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) all that had befallen, <div class="bookquote">``And,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``they will not
keep the living for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bids fair to lose that, as well as
break all our hearts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Call my servant,''  (<font color='red'><b>the burgomaster</b></font>)</div>cried the burgomaster, with sudden vigour.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) for a table and writing materials, and dictated letters to
the burgomasters in all the principal towns in Holland, and one to a
Prussian authority, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friend. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) clerk and Margaret wrote them,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) signed them. <div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the matter shall be despatched
throughout Holland by trusty couriers, and as far as Basle in
Switzerland; and fear not, but we will soon have the vicar of Gouda to
his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) village.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went home animated with fresh hopes, and accusing herself of
ingratitude to Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``I value my wealth now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) also made a resolution never to blame his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) conduct till she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) should
hear from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own lips his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reason.

<p/>Not long after her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) return from Tergou a fresh disaster befell.
Catherine, I must premise, had secret interviews with the black sheep,
the very day after they were expelled; and Cornelis followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to
Tergou, and lived there on secret contributions, but Sybrandt chose to
remain in Rotterdam. Ere Catherine left, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked Margaret to lend her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
two gold angels. <div class="bookquote">``For,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``all mine are spent.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Margaret was
delighted to lend them or give them; but the words were scarce out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mouth ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) caught a look of regret and distress on Kate's face,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) saw directly whither her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) money was going. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) gave Catherine the
money, and went and shut herself up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) boy. Now this money was to
last Sybrandt till his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother could make some good excuse for visiting
Rotterdam again, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) would bring the idle dog some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) own
industrious savings.

<p/>But Sybrandt, having gold in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket, thought it inexhaustible: and
being now under no shadow of restraint, led the life of a complete sot;
until one afternoon, in a drunken frolic, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) climbed on the roof of the
stable at the inn he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was carousing in, and proceeded to walk along it, a
feat he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had performed many times when sober. But now his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) unsteady brain
made his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) legs unsteady, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rolled down the roof and fell with a
loud thwack on to an horizontal paling, where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hung a moment in a
semicircle; then toppled over and lay silent on the ground, amidst roars
of laughter from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) boon companions. When they came to pick him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
could not stand; but fell down giggling at each attempt.

<p/>On this they went staggering and roaring down the street with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),
and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at great risk of another fall to the shop in the Hoog
Straet. For he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had babbled his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own shame all over the place.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw Margaret he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hiccupped out, <div class="bookquote">``Here is the doctor that
cures all hurts, a bonny lass.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) also bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) observe he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) no
malice, for he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) a visit sore against his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will. <div class="bookquote">``Wherefore,
prithee send away these drunkards, and let you and me have t'other
glass, to drown all unkindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>All this time Margaret was pale and red by turns at sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) enemy
and at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) insolence; but one of the men whispered what had happened,
and a streaky something in Sybrandt's face arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cannot stand up, say you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A couldn't just now. Try, comrade! Be a man now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a better man than thou,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div>roared Sybrandt. <div class="bookquote">``I'll stand up and fight
ye all for a crown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) started to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet, and instantly rolled into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) attendant's arms
with a piteous groan. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) then began to curse his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) boon companions, and
declare they had stolen away his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) legs. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could feel nothing below the
waist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, poor wretch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned very gravely to the men,
and said, <div class="bookquote">``Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here. And if you have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to this, go on
your knees, for you have spoiled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for life. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will never walk again;
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back is broken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>The drunken man caught these words, and the foolish look of intoxication
fled, and a glare of anguish took its place. <div class="bookquote">``The curse,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) groaned;
<div class="bookquote">``the curse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret and Reicht Heynes carried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carefully, and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the
softest bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must do as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>whispered Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was kind to
Ghysbrecht.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sybrandt</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) opinion was verified, Sybrandt's spine was fatally injured; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay groaning and helpless, fed and tended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had so deeply
injured.

<p/>The news was sent to Tergou, and Catherine came over.

<p/>It was a terrible blow to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) accused herself as the
cause. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, false wife; oh, weak mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I am rightly
punished for my treason to my poor Eli.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat for hours at a time by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bedside rocking herself in silence,
and was never quite herself again; and the first grey hairs began to
come in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) poor head from that hour.

<p/>As for Sybrandt, all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cry was now for Gerard, He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to whine
to Margaret like a suffering hound, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, sweet Margaret, oh, bonny
Margaret, for our Lady's sake find Gerard, and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) take his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) curse
off me. Thou art gentle, thou art good; thou wilt entreat for me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
will refuse thee nought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine shared his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belief that Gerard could cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
entreaties to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), Margaret hardly needed this. The burgomaster and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
agents having failed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) employed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own, and spent money like water.
And among these agents poor Luke enrolled himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) one day
looking very thin, and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) compassionately. On this he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) began
to blubber, and say he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was more miserable than ever; he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) would like to be
good friends again upon almost any terms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret sorrowfully, <div class="bookquote">``why can you not say to
yourself, now I am her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) little brother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is my old, married
sister, worn down with care? Say so, and I will indulge thee, and pet
thee, and make thee happier than a prince.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke savagely, <div class="bookquote">``sooner than keep away from you
altogether. But above all give me something to do. Perchance I may have
better luck this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get me my marriage lines,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, turning sad and gloomy in a
moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is as much as to say, get me him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)! for where they are, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so. He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) may refuse to come nigh me; but certes he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) will not deny a
poor woman, who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) once, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lines of betrothal. How can she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go
without them into any honest man's house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll get them you if they are in Holland,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>said Luke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are as like to be in Rome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>replied Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us begin with Holland,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/St. Luke</b></font>)</div>observed Luke prudently.

<p/>The slave of love was furnished with money by his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) soft tyrant, and
wandered hither and thither, Coopering, and carpentering, and looking
for Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``I can't be worse if I find the vagabone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I
may be a hantle better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The months rolled on, and Sybrandt improved in spirit, but not in body;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was Margaret's pensioner for life; and a long-expected sorrow fell
upon poor Catherine, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) still more bowed down; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lost
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fine hearty bustling way, and never went about the house singing
now; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nerves were shaken, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lived in dread of some terrible
misfortune falling on Cornelis. The curse was laid on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) as well as
Sybrandt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) prayed Eli, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been a faithful partner all these
years, to take Cornelis into his (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) house again, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) live awhile at
Rotterdam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have good daughters here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but Margaret is so tender,
and thoughtful, and the little Gerard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is my joy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) grows liker his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
father every day, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) prattle cheers my heavy heart; and I do love
children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And Eli, sturdy but kindly, consented sorrowfully.

<p/>And the people of Gouda petitioned the duke for a vicar, a real vicar.
<div class="bookquote">``Ours cometh never nigh us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>said they, <div class="bookquote">``this six months past; our
children they die unchristened, and our folk unburied, except by some
chance comer.''  (<font color='red'><b>Giles/Master Giles</b></font>)</div>Giles' influence baffled this just complaint once; but a
second petition was prepared, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) gave Margaret little hope that the
present position could be maintained a single day.

<p/>So then Margaret went sorrowfully to the pretty manse to see it for the
last time, ere it should pass for ever into stranger's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would have been happy here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, and turned heart-sick
away.

<p/>On their return, Reicht Heynes proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to go and consult the
hermit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``Joan has been at you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) is the one for
hermits. I'll go, if `tis but to show thee they know no more than we
do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>And they went to the cave.

<p/>It was an excavation partly natural, partly artificial, in a bank of
rock overgrown by brambles. There was a rough stone door on hinges, and
a little window high up, and two apertures, through one of which the
people announced their gifts to the hermit, and put questions of all
sorts to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>); and when he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) chose to answer, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) voice came dissonant and
monstrous out at another small aperture.

<p/>On the face of the rock this line was cut--

<p/>Felix qui in Domino nixus ab orbe fugit.

<p/>Margaret observed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) companion that this was new since she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was here
last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht, <div class="bookquote">``like enough;''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>and looked up at it with awe. Writing
even on paper she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thought no trifle; but on rock! She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Tis
a far holier hermit than the last; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) used to come in the town now and
then, but this one ne’er shows his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face to mortal man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that is holiness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what a saint a dormouse must be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out, fie, mistress. Would ye even a beast to a man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Reicht,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``my poor father taught me overmuch, So I
will e'en sit here, and look at the manse once more. Go thou forward and
question thy solitary, and tell me whether ye get nought or nonsense
out of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), for `twill be one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>As Reicht drew near the cave a number of birds flew out of it., She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gave
a little scream, and pointed to the cave to show Margaret they had come
thence, On this Margaret felt sure there was no human being in the cave,
and gave the matter no further attention, She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fell into a deep reverie
while looking at the little manse.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was startled from it by Reicht's hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) shoulder, and a faint
voice saying, <div class="bookquote">``Let us go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You got no answer at all, Reicht,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht despondently. And they returned home.

<p/>Perhaps after all Margaret had nourished some faint secret hope in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
heart, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) reason had rejected it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) certainly went home
more dejectedly.

<p/>Just as they entered Rotterdam, Reicht said, <div class="bookquote">``Stay! Oh, Margaret, I am
ill at deceit; but `tis death to utter ill news to thee; I love thee so
dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak out, sweetheart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``I have gone through so much, I
am almost past feeling any fresh trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret, the hermit did speak to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, a hermit there? among all those birds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay; and doth not that show him (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) a holy man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I' God's name, what said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to thee, Reicht?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! Margaret, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thy story, and I prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for our Lady's
sake tell me where thy Gerard is, And I waited long for an answer, and
presently a voice came like a trumpet: `Pray for the soul of Gerard the
son of Eli!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, woe is me that I have this to tell thee, sweet Margaret! bethink
thee thou hast thy boy to live for yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me get home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret faintly.

<p/>Passing down the Brede Kirk Straet they saw Joan at the door. Reicht
said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Eh, woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been to your hermit, and heard no good
news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div>said Joan, eager for a gossip.

<p/>Margaret would not go in; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sat down disconsolate on the lowest
step but one of the little external staircase that led into Joan's
house, and let the other two gossip their fill at the top of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div>said Joan, <div class="bookquote">``what yon hermit says is sure to be sooth, He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is that
holy, I am told, that the very birds consort with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does that prove?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret deprecatingly. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen my
Gerard tame the birds in winter till they would eat from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A look of pity at this parallel passed between the other two, but they
were both too fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to say what they thought.

<p/>Joan proceeded to relate all the marvellous tales she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) had heard of this
hermit's sanctity; how he (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) never came out but at night, and prayed among
the wolves, and they never molested him (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bade the people not
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) so much food to pamper his (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) body, but to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) candles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The candles are to burn before his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saint,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered Reicht solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, lass; and to read his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) holy books wi'. A neighbour o' mine saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
hand come out, and the birds sat thereon and pecked crumbs. She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) went
for to kiss it, but the holy man whippit it away in a trice. They can't
abide a woman to touch `en, or even look at `em, saints can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What like was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, wife? Did you ask her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is my tongue for, else? Why, dear heart, all one as yourn; by the
same token a had a thumb and four fingers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look ye there now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But a deal whiter nor yourn and mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And main skinny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div>continued Joan; <div class="bookquote">``poor thing, I whiles think `tis best for

 (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/>In the midst of their gossip, Margaret, in whose ears it was all
buzzing, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) seemed lost in thought, got softly up, and crept
away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes on the ground, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brows bent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hath forgotten I am with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht Heynes ruefully.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gossip out with Joan, and then went home.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found Margaret seated cutting out a pelisse of grey cloth, and a
cape to match. Little Gerard was standing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) side, inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) left
arm, eyeing the work, and making it more difficult by wriggling about,
and fingering the arm with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) held the cloth steady, to all which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) submitted with imperturbable patience and complacency, Fancy a male
workman so entangled, impeded, worried!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ot's that, mammy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A pelisse, my pet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In the morning Reicht was sent to the hermit with the pelisse, and a
pound of thick candles.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was going out of the door Margaret said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Said you whose
son Gerard was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think, girl! How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) call him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) Gerard, son of Eli, if you had not
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div><p/>Reicht persisted she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had never mentioned him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) but as plain Gerard. But
Margaret told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) flatly she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); at which Reicht was
affronted, and went out with a little toss of the head. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
determined to question the hermit again, and did not doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would be
more liberal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) communication when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nice new pelisse and
the candles.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had not been gone long when Giles came in with ill news.

<p/>The living of Gouda would be kept vacant no longer.

<p/>Margaret was greatly distressed at this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Giles,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``ask for another month. They will give thee
another month, maybe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) returned in an hour to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) could not get a month.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have given me a week,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And what is a week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Drowning bodies catch at strawen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) reply. <div class="bookquote">``A week? a little
week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div><p/>Reicht came back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) errand out of spirits. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) oracle had declined
all further communication. So at least its obstinate silence might
fairly be interpreted.

<p/>The next day Margaret put Reicht in charge of the shop, and disappeared
all day. So the next day, and so the next. Nor would she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tell any one
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had been. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was ashamed. The fact is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) spent all
those days on one little spot of ground. When they thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dreaming,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was applying to every word that fell from Joan and Reicht the whole
powers of a far acuter mind than either of them possessed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) went to work on a scale that never occurred to either of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>)
was determined to see the hermit, and question him (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face to face, not
through a wall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) found that by making a circuit she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) could get above
the cave, and look down without being seen by the solitary. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>)
came to do it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) found an impenetrable mass of brambles. After tearing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) clothes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) hands and feet, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) was soon covered with
blood, the resolute, patient girl took out her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) scissors and steadily
snipped and cut till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made a narrow path through the enemy. But so
slow was the work that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had to leave it half done. The next day she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) scissors fresh ground, and brought a sharp knife as well, and
gently, silently, cut her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way to the roof of the cave. There she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made an
ambush of some of the cut brambles, so that the passers-by might not see
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and couched with watchful eye till the hermit should come out. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) move underneath her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never left his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cell. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began to
think it was true that he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only came out at night.

<p/>The next day she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came early and brought a jerkin she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was making for
little Gerard, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat all day, working, and watching with
dogged patience.

<p/>At four o’clock the birds began to feed; and a great many of the smaller
kinds came fluttering round the cave, and one or two went in. But most
of them, taking a preliminary seat on the bushes, suddenly discovered
Margaret, and went off with an agitated flirt of their little wings. And
although they sailed about in the air, they would not enter the cave.
Presently, to encourage them, the hermit, all unconscious of the cause
of their tremors, put out a thin white hand with a few crumbs in it,
Margaret laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) work softly, and gliding her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) body forward like a
snake, looked down at it from above; it was but a few feet from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). It
was as the woman described it, a thin, white hand.

<p/>Presently the other hand came out with a piece of bread, and the two
hands together broke it and scattered the crumbs.

<p/>But that other hand had hardly been out two seconds ere the violet eyes
that were watching above dilated; and the gentle bosom heaved, and the
whole frame quivered like a leaf in the wind.

<p/>What her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) swift eye had seen I leave the reader to guess. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suppressed
the scream that rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips, but the effort cost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear. Soon the
left hand of the hermit began to swim indistinctly before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gloating
eyes; and with a deep sigh her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head drooped, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lay like a broken
lily.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in a deep swoon, to which perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long fast to-day and the
agitation and sleeplessness of many preceding days contributed.

<p/>And there lay beauty, intelligence, and constancy, pale and silent, And
little that hermit guessed who was so near him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>). The little birds hopped
on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now, and one nearly entangled his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) little feet in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rich auburn
hair.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) troubles. The sun was set. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very cold, She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
cried a little, but I think it was partly from the remains of physical
weakness. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went home, praying God and the saints to
enlighten her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and teach her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) what to do for the best.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got home she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was pale and hysterical, and would say nothing in
answer to all their questions but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) favourite word, <div class="bookquote">``We are wading in
deep waters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The night seemed to have done wonders for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came to Catherine, who was sitting sighing by the fireside, and
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, what would you like best in the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>replied Catherine despondently, <div class="bookquote">``I know nought that would
make me smile now; I have parted from too many that were dear to me.
Gerard lost again as soon as found; Kate in heaven; and Sybrandt down
for life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor mother! Mother dear, Gouda manse is to be furnished, and cleaned,
and made ready all in a hurry, See, here be ten gold angels. Make them
go far, good mother; for I have ta’en over many already from my boy for
a set of useless loons that were aye going to find him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine and Reicht stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a moment in silence, and then out
burst a flood of questions, to none of which would she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) give a reply.
<div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have lain on my bed and thought, and thought, and
thought whiles you were all sleeping; and methinks I have got the clue
to all, I love you, dear mother; but I'll trust no woman's tongue. If I
fail this time, I'll have none to blame but Margaret Brandt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A resolute woman is a very resolute thing. And there was a deep, dogged
determination in Margaret's voice and brow that at once convinced
Catherine it would be idle to put any more questions at that time,
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and Reicht lost themselves in conjectures; and Catherine whispered
Reicht, <div class="bookquote">``Bide quiet; then `twill leak out;''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>a shrewd piece of advice,
founded on general observation.

<p/>Within an hour Catherine was on the road to Gouda in a cart, with two
stout girls to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and quite a siege artillery of mops, and pails,
and brushes, She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) came back with heightened colour, and something of the
old sparkle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eye, and kissed Margaret with a silent warmth that
spoke volumes, and at five in the morning was off again to Gouda.

<p/>That night as Reicht was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first sleep a hand gently pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shoulder, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) awoke, and was going to scream, <div class="bookquote">``Whisht,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
Margaret, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) finger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lips.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) then whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Rise softly, don thy habits, and come with me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came down, Margaret begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to loose Dragon and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
along. Now Dragon was a great mastiff, who had guarded Margaret Van Eyck
and Reicht, two lone women, for some years, and was devotedly attached
to the latter.

<p/>Margaret and Reicht went out, with Dragon walking majestically behind
them. They came back long after midnight, and retired to rest.

<p/>Catherine never knew.

<p/>Margaret read her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) friends: she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw the sturdy, faithful Frisian could
hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tongue, and Catherine could not. Yet I am not sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would
have trusted even Reicht had her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nerve equalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirit; but with
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daring and resolution, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was a tender, timid woman, a little
afraid of the dark, very afraid of being alone in it, and desperately
afraid of wolves. Now Dragon could kill a wolf in a brace of shakes; but
then Dragon would not go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), but only with Reicht; so altogether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made one confidante.

<p/>The next night they made another moonlight reconnaissance, and as I
think, with some result. For not the next night -LRB-it rained that night
and extinguished their courage-RRB-, but the next after they took with them
a companion, the last in the world Reicht Heynes would have thought of;
yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) warm approval as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was told he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was to go with
them.

<p/>Imagine how these stealthy assailants trembled and panted when the
moment of action came; imagine, if you can, the tumult in Margaret's
breast, the thrilling hopes, chasing, and chased by sickening fears;
the strange and perhaps unparalleled mixture of tender familiarity and
distant awe with which a lovely and high-spirited, but tender, adoring
woman, wife in the eye of the Law, and no wife in the eye of the
Church, trembling, blushing, paling, glowing, shivering, stole at night,
noiseless as the dew, upon the hermit of Gouda.

<p/>And the stars above seemed never so bright and calm.



<p/>CHAPTER XCII

<p/>Yes, the hermit of Gouda was the vicar of Gouda, and knew it not, so
absolute was his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) seclusion.

<p/>My reader is aware that the moment the frenzy of his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) passion passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)
was seized with remorse for having been betrayed into it. But perhaps
only those who have risen as high in religious spirit as he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) had, and
suddenly fallen, can realize the terror at himself that took possession
of him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) felt like one whom self-confidence had betrayed to the very
edge of a precipice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, good Jerome,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``how much better you knew me than I knew
myself! How bitter yet wholesome was your admonition!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Accustomed to search his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) own heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) saw at once that the true cause
of his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) fury was Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``I love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) then better than God,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)
despairingly; <div class="bookquote">``better than the Church, From such a love what can spring
to me, or to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) shuddered at the thought. <div class="bookquote">``Let the strong battle
temptation; `tis for the weak to flee. And who is weaker than I have
shown myself? What is my penitence, my religion? A pack of cards built
by degrees into a fair-seeming structure; and lo! one breath of earthly
love, and it lies in the dust, I must begin again, and on a surer
foundation.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) resolved to leave Holland at once, and spend years of
his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) life in some distant convent before returning to it. By that time
the temptations of earthly passion would be doubly baffled; and older
and a better monk, he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) should be more master of his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) earthly affections,
and Margaret, seeing herself abandoned, would marry, and love another,
The very anguish this last thought cost him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) showed the self-searcher and
self-denier that he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) was on the path of religious duty.

<p/>But in leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) immortal good and hers, he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) was not to
neglect her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) temporal weal. Indeed, the sweet thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) could make her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
comfortable for life, and rich in this world's goods, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was not
bound to despise, sustained him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) in the bitter struggle it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) to
turn his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) without one kind word or look, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, what will she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
think of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) groaned. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I not seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of all creatures the
most heartless, inhuman? but so best; ay, better she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should hate me,
miserable that I am, Heaven is merciful, and giveth my broken heart this
comfort; I can make that villain restore her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shall never
lose another true lover by poverty. Another? Ah me! ah me! God and the
saints to mine aid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) fared on this errand has been related. But first, as you may
perhaps remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) went at night to shrive the hermit of Gouda. He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>)
found him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) dying, and never left him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) had closed his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) eyes and
buried him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) beneath the floor of the little oratory attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) cell.
It was the peaceful end of a stormy life. The hermit had been a soldier,
and even now carried a steel corselet next his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) skin, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was now
Christ's soldier as he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had been Satan's. When Clement had shriven him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
and prayed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) turn, sought counsel of one who was dying
in so pious a frame, The hermit advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) successor in this
peaceful retreat. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been a hard fight against the world, the
flesh, and the devil, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had never thoroughly baffled them till he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
retired into the citadel of Solitude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>These words and the hermit's pious and peaceful death, which speedily
followed, and set as it were the seal of immortal truth on them, made a
deep impression upon Clement. Nor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) case had they any prejudice to
combat; the solitary recluse was still profoundly revered in the Church,
whether immured as an anchorite or anchoress in some cave or cell
belonging to a monastery, or hidden in the more savage but laxer
seclusion of the independent hermitage. And Clement knew more about the
hermits of the Church than most divines at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) time of life; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had read
much thereon at the monastery near Tergou, had devoured their lives
with wonder and delight in the manuscripts of the Vatican, and conversed
earnestly about them with the mendicant friars of several nations.
Before Printing these friars were the great circulators of those local
annals and biographies which accumulated in the convents of every land.
Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) teacher, Jerome, had been three years an anchorite on the
heights of Camaldoli, where for more than four centuries the Thebaid had
been revived; and Jerome, cold and curt on most religious themes, was
warm with enthusiasm on this one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) had pored over the annals of
St. John Baptist's abbey, round about which the hermit's caves were
scattered, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) the names of many a noble, and many a famous
warrior who had ended his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) days there a hermit, and of many a bishop and
archbishop who had passed from the see to the hermitage, or from the
hermitage to the see. Among the former the Archbishop of Ravenna; among
the latter Pope Victor the Ninth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) too, with grim delight, of
their multifarious austerities, and how each hermit set himself to find
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) was weakest, and attacked himself without mercy or remission
till there, even there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) was strongest. And how seven times in the
twenty-four hours, in thunder, rain, or snow, by daylight, twilight,
moonlight, or torchlight, the solitaries flocked from distant points,
over rugged precipitous ways, to worship in the convent church; at
matins, at prime, tierce, sexte, nones, vespers, and compline. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>)
even, under eager questioning, described to him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) the persons of famous
anchorites he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had sung the Psalter and prayed with there; the only
intercourse their vows allowed, except with special permission. Moncata,
Duke of Moncata and Cardova, and Hidalgo of Spain, who in the flower of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hidalgo</b></font>) youth had retired thither from the pomps, vanities, and pleasures of
the world; Father John Baptist of Novara, who had led armies to
battle, but was now a private soldier of Christ; Cornelius, Samuel,
and Sylvanus. This last, when the great Duchess de' Medici obtained the
Pope's leave, hitherto refused, to visit Camaldoli, went down and met
her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) at the first wooden cross, and there, surrounded as she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was with
courtiers and flatterers, remonstrated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>), and persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>), and
warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>), not to profane that holy mountain, where no woman for so
many centuries had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) foot; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), awed by the place and the
man, retreated with all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) captains, soldiers, courtiers, and pages
from that one hoary hermit. At Basle Clement found fresh materials,
especially with respect to German and English anchorites; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had
even prepared a <div class="bookquote">``Catena Eremitarum''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from the year of our Lord 250, when
Paul of Thebes commenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ninety years of solitude, down to the year
1470. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) called them Angelorum amici et animalium, i.e.

<p/>FRIENDS OF ANGELS AND ANIMALS.

<p/>Thus, though in those days he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) never thought to be a recluse, the road
was paved, so to speak; and when the dying hermit of Gouda blessed the
citadel of Solitude, where he (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) had fought the good fight and won it, and
invited him (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) to take up the breast-plate of faith that now fell off his (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>)
own shrunken body, Clement said within himself: <div class="bookquote">``Heaven itself led my
foot hither to this end.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), too, as no small coincidence
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) patron, St. Bavon, was a hermit, and an austere one, a
cuirassier of the solitary cell.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was reconciled to Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) went eagerly
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) abode, praying Heaven it might not have been already occupied in
these three days. The fear was not vain; these famous dens never wanted
a human tenant long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) found the rude stone door ajar; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) made
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was too late; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) opened the door and went softly in. No; the
cell was vacant, and there were the hermit's great ivory crucifix, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
pens, ink, seeds, and, memento mori, a skull; his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cilice of hair, and
another of bristles; his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) well-worn sheepskin pelisse and hood; his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
hammer, chisel, and psaltery, etc.. Men and women had passed that
way, but none had ventured to intrude, far less to steal. Faith and
simplicity had guarded that keyless door more securely than the houses
of the laity were defended by their gates like a modern gaol, and think
iron bars at every window, and the gentry by moat, bastion, chevaux de
frise, and portcullis.

<p/>As soon as Clement was fairly in the cell there was a loud flap, and a
flutter, and down came a great brown owl from a corner, and whirled out
of the window, driving the air cold on Clement's face, He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) started and
shuddered.

<p/>Was this seeming owl something diabolical? trying to deter him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
soul's good? On second thoughts, might it not be some good spirit
the hermit had employed to keep the cell for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), perhaps the hermit
himself? Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) concluded that it was just an owl, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) would
try and make friends with it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) kneeled down and inaugurated his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) new life with prayer.

<p/>Clement had not only an earthly passion to quell, the power of which
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) tremble for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eternal weal, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had a penance to do for
having given way to ire, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) besetting sin, and cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) own brothers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) looked round this roomy cell furnished with so many comforts, and
compared it with the pictures in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) mind of the hideous place, eremus
in eremo, a desert in a desert, where holy Jerome, hermit, and the
Plutarch of hermits, had wrestled with sickness, temptation, and despair
four mortal years; and with the inaccessible and thorny niche, a hole
in a precipice, where the boy hermit Benedict buried himself, and lived
three years on the pittance the good monk Romanus could spare him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) from
his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) scanty commons, and subdivided that mouthful with his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) friend, a
raven; and the hollow tree of his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) patron St. Bavon; and the earthly
purgatory at Fribourg, where lived a nameless saint in a horrid cavern,
his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) eyes chilled with perpetual gloom, and his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) ears stunned with an
eternal waterfall; and the pillar on which St. Simeon Stylita existed
forty-five years; and the destina, or stone box, of St. Dunstan, where,
like Hilarion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) bulrush hive, sepulchro potius quam domu, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) could
scarce sit, stand, or lie; and the living tombs, sealed with lead, of
Thais, and Christina, and other recluses; and the damp dungeon of St.
Alred. These and scores more of the dismal dens in which true hermits
had worn out their wasted bodies on the rock, and the rock under their
sleeping bodies, and their praying knees, all came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>)
said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``This sweet retreat is for safety of the soul; but what
for penance Jesu aid me against faults to come; and for the fault I rue,
face of man I will not see for a twelvemonth and a day.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) had famous
precedents in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) eye even for this last and unusual severity. In fact
the original hermit of this very cell was clearly under the same vow.
Hence the two apertures, through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) was spoken to, and replied.

<p/>Adopting, in other respects, the uniform rule of hermits and anchorites,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) divided his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) day into the seven offices, ignoring the petty
accidents of light and dark, creations both of Him (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) prayed so
unceasingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) learned the psalter by heart, and in all the intervals
of devotion, not occupied by broken slumbers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) worked hard with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>)
hands. No article of the hermit's rule was more strict or more ancient
than this. And here his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) self-imposed penance embarrassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>), for
what work could he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) do, without being seen, that should benefit his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>)
neighbours? for the hermit was to labour for himself in those cases only
where his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) subsistence depended on it. Now Clement's modest needs were
amply supplied by the villagers.

<p/>On moonlight nights he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) would steal out like a thief, and dig some
poor man's garden on the outskirts of the village. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) made baskets and
dropped them slily at humble doors.

<p/>And since he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) could do nothing for the bodies of those who passed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>)
cell in daytime, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) went out in the dead of the night with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) hammer
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) chisel, and carved moral and religious sentences all down the
road upon the sandstone rocks. <div class="bookquote">``Who knows?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``often a chance
shaft strikes home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, sore heart, comfort thou the poor and bereaved with holy words of
solace in their native tongue; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) said ``well, `tis `clavis ad corda
plebis.''' Also he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered the learned Colonna had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) of
the written mountains in the east, where kings had inscribed their
victories, ``What,'' said Clement, <div class="bookquote">``are they so wise, those Eastern
monarchs, to engrave their war-like glory upon the rock, making a blood
bubble endure so long as earth; and shall I leave the rocks about me
silent on the King of Glory, at whose word they were, and at whose
breath they shall be dust? Nay, but these stones shall speak to weary
wayfarers of eternal peace, and of the Lamb, whose frail and afflicted
yet happy servant worketh them among.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ages</b></font>)</div><p/>Now at this time the inspired words that have consoled the poor and the
afflicted for so many ages were not yet printed in Dutch, so that these
sentences of gold from the holy evangelists came like fresh oracles
from heaven, or like the dew on parched flowers; and the poor hermit's
written rocks softened a heart Or two, and sent the heavy laden singing
on their way-LRB-1-RRB-.

<p/>These holy oracles that seemed to spring up around him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) like magic; his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
prudent answers through his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) window to such as sought ghostly counsel;
and above all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) invisibility, soon gained him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) a prodigious
reputation, This was not diminished by the medical advice they now and
then extorted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) sore against his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) will, by tears and entreaties;
for if the patients got well they gave the holy hermit the credit, and
if not they laid all the blame on the devil. <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) killed nobody,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) remedies were womanish and weak.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sage wormwood sion hyssop borage spikenard dog tongue mantle feverfew Faith all</b></font>)</div>Sage and wormwood, sion,
hyssop, borage, spikenard, dog's-tongue, our Lady's mantle, feverfew,
and Faith, and all in small quantities except the last.

<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) abstinence, sure sign of a saint. The eggs and milk they
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) at first he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) refused with horror. Know ye not the hermit's
rule is bread, or herbs, and water? Eggs, they are birds in disguise;
for when the bird dieth, then the egg rotteth. As for milk, it is little
better than white blood. And when they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) too much bread he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
refused it. Then they used to press it on him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Nay, holy father; give
the overplus to the poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You who go among the poor can do that better. Is bread a thing to fling
haphazard from an hermit's window?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And to those who persisted after
this: <div class="bookquote">``To live on charity, yet play Sir Bountiful, is to lie with the
right hand. Giving another's to the poor, I should beguile them of their
thanks, and cheat thee the true giver. Thus do thieves, whose boast it
is they bleed the rich into the lap of the poor. Occasio avaritiae nomen
pauperum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the souls</b></font>)</div><p/>When nothing else would convince the good souls, this piece of Latin
always brought them round. So would a line of Virgil's Aeneid.

<p/>This great reputation of sanctity was all external. Inside the cell was
a man who held the hermit of Gouda as cheap as dirt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I cannot deceive myself; I cannot deceive God's animals.
See the little birds, how coy they be; I feed and feed them, and long
for their friendship, yet will they never come within, nor take my hand,
by lighting on't. For why? No Paul, no Benedict, no Hugh of Lincoln, no
Columba, no Guthlac bides in this cell. Hunted doe flieth not hither,
for here is no Fructuosus, nor Aventine, nor Albert of Suabia; nor e'en
a pretty squirrel cometh from the wood hard by for the acorns I have
hoarded; for here abideth no Columban. The very owl that was here hath
fled. They are not to be deceived; I have a Pope's word for that; Heaven
rest his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement had one advantage over her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) whose image in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was bent
on destroying.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had suffered and survived the pang of bereavement, and the mind
cannot quite repeat such anguish. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had built up a habit of
looking on her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) as dead. After that strange scene in the church and
churchyard of St. Laurens, that habit might be compared to a structure
riven by a thunderbolt. It was shattered, but stones enough stood to
found a similar habit on; to look on her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) as dead to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>).

<p/>And by severe subdivision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) time and thoughts, by unceasing prayers
and manual labour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) did in about three months succeed in benumbing the
earthly half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) heart.

<p/>But lo! within a day or two of this first symptom of mental peace
returning slowly, there descended upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) mind a horrible despondency.

<p/>Words cannot utter it, for words never yet painted a likeness of
despair. Voices seemed to whisper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) ear, <div class="bookquote">``Kill thyself! kill! kill!
kill!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) longed to obey the voices, for life was intolerable.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) wrestled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) dark enemy with prayers and tears; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) prayed God
but to vary his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) temptation. <div class="bookquote">``Oh let mine enemy have power to scourge me
with red-hot whips, to tear me leagues and leagues over rugged places
by the hair of my head, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) has served many a holy hermit, that yet
baffled him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) at last; to fly on me like a raging lion; to gnaw me with
a serpent's fangs; any pain, any terror, but this horrible gloom of the
soul that shuts me from all light of Thee and of the saints.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And now a freezing thought crossed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>). What if the triumphs of the
powers of darkness over Christian souls in desert places had been
suppressed, and only their defeats recorded, or at least in full; for
dark hints were scattered about antiquity that now first began to grin
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) with terrible meaning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THEY WANDERED IN THE DESERT AND PERISHED BY SERPENTS,''  (<font color='red'><b>an father</b></font>)</div>said an ancient
father of hermits that went into solitude, <div class="bookquote">``and were seen no more.''  (<font color='red'><b>hermits</b></font>)</div>And
another at a more recent epoch wrote: Vertuntur ad melancholiam: <div class="bookquote">``they
turn to gloomy madness.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>These two statements, were they not one? for
the ancient fathers never spoke with regret of the death of the body.
No, the hermits so lost were perished souls, and the serpents were
diabolical -LRB-2-RRB- thoughts, the natural brood of solitude.

<p/>St. Jerome went into the desert with three companions; one fled in the
first year, two died; how? The single one that lasted was a gigantic
soul with an iron body.

<p/>The cotemporary who related this made no comment, expressed no wonder,
What, then, if here was a glimpse of the true proportion in every age,
and many souls had always been lost in solitude for one gigantic mind
and iron body that survived this terrible ordeal.

<p/>The darkened recluse now cast his (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) despairing eyes over antiquity to see
what weapons the Christian arsenal contained that might befriend him (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>).
The greatest of all was prayer. Alas! it was a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) malady to
be unable to pray with true fervour. The very system of mechanical
supplication he (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) had for months carried out so severely by rule had
rather checked than fostered his (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) power of originating true prayer.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) prayed louder than ever, but the heart hung back cold and gloomy, and
let the words go up alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor wingless prayers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``you will not get half-way to
heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A fiend of this complexion had been driven out of King Saul by music.

<p/>Clement took up the hermit's psaltery, and with much trouble mended the
strings and tuned it.

<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) could not play it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) soul was so out of tune. The sounds jarred
on it, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) almost mad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, wretched me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``Saul had a saint to play to him (<font color='blue'><b>Saul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Saul</b></font>) was
not alone with the spirits of darkness; but here is no sweet bard of
Israel to play to me; I, lonely, with crushed heart, on which a black
fiend sitteth mountain high, must make the music to uplift that heart
to heaven; it may not be.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) grovelled on the earth weeping and
tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) hair.

<p/>VERTEBATUR AD MELANCHOLIAM.

<p/>-LRB-1-RRB- It requires nowadays a strong effort of the imagination
to realize the effect on poor people who had never seen them
before of such sentences as this

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blessed are the poor''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>etc..

<p/>-LRB-2-RRB- The primitive writer was so interpreted by others
besides Clement; and in particular by Peter of Blois, a
divine of the twelfth century, whose comment is noteworthy,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) himself was a forty-year hermit.



<p/>CHAPTER XCIII

<p/>One day as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) lay there sighing and groaning, prayerless, tuneless,
hopeless, a thought flashed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mind. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had done for the
poor and the wayfarer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would do for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) den of
despair with the name of God and the magic words of holy writ, and the
pious, prayerful consolations of the Church.

<p/>Then, like Christian at Apollyon's feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) hand suddenly
out and caught, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) sword, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had none, but peaceful labour's
humbler weapon, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) chisel, and worked with it as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) soul depended
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) arm.

<p/>They say that Michael Angelo in the next generation used to carve
statues, not like our timid sculptors, by modelling the work in clay,
and then setting a mechanic to chisel it, but would seize the block,
conceive the image, and at once, with mallet and steel, make the marble
chips fly like mad about him (<font color='blue'><b>mechanic</b></font>), and the mass sprout into form. Even so
Clement drew no lines to guide his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) memory for the
gracious words, and then dashed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) work and eagerly graved them in
the soft stone, between working and fighting.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) begged his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) visitors for candle ends, and rancid oil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything is good enough for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if `twill but burn.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So at
night the cave glowed afar off like a blacksmith's forge, through the
window and the gaping chinks of the rude stone door, and the rustics
beholding crossed themselves and suspected deviltries, and within the
holy talismans, one after another, came upon the walls, and the sparks
and the chips flew day and night, night and day, as the soldier of
Solitude and of the Church plied, with sighs and groans, his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) bloodless
weapon, between working and fighting.

<p/>Kyrie Eleison.

<p/>Christe Eleison.

<p/>And underneath the great crucifix, which was fastened to the wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancte</b></font>)
graved this from Augustine:

<p/>O anima Christiana, respice vulnera patientis, sanguinem morientis,
pretium redemptionis. Haec quanta sint cogitate, et in statera mentis
vestrae appendite, ut totus vobis figatur in corde, qui pro vobis totus
fixus est in cruce. Nam si passio Christi ad memoriam revocetur, nihil
est tam durum quod non aequo animo toleretur.

<p/>Which may be thus rendered: O Christian soul, look on the wounds of
the suffering One, the blood of the dying One, the price paid for our
redemption! These things, oh, think how great they be, and weigh them in
the balance of thy mind: that He (<font color='blue'><b>Christi</b></font>) may be wholly nailed to thy heart,
who for thee was all nailed unto the cross. For do but call to mind the
sufferings of Christ, and there is nought on earth too hard to endure
with composure.

<p/>Soothed a little, a very little, by the sweet and pious words he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was
raising all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), and weighed down with watching and working night
and day, Clement one morning sank prostrate with fatigue, and a deep
sleep overpowered him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) for many hours. Awaking quietly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) heard a little
cheep; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes, and lo! upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) breviary, which was on a low
stool near his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) feet, ruffling all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) feathers with a single pull, and
smoothing them as suddenly, and cocking his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) bill this way and that with
a vast display of cunning purely imaginary, perched a robin redbreast.

<p/>Clement held his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) breath.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) half closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes lest they should frighten the airy guest.

<p/>Down came robin on the floor.

<p/>When there he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) went through his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) pantomime of astuteness; and then,
pim, pim, pim, with three stiff little hops, like a ball of worsted on
vertical wires, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was on the hermit's bare foot. On this eminence he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
swelled and contracted again, with ebb and flow of feathers; but Clement
lost this, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) quite closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes and scarce drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) breath in
fear of frightening and losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) visitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was content to feel the
minute claw on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) foot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) could but just feel it, and that by help of
knowing it was there.

<p/>Presently a little flirt with two little wings, and the feathered
busybody was on the breviary again.

<p/>Then Clement determined to try and feed this pretty little fidget
without frightening it away. But it was very difficult.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had a piece of bread within reach, but how get at it? I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was
five minutes creeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) hand up to that bread, and when there he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) must
not move his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) arm.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) slily got a crumb between a finger and thumb and shot it as boys do
marbles, keeping the hand quite still.

<p/>Cockrobin saw it fall near him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), and did sagacity, but moved not.

<p/>When another followed, and then another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) popped down and caught up
one of the crumbs, but not quite understanding this mystery fled with
it, for more security, to an eminence; to wit, the hermit's knee.

<p/>And so the game proceeded till a much larger fragment than usual rolled
along.

<p/>Here was a prize. Cockrobin pounced on it, bore it aloft, and fled so
swiftly into the world with it, the cave resounded with the buffeted
air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, bless thee, sweet bird,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sighed the stricken solitary; <div class="bookquote">``thy wings
are music, and thou a feathered ray camedst to light my darkened soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And from that to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) orisons, and then to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) tools with a little bit of
courage, and this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) day's work:

<p/>Veni, Creator Spiritus,
Mentes tuorem visita,
Imple superna gratia
Quae tu creasti pectora

<p/>Accende lumen sensibus,
Mentes tuorum visita,
Infirma nostri corporis,
Virtute firmans perpeti.

<p/>And so the days rolled on; and the weather got colder, and Clement's
heart got warmer, and despondency was rolling away; and by-and-by,
somehow or another, it was gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had outlived it.

<p/>It had come like a cloud, and it went like one.

<p/>And presently all was reversed; his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cell seemed illuminated with joy.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) work pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) prayers were full of unction; his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) psalms of
praise. Hosts of little birds followed their crimson leader, and flying
from snow, and a parish full of Cains, made friends one after another
with Abel; fast friends. And one keen frosty night as he (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) sang the
praises of God to his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) tuneful psaltery, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) hollow cave rang forth
the holy psalmody upon the night, as if that cave itself was Tubal's
surrounding shell, or David's harp, he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) heard a clear whine, not
unmelodious; it became louder and less in tune. He (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) peeped through
the chinks of his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) rude door, and there sat a great red wolf moaning
melodiously with his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) nose high in the air.

<p/>Clement was rejoiced. <div class="bookquote">``My sins are going,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``and the creatures
of God are owning me, one after another.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And in a burst of enthusiasm
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) struck up the laud:

<p/>``Praise Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) all ye creatures of His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) sang the wolf bayed at intervals.

<p/>But above all he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) seemed now to be drawing nearer to that celestial
intercourse which was the sign and the bliss of the true hermit; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
had dreams about the saints and angels, so vivid, they were more like
visions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) saw bright figures clad in woven snow. They bent on him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes
lovelier than those of the antelope's he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had seen at Rome, and fanned
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) with broad wings hued like the rainbow, and their gentle voices bade
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) speed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) course.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had not long enjoyed this felicity when his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) dreams began to take
another and a strange complexion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) wandered with Fra Colonna over the
relics of antique nations, and the friar was lame and had a staff,
and this staff he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) waved over the mighty ruins, and were they Egyptian,
Greek, or Roman, straightway the temples and palaces, whose wrecks they
were, rose again like an exhalation, and were thronged with the famous
dead. Songsters that might have eclipsed both Apollo and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) rival
poured forth their lays; women, god-like in form, and draped like
Minerva, swam round the marble courts in voluptuous but easy and
graceful dances. Here sculptors carved away amidst admiring pupils, and
forms of supernatural beauty grew out of Parian marble in a quarter of
an hour; and grave philosophers conversed on high and subtle matters,
with youth listening reverently; it was a long time ago. And still
beneath all this wonderful panorama a sort of suspicion or expectation
lurked in the dreamer's mind. <div class="bookquote">``This is a prologue, a flourish, there is
something behind; something that means me no good, something mysterious,
awful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div><p/>And one night that the wizard Colonna had transcended himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>)
pointed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) stick, and there was a swallowing up of many great
ancient cities, and the pair stood on a vast sandy plain with a huge
crimson sun sinking to rest, There were great palm-trees; and there
were bulrush hives, scarce a man's height, dotted all about to the sandy
horizon, and the crimson sun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are the anchorites of the Theban desert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div>said Colonna calmly;
<div class="bookquote">``followers not of Christ and His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) apostles, and the great fathers, but
of the Greek pupils of the Egyptian pupils of the Brachmans and
Gymnosophists.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div><p/>And Clement thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) burned to go and embrace the holy men and
tell them his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) troubles, and seek their advice. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was tied by the
feet somehow, and could not move, and the crimson sun sank, and it got
dusk, and the hives scarce visible, And Colonna's figure became shadowy
and shapeless, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonna</b></font>) eyes glowed ten times brighter; and this thing
all eyes spoke and said: <div class="bookquote">``Nay, let them be, a pack of fools I see how
dismal it all is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fra Colonna/Colonna/COLONNA</b></font>)</div>Then with a sudden sprightliness, <div class="bookquote">``But I hear one of
them has a manuscript of Petronius, on papyrus; I go to buy it; farewell
for ever, for ever, for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>And it was pitch dark, and a light came at Clement's back like a gentle
stroke, a glorious roseate light. It warmed as well as brightened. It
loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) feet from the ground; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) turned round, and there, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) face
irradiated with sunshine, and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hair glittering like the gloriola of a
saint, was Margaret Brandt.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) blushed and smiled and cast a look of ineffable tenderness on him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``be whose thou wilt by day, but at night be
mine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Even as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) spoke, the agitation of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) so suddenly awakened him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) found himself lying trembling from head to foot.

<p/>That radiant figure and mellow voice seemed to have struck his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) nightly
keynote.

<p/>Awake he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) could pray, and praise, and worship God; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was master of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
thoughts. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes in sleep, Margaret, or Satan in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
shape, beset him (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>), a seeming angel of light. He (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) might dream of a thousand
different things, wide as the poles asunder, ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) woke the imperial
figure was sure to come and extinguish all the rest in a moment, stellas
exortus uti aetherius sol; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came glowing with two beauties never
before united, an angel's radiance and a woman's blushes.

<p/>Angels cannot blush. So he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) knew it was a fiend.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) was alarmed, but not so much surprised as at the demon's last
artifice. From Anthony to Nicholas of the Rock scarce hermit that had
not been thus beset; sometimes with gay voluptuous visions, sometimes
with lovely phantoms, warm, tangible, and womanly without, demons
within, nor always baffled even by the saints. Witness that <div class="bookquote">``angel form
with a devil's heart''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that came hanging its lovely head, like a bruised
flower, to St. Macarius, with a feigned tale, and wept, and wept, and
wept, and beguiled him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) first of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) tears and then of half his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) virtue.

<p/>But with the examples of Satanic power and craft had come down copious
records of the hermits' triumphs and the weapons by which they had
conquered.

<p/>Domandum est Corpus; the body must be tamed; this had been their
watchword for twelve hundred years. It was a tremendous war-cry; for
they called the earthly affections, as well as appetites, body, and
crushed the whole heart through the suffering and mortified flesh.

<p/>Clement then said to himself that the great enemy of man had retired
but to spring with more effect, and had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) a few days of
true purity and joy only to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) guard against the soft
blandishments he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was pouring over the soul that had survived the
buffeting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) black wings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) applied himself to tame the body, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
shortened his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) sleep, lengthened his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) prayers, and increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) severe
temperance to abstinence. Hitherto, following the ordinary rule, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had
eaten only at sunset. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) ate but once in forty-eight hours, drinking
a little water every day.

<p/>On this the visions became more distinct.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) flew to a famous antidote, to <div class="bookquote">``the grand febrifuge''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of
anchorites--cold water.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) found the deepest part of the stream that ran by his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cell; it rose
not far off at a holy well; and clearing the bottom of the large stones,
made a hole where he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) could stand in water to the chin, and fortified by
so many examples, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) sprang from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) rude bed upon the next diabolical
assault, and entered the icy water.

<p/>It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) gasp and almost shriek with the cold. It froze his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) marrow.
<div class="bookquote">``I shall die,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I shall die; but better this than fire
eternal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was so stiff in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) joints he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) could not move,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) seemed one great ache. And even in sleep he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) very
bones were like so many raging teeth, till the phantom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) dreaded came
and gave one pitying smile, and all the pain was gone.

<p/>Then, feeling that to go into the icy water again, enfeebled by fasts
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was, might perhaps carry the guilt of suicide, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) scourged himself
till the blood ran, and so lay down smarting. And when exhaustion began
to blunt the smart down to a throb, that moment the present was away,
and the past came smiling back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) sat with Margaret at the duke's
feast, the minstrels played divinely, and the purple fountains gushed.
Youth and love reigned in each heart, and perfumed the very air.

<p/>Then the scene shifted, and they stood at the altar together man and
wife. And no interruption this time, and they wandered hand in hand, and
told each other their horrible dreams. As for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had dreamed she (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
was dead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was a monk; and really the dream had been so vivid and
so full of particulars that only his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) eyesight could even now convince
him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) it was only a dream, and they were really one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And this new keynote once struck, every tune ran upon it. Awake he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was Clement the hermit, risen from unearthly visions of the night, as
dangerous as they were sweet; asleep he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Gerard Eliassoen, the happy
husband of the loveliest and best, and truest girl in Holland: all the
happier that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been for some time the sport of hideous dreams, in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) constant fasts, coupled with other austerities, and the deep mental
anxiety of a man fighting with a supernatural foe, had now reduced
him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) nearly to a skeleton; but still on those aching bones hung flesh
unsubdued, and quivering with an earthly passion; so, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>)
thought; <div class="bookquote">``or why had ill spirits such power over him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) opinion was
confirmed, when one day he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) detected himself sinking to sleep actually
with a feeling of complacency, because now Margaret would come and he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>)
should feel no more pain, and the unreal would be real, and the real
unreal, for an hour.

<p/>On this he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) rose hastily with a cry of dismay, and stripping to the skin
climbed up to the brambles above his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) cave, and flung himself on them,
and rolled on them writhing with the pain: then he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) came into his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) den a
mass of gore, and lay moaning for hours; till, out of sheer exhaustion,
he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) fell into a deep and dreamless sleep.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) awoke to bodily pain, and mental exultation; he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) had broken the fatal
spell. Yes, it was broken; another and another day passed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) image
molested him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) no more. But he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) caught himself sighing at his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) victory.

<p/>The birds got tamer and tamer, they perched upon his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) hand. Two of them
let him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) gild their little claws. Eating but once in two days he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) had more
to give them.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) tranquility was not to last long.

<p/>A woman's voice came in from the outside, told him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) own story in a
very few words, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) where Gerard was to be found.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was so astounded he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could only say, with an instinct of self-defence,
<div class="bookquote">``Pray for the soul of Gerard the son of Eli!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>meaning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was dead
to the world. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat wondering.

<p/>When the woman was gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) determined, after an inward battle, to risk
being seen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) peeped after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to see who it could be; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) took
so many precautions, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran so quickly back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friend, that the
road was clear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Satan!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) directly.

<p/>And that night back came his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) visions of earthly love and happiness so
vividly, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could count every auburn hair in Margaret's head, and see
the pupils of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) began to despair, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I must leave this country; here I
am bound fast in memory's chain;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and began to dread his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) cell. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``A breath from hell hath infected it, and robbed even these holy words
of their virtue.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And unconsciously imitating St. Jerome, a victim
of earthly hallucinations, as overpowering, and coarser, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
warmest covering out into the wood hard by, and there flung down under
a tree that torn and wrinkled leather bag of bones, which a little ago
might have served a sculptor for Apollo.

<p/>Whether the fever of his (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) imagination intermitted, as a master mind of
our day has shown that all things intermit-LRB-9-RRB- or that this really broke
some subtle link, I know not, but his (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) sleep was dreamless.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) awoke nearly frozen, but warm with joy within.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall yet be a true hermit, Dei gratia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>).

<p/>The next day some good soul left on his (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) little platform a new lambs-wool
pelisse and cape, warm, soft, and ample.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) had a moment's misgiving on account of its delicious softness and
warmth; but that passed. It was the right skin-LRB-10-RRB-, and a mark that
Heaven approved his (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) present course.

<p/>It restored warmth to his (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) bones after he (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) came in from his (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) short rest.

<p/>And now, at one moment he (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) saw victory before him (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) could but live
to it; at another, he (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) said to himself, ```Tis but another lull; be on thy
guard, Clement.''

<p/>And this thought agitated his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) nerves and kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) in continual awe.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was like a soldier within the enemy's lines.

<p/>One night, a beautiful clear frosty night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cell,
after a short rest. The stars were wonderful. Heaven seemed a thousand
times larger as well as brighter than earth, and to look with a thousand
eyes instead of one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, wonderful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``that there should be men who do crimes by
night; and others scarce less mad, who live for this little world, and
not for that great and glorious one, which nightly, to all eyes not
blinded by custom, reveals its glowing glories. Thank God I am a
hermit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And in this mood he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cell door.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) paused at it; it was closed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, methought I left it open,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``The wind. There is not a
breath of wind. What means this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) hand upon the rugged door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) looked through one of
the great chinks, for it was much smaller in places than the aperture
it pretended to close, and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) little oil wick burning just where he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
had left it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) sighed, <div class="bookquote">``when I start and tremble at nothing?
Either I did shut it, or the fiend hath shut it after me to disturb my
happy soul. Retro Sathanas!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cave rapidly, and began with somewhat nervous
expedition to light one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) largest tapers. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was lighting it,
there was a soft sigh in the cave.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) started and dropped the candle just as it was lighting, and it went
out.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) stooped for it hurriedly and lighted it, listening intently.

<p/>When it was lighted he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) shaded it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) hand from behind, and threw
the faint light all round the cell.

<p/>In the farthest corner the outline of the wall seemed broken.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) took a step towards the place with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) heart beating.

<p/>The candle at the same time getting brighter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) saw it was the figure
of a woman.

<p/>Another step with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) knees knocking together.

<p/>IT WAS MARGARET BRANDT.

<p/>-LRB-1-RRB- Beat down Satan under our feet.

<p/>-LRB-2-RRB- Up, hearts!

<p/>-LRB-3-RRB- O God our refuge and strength.

<p/>-LRB-4-RRB- O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,
have mercy upon me!

<p/>-LRB-5-RRB- O Holy Trinity, one God, have mercy upon us.

<p/>-LRB-6-RRB- From the assaults of demons--from the wrath to come--
from everlasting damnation, deliver us, O Lord!

<p/>-LRB-7-RRB- See the English collect, St., Michael and all Angels.

<p/>-LRB-8-RRB- Of whom may we seek succour but of Thee, O Lord, who for
our sins art justly displeased -LRB-and that torrent of prayer,
the following verse-RRB-.

<p/>-LRB-9-RRB- Dr. Dickson, author of Fallacies of the Faculty, etc..

<p/>-LRB-10-RRB- It is related of a mediaeval hermit, that being offered
a garment made of cats' skins, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickson</b></font>) rejected it, saying, <div class="bookquote">``I
have heard of a lamb of God but I never heard of a cat of
God.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XCIV

<p/>HER attitude was one to excite pity rather than terror, in eyes not
blinded by a preconceived notion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>) bosom was fluttering like a bird,
and the red and white coming and going in her (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>) cheeks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>)
hand against the wall by the instinct of timid things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>) trembled
so; and the marvellous mixed gaze of love, and pious awe, and pity, and
tender memories, those purple eyes cast on the emaciated and glaring
hermit, was an event in nature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Thou art come at last in flesh and blood; come to me
as thou camest to holy Anthony. But I am ware of thee. I thought thy
wiles were not exhausted. I am armed.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With this he (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>) snatched up his (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>)
small crucifix and held it out at her (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>), astonished, and the candle in the
other hand, both crucifix and candle shaking violently. <div class="bookquote">``Exorcizo te.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>) piteously; and put out two pretty deprecating palms.
<div class="bookquote">``Alas! work me no ill! It is Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Liar!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted the hermit. <div class="bookquote">``Margaret was fair, but not so supernatural
fair as thou. Thou didst shrink at that sacred name, thou subtle
hypocrite. In Nomine Dei exorcizo vos.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Jesu!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>gasped Margaret, in extremity of terror, <div class="bookquote">``curse me not! I
will go home. I thought I might come. For very manhood be-Latin me not!
Oh, Gerard, is it thus you and I meet after all, after all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cowered almost to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knees and sobbed with superstitious fear
and wounded affection.

<p/>Impregnated as he (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>) was with Satanophobia he (<font color='blue'><b>Faculty</b></font>) might perhaps have doubted
still whether this distressed creature, all woman and nature, was
not all art and fiend. But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spontaneous appeal to that sacred name
dissolved his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) chimera; and let him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) see with his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) eyes, and hear with his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>)
ears.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) uttered a cry of self-reproach, and tried to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) but what with
fasts, what with the overpowering emotion of a long solitude so broken,
he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) could not. <div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) gasped, shaking over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and is it thou? And
have I met thee with hard words? Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And they were both choked with
emotion and could not speak for a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heed it not much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret bravely, struggling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tears;
<div class="bookquote">``you took me for another: for a devil; oh! oh! oh! oh! oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, sweet soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) could speak more than a word
at a time, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have been much beset by the evil one since I came
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret looked round with a shudder. <div class="bookquote">``Like enow. Then oh take my hand,
and let me lead thee from this foul place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, desert my cell; and go into the world again? Is it for that thou
hast come to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) sadly and reproachfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, Gerard, I am come to take thee to thy pretty vicarage: art vicar
of Gouda, thanks to Heaven and thy good brother Giles; and mother and
I have made it so neat for thee, Gerard. `Tis well enow in winter I
promise thee. But bide a bit till the hawthorn bloom, and anon thy
walls put on their kirtle of brave roses, and sweet woodbine, Have we
forgotten thee, and the foolish things thou lovest? And, dear Gerard,
thy mother is waiting; and `tis late for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to be out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bed:
prithee, prithee, come! And the moment we are out of this foul hole I'll
show thee a treasure thou hast gotten, and knowest nought on't, or sure
hadst never fled from us so. Alas! what is to do? What have I ignorantly
said, to be regarded thus?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) had drawn himself all up into a heap, and was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with
a strange gaze of fear and suspicion blended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unhappy girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) solemnly, yet deeply agitated, <div class="bookquote">``would you have
me risk my soul and yours for a miserable vicarage and the flowers that

love thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, Gerard, you love me not or you would not have hidden from me;

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let there be no deceit between us twain, that have loved so true; and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now God forbid!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I love thee, and thou hast not forgotten me, or thou hadst married ere

me living neighbours, and feeding a passion innocent once, but now -LRB-so
Heaven wills it-RRB- impious and unholy? No, though my heart break I must be
firm. `Tis I that am the man, `tis I that am the priest. You and I must
meet no more, till I am schooled by solitude, and thou art wedded to
another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I consent to my doom but not to thine. I would ten times liever die;
yet I will marry, ay, wed misery itself sooner than let thee lie in

groaned; at each word she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) spoke out stood clearer and clearer two
things--his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) duty, and the agony it must cost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My beloved,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), with a strange mixture of tenderness and dogged
resolution, <div class="bookquote">``I bless thee for giving me one more sight of thy sweet

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Part, Gerard? Never: we have seen what comes of parting. Part? Why, you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may not. Thy very voice is a temptation with its music, memory's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I say you shall hear me, Gerard, for forth this place I go not

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then must we part by other means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alack! what other means? Wouldst put me to thine own door, being the
stronger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Margaret, well thou knowest I would suffer many deaths rather than

million times dearer to me are our immortal souls, both thine and mine.
I have withstood this direst temptation of all long enow. Now I must fly
it: farewell! farewell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) made to the door, and had actually opened it and got half out, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) darted after and caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) by the arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, then another must speak for me. I thought to reward thee for
yielding to me; but unkind that thou art, I need his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) help I find; turn
then this way one moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I say ay! And then turn thy back on us an thou canst.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) somewhat
relaxed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) grasp, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) would never deny her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) so small a favour.
But at this he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) opportunity and seized it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fly, Clement, fly!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) almost shrieked; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) religious enthusiasm
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) for a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) old strength, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) burst wildly away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>),
and after a few steps bounded over the little stream and ran beside it,
but finding he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was not followed stopped, and looked back.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was lying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands spread out.

<p/>Yes, without meaning it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) down and hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) saw that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) groaned and turned back a step; but suddenly, by
another impulse flung himself into the icy water instead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, kill my body!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``but save my soul!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) stood there, up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) throat in liquid ice, so to speak,
Margaret uttered one long, piteous moan, and rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knees.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) as plain almost as in midday. Saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pale face and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes
glistening; and then in the still night he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) heard these words:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, God! Thou that knowest all, Thou seest how I am used. Forgive me
then! For I will not live another day.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With this she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) suddenly started
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) feet, and flew like some wild creature, wounded to death,
close by his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) miserable hiding-place, shrieking:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``CRUEL!--CRUEL!--CRUEL!--CRUEL!''

 (<font color='red'><b>some creature</b></font>)</div><p/>What manifold anguish may burst from a human heart in a single syllable.
There were wounded love, and wounded pride, and despair, and coming
madness all in that piteous cry. Clement heard, and it froze his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) heart
with terror and remorse, worse than the icy water chilled the marrow of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) bones.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) from him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) for ever, and in the midst of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) dismal triumph, the greatest he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had won, there came an almost
incontrollable impulse to curse the Church, to curse religion itself,
for exacting such savage cruelty from mortal man. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crawled
half dead out of the water, and staggered to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) den. <div class="bookquote">``I am safe here,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) groaned; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) will never come near me again; unmanly, ungrateful
wretch that I am.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flung his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emaciated, frozen body down on the
floor, not without a secret hope that it might never rise thence alive.

<p/>But presently he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw by the hour-glass that it was past midnight.

<p/>On this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose slowly and took off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wet things, and moaning all
the time at the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved, put on the old hermit's
cilice of bristles, and over that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breastplate. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never worn
either of these before, doubting himself worthy to don the arms of that
tried soldier. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) must give himself every aid; the bristles
might distract his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) earthly remorse by bodily pain, and there might be
holy virtue in the breastplate. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) kneeled down and prayed God
humbly to release him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) that very night from the burden of the flesh. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) lighted all his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) candles, and recited his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) psalter doggedly; each word
seemed to come like a lump of lead from a leaden heart, and to fall
leaden to the ground; and in this mechanical office every now and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) moaned with all his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) soul. In the midst of which he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) suddenly observed
a little bundle in the corner he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had not seen before in the feebler
light, and at one end of it something like gold spun into silk.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) went to see what it could be; and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had no sooner viewed it closer,
than he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) hands with rapture. <div class="bookquote">``It is a seraph,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) whispered,
<div class="bookquote">``a lovely seraph. Heaven hath witnessed my bitter trial, and approves
my cruelty; and this flower of the skies is sent to cheer me, fainting
under my burden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) knees, and gazed with ecstasy on its golden hair, and its
tender skin, and cheeks like a peach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me feast my sad eyes on thee ere thou leavest me for thine
ever-blessed abode, and my cell darkens again at thy parting, as it did
at hers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>With all this, the hermit disturbed the lovely visitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) opened wide
two eyes, the colour of heaven; and seeing a strange figure kneeling
over him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) cried piteously, <div class="bookquote">``MUMMA! MUM-MA!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And the tears began to
run down his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) little cheeks.

<p/>Perhaps, after all, Clement, who for more than six months had not looked
on the human face divine, estimated childish beauty more justly than we
can; and in truth, this fair northern child, with its long golden hair,
was far more angelic than any of our imagined angels. But now the spell
was broken.

<p/>Yet not unhappily. Clement it may be remembered, was fond of children,
and true monastic life fosters this sentiment. The innocent distress on
the cherubic face, the tears that ran so smoothly from those transparent
violets, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) pretty, dismal cry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) only friend, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
mother, went through the hermit's heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) employed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) gentleness
and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) art to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>); and as the little soul was wonderfully
intelligent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) age, presently succeeded so far that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) ceased to
cry out, and wonder took the place of fear; while, in silence, broken
only in little gulps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) scanned, with great tearful eyes, this strange
figure that looked so wild, but spoke so kindly, and wore armour, yet
did not kill little boys, but coaxed them. Clement was equally perplexed
to know how this little human flower came to lie sparkling and blooming
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) gloomy cave. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) remembered he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had left the door wide open,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was driven to conclude that, owing to this negligence, some
unfortunate creature of high or low degree had seized this opportunity
to get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) child for ever.-LRB-1-RRB-. At this his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) bowels yearned so over
the poor deserted cherub, that the tears of pure tenderness stood in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes, and still, beneath the crime of the mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) saw the divine
goodness, which had so directed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heartlessness as to comfort His (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
servant's breaking heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now bless thee, bless thee, bless thee, sweet innocent, I would not
change thee for e'en a cherub in heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At's pooty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the infant</b></font>)</div>replied the infant, ignoring contemptuously, after the
manner of infants, all remarks that did not interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is pretty here, my love, besides thee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ookum-gars,-LRB-2-RRB- said the boy, pointing to the hermit's breastplate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quot liberi, tot sententiunculae!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hector</b></font>)</div>Hector's child screamed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>)
father's glittering casque and nodding crest; and here was a mediaeval
babe charmed with a polished cuirass, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) griefs assuaged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are prettier things here than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement, <div class="bookquote">``there are
little birds; lovest thou birds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay. Ay. En um ittle, ery ittle? Not ike torks. Hate torks um bigger an
baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) then confided, in very broken language, that the storks with their
great flapping wings scared him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), and were a great trouble and worry to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), darkening his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) existence more or less.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but my birds are very little, and good, and oh, so pretty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Den I ikes `m,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child authoritatively, <div class="bookquote">``I ont my mammy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, sweet dove! I doubt I shall have to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) place as best I may.
Hast thou no daddy as well as mammy, sweet one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ages situations circumstances</b></font>)</div><p/>Now not only was this conversation from first to last, the relative
ages, situations, and all circumstances of the parties considered, as
strange a one as ever took place between two mortal creatures, but at
or within a second or two of the hermit's last question, to turn the
strange into the marvellous, came an unseen witness, to whom every
word that passed carried ten times the force it did to either of the
speakers.

<p/>Since, therefore, it is with her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) eyes you must now see, and hear with
her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) ears, I go back a step for her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>).

<p/>Margaret, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ran past Gerard, was almost mad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was in that
state of mind in which affectionate mothers have been known to kill
their children, sometimes along with themselves, sometimes alone, which
last is certainly maniacal, She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ran to Reicht Heynes pale and trembling,
and clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) round the neck, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Reicht! oh, Reicht!''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>and could say
no more.

<p/>Reicht kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and began to whimper; and would you believe it, the
great mastiff uttered one long whine: even his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) glimmer of sense taught
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) grief was afoot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Reicht!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>moaned the despised beauty, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could utter a
word for choking, <div class="bookquote">``see how he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) has served me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands,
that were bleeding with falling on the stony ground. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) threw me down,
he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) was so eager to fly from me, He (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) took me for a devil; he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) said I came
to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>). Am I the woman to tempt a man? you know me, Reicht.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, in sooth, sweet Mistress Margaret, the last i' the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not look at my child. I'll fling myself and him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My child! where is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Why, Reicht, I have left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behind. Oh, shame!

I am rightly served for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sat down, and faithful Reicht beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and they sobbed in one
another's arms.

<p/>After a while Margaret left off sobbing and said doggedly, <div class="bookquote">``let us go
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but the bairn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is well where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is. My heart is turned against my very child,

mine; let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keep it awhile: mayhap that will learn him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to think more

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``High words off an empty stomach,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time will show. Come you home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They departed, and Time did show quicker than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) levels abbeys, for at
the second step Margaret stopped, and could neither go one way nor the
other, but stood stock still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Reicht,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) piteously, <div class="bookquote">``what else have I on earth? I cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div><p/>Reicht led the way, and Margaret followed readily enough in that
direction; but as they drew near the cell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) stopped again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Reicht, go you and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) give me back my boy; for I could

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is not far off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht Heynes; but somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not
say it with alacrity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak not to me of any man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret bitterly; <div class="bookquote">``I hate them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the sake of one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Flout me not, but prithee go forward, and get me what is my own, my
sole joy in the world. Thou knowest I am on thorns till I have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to my
bosom again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Reicht went forward; Margaret sat by the roadside and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) apron, and rocked herself after the manner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) country, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) soul was full of bitterness and grief. So severe, indeed, was the
internal conflict, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not hear Reicht running back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and
started violently when the young woman laid a hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mistress Margaret!''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht quietly, <div class="bookquote">``take a fool's advice that
loves ye. Go softly to yon cave, wi' all the ears and eyes your mother
ever gave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? Reicht?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>stammered Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought the cave was afire, `twas so light inside; and there were
voices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Voices?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, not one, but twain, and all unlike--a man's and a little child's
talking as pleasant as you and me. I am no great hand at a keyhole for
my part, `tis paltry work; but if so be voices were a talking in yon
cave, and them that owned those voices were so near to me as those are
to thee, I'd go on all fours like a fox, and I'd crawl on my belly like
a serpent, ere I'd lose one word that passes atwixt those twain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whisht, Reicht! Bless thee! Bide thou here. Buss me! Pray for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>And almost ere the agitated words had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lips, Margaret was flying
towards the hermitage as noiselessly as a lapwing.

<p/>Arrived near it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) crouched, and there was something truly serpentine
in the gliding, flexible, noiseless movements by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) reached the
very door, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found a chink, and listened. And often it cost
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) a struggle not to burst in upon them; but warned by defeat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was
cautious, and resolute, let well alone, And after a while, slowly and
noiselessly she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) reared her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head, like a snake its crest, to where she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
saw the broadest chink of all, and looked with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes and soul, as
well as listened.

<p/>The little boy then being asked whether he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had no daddy, at first shook
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, and would say nothing; but being pressed he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suddenly seemed to
remember something, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Dad-da ill man; run away and left poor
mum-ma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) who heard this winced. It was as new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) as to Clement. Some
interfering foolish woman had gone and said this to the boy, and now out
it came in Gerard's very face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) answer surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) burst out,
<div class="bookquote">``The villain! the monster! he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) must be born without bowels to desert
thee, sweet one, Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) little knows the joy he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) has turned his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) back on.
Well, my little dove, I must be father and mother to thee, since the one
runs away, and t'other abandons thee to my care. Now to-morrow I shall
ask the good people that bring me my food to fetch some nice eggs
and milk for thee as well; for bread is good enough for poor old

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hast none other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I do to pleasure thee, baby? Shall I tell thee a story?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ikes tories,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or sing thee a song?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ikes tongs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) became excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Choose then, a song or a story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ting I a tong. Nay, tell I a tory. Nay, ting I a tong. Nay--And the
corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ting</b></font>) little mouth turned down and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ting</b></font>) had half a mind to weep
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ting</b></font>) could not have both, and could not tell which to forego.
Suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Ting</b></font>) little face cleared: <div class="bookquote">``Ting I a tory,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sing thee a story, baby? Well, after all, why not? And wilt thou sit o'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yea.''

I put on my best pelisse, in honour of thy worshipful visit. See how

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am right glad on't. Now list the story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chanted a child's story in a sort of recitative, singing a little
moral refrain now and then. The boy listened with rapture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ikes oo,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Ot is oo? is oo a man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, little heart, and a great sinner to boot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ikes great tingers. Ting one other tory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ubbs vermins. Ting other one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But during this final performance, Nature suddenly held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) leaden
sceptre over the youthful eyelids. <div class="bookquote">``I is not eepy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whined he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) very
faintly, and succumbed.

<p/>Clement laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) psaltery softly and began to rock his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) new treasure
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) arms, and to crone over him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) a little lullaby well known in
Tergou, with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) own mother had often sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) off.

<p/>And the child sank into a profound sleep upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) arm. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) stopped
croning and gazed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) with infinite tenderness, yet sadness; for at
that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) could not help thinking what might have been but for a
piece of paper with a lie in it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) sighed deeply.

<p/>The next moment the moonlight burst into his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) cell, and with it, and in
it, and almost as swift as it, Margaret Brandt was down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) knee with
a timorous hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>CHAPTER XCV

<p/>The startled hermit glared from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) nurseling to Margaret, and from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), in amazement, equalled only by his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) agitation at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) so
unexpected return. The child lay asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) left arm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) right knee; no longer the pale, scared, panting girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had
overpowered so easily an hour or two ago, but an imperial beauty, with
blushing cheeks and sparkling eyes, and lips sweetly parted in triumph,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whole face radiant with a look he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) could not quite read; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
had never yet seen it on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): maternal pride.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) stared and stared from the child to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), in throbbing amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) gasped at last. And still his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) wonder-stricken eyes turned to
and fro.

<p/>Margaret was surprised in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turn, It was an age of impressions not
facts, <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``doth not a father know his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own child? and a
man of God, too? Fie, Gerard, to pretend! nay, thou art too wise, too
good, not to have--why, I watched thee; and e'en now look at you twain!
`Tis thine own flesh and blood thou holdest to thine heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement trembled, <div class="bookquote">``What words are these,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) stammered, <div class="bookquote">``this angel
mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose else? since he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) is mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement turned on the sleeping child, with a look beyond the power of
the pen to describe, and trembled all over, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) eyes seemed to absorb
the little love.

<p/>Margaret's eyes followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) is not a bit like me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
proudly; <div class="bookquote">``but oh, at whiles he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) is thy very image in little; and see this
golden hair. Thine was the very colour at his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) age; ask mother else. And
see this mole on his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) little finger; now look at thine own; there! `Twas
thy mother let me weet thou wast marked so before him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>); and oh, Gerard,
`twas this our child found thee for me; for by that little mark on thy
finger I knew thee for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) father, when I watched above thy window and
saw thee feed the birds.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) seized the child's hand, and kissed
it eagerly, and got half of it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mouth, Heaven knows how, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
bless thee, thou didst find thy poor daddy for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and now thou hast
made us friends again after our little quarrel; the first, the last.
Wast very cruel to me but now, my poor Gerard, and I forgive thee; for
loving of thy child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement</b></font>)</div>sobbed Clement, choking. And lowered by fasts,
and unnerved by solitude, the once strong man was hysterical, and nearly
fainting.

<p/>Margaret was alarmed, but having experience, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pity was greater than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fear. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, take not on so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) murmured soothingly, and put a
gentle hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brow. <div class="bookquote">``Be brave! So, so. Dear heart, thou art not
the first man that hath gone abroad and come back richer by a lovely
little self than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went forth. Being a man of God, take courage, and
say He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sends thee this to comfort thee for what thou hast lost in me;
and that is not so very much, my lamb; for sure the better part of love
shall ne’er cool here to thee; though it may in thine, and ought, being
a priest, and parson of Gouda.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? priest of Gouda? Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>murmured Clement in a faint voice; <div class="bookquote">``I am
a friar of St. Dominic: yet speak on, sweet music, tell me all that has
happened thee, before we are parted again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Now some would on this have exclaimed against parting at all, and raised
the true question in dispute. But such women as Margaret do not repeat
their mistakes. It is very hard to defeat them twice, where their hearts
are set on a thing.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) assented, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) back on Gouda manse as a thing not to
be recurred to; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tale, dwelling above all on the
kindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) parents; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) related her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) troubles, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hand stole to hers, and often she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wince and tremble with ire,
and often press her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand, sympathizing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in every vein.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, piteous tale of a true heart battling alone against such bitter
odds,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It all seems small, when I see thee here again, and nursing my boy. We
have had a warning, Gerard. True friends like you and me are rare, and
they are mad to part, ere death divideth them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement, off his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) guard.

<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had suffered for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to excuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) consented; but by questions quietly
revoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) consent and elicited it all; and many a sigh she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heaved for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), and more than once she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands with terror at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
perils, though past. And to console him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) had gone through,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) kneeled down and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms under the little boy, and lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
gently up. <div class="bookquote">``Kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) softly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Again, again kiss thy fill
if thou canst; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is sound. `Tis all I can do to comfort thee till thou
art out of this foul den and in thy sweet manse yonder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``let that pass. Know that I have been sore affronted
for want of my lines.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who hath dared affront thee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter, those that will do it again if thou hast lost them, which
the saints forbid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I lose them? nay, there they lie, close to thy hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where, where, oh, where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/>Clement hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Look in the Vulgate. Heaven forgive me: I
thought thou wert dead, and a saint in heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) looked, and on the blank leaves of the poor soul's Vulgate she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) marriage lines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``thank God! Oh, bless thee, Gerard, bless thee!
Why, what is here, Gerard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On the other leaves were pinned every scrap of paper she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had ever sent
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), and their two names she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had once written together in sport, and
the lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hair she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), and half a silver coin she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
broken with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), and a straw she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had sucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) soup with the first day
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) ever saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>When Margaret saw these proofs of love and signs of a gentle heart
bereaved, even her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) exultation at getting back her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) marriage lines was
overpowered by gushing tenderness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) almost staggered, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand
went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bosom, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brow against the stone cell and
wept so silently that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) did not see she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was weeping; indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would
not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt that to befriend him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) now she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must be the
stronger; and emotion weakens.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I know you are wise and good. You must have a
reason for what you are doing, let it seem ever so unreasonable. Talk we
like old friends. Why are you buried alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret, to escape temptation. My impious ire against those two had
its root in the heart; that heart then I must deaden, and, Dei gratia, I
shall. Shall I, a servant of Christ and of the Church, court temptation?
Shall I pray daily to be led out on't, and walk into it with open eyes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is good sense anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, with a consummate
affectation of candour.

<p/>```Tis unanswerable,'' said Clement, with a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall see. Tell me, have you escaped temptation here? Why I ask
is, when I am alone, my thoughts are far more wild and foolish than in
company. Nay, speak sooth; come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must needs own I have been worse tempted here with evil imaginations

she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was, till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) watched a man in like plight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I grant humility and a teachable spirit are the roads to wisdom;

Oh! how shallow are the wise, and how little able are you to read me,

but Kate would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>); and one very ancient woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said to thy

He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) may have a bee in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) bonnet, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is not a hypocrite, a thing all

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard literally staggered where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat at this tremendous thrust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me for nagging,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Thy mother too is waiting for thee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At Gouda manse, wearing the night in prayer and care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Margaret saw the time was come for that appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
had purposely reserved till persuasion should have paved the way for
conviction. So the smith first softens the iron by fire, and then brings
down the sledge hammer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>), but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own good straightforward Dutch, that his (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>)
present life was only a higher kind of selfishness, spiritual egotism;
whereas a priest had no more right to care only for his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) own soul than
only for his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) own body. That was not his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) path to heaven. <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``whoever yet lost his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) soul by saving the souls of others! the Almighty

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard was struck by this remark. <div class="bookquote">``Art shrewd in dispute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Far from it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply, <div class="bookquote">``only my eyes are not bandaged with

him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) skulked in a hole and shunned the battle because forsooth
in battle is danger as well as glory and duty. For thy sole excuse is
fear; thou makest no secret on't, Go to, no duke nor king hath such
cowardly soldiers as Christ hath. What was that you said in the church
at Rotterdam about the man in the parable that buried his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talent in the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And hast thou laid it out? or buried it? To whom hast thou preached

<p/>``Do you remember, Gerard, when we were young together, which now are old
before our time, as we walked handed in the fields, did you but see a

her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) good will-RRB- and run and lift the sheep for charity? Well, then, at
Gouda is not one sheep in evil plight, but a whole flock; some cast,
some strayed, some sick, some tainted, some a being devoured, and all
for the want of a shepherd. Where is their shepherd? lurking in a den

your own young? Birds need but bodily food, and having wings, deserve
scant pity if they cannot fly and find it. But that sweet dove upon thy
knee, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needeth not carnal only, but spiritual food. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is thine as

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard started and stammered an affirmation. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), ``to hear me quote holy writ so glib. I have

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then hearken it, and come forth to Gouda manse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The battle was won.

<p/>Margaret lingered behind, cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eye rapidly round the furniture, and
selected the Vulgate and the psaltery. The rest she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sighed at, and let
it lie. The breastplate and the cilice of bristles she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took and dashed
with feeble ferocity on the floor.

<p/>Then seeing Gerard watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with surprise from the outside,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) coloured and said, ``I am but a woman: `little' will still be
`spiteful.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why encumber thyself with those? They are safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And with this they took the road to Gouda parsonage, The moon and stars
were so bright, it seemed almost as light as day.

<p/>Suddenly Gerard stopped. <div class="bookquote">``My poor little birds!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will miss their food. I feed them every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The child hath a piece of bread in his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) cowl, Take that, and feed them
now against the morn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will. Nay, I will not, He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) is as innocent, and nearer to me and to

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret drew a long breath, ```Tis well, Hadst taken it, I might have
hated thee; I am but a woman.''

<p/>When they had gone about a quarter of a mile, Gerard sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I must e'en rest; he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) is too heavy for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then give him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) me, and take thou these. Alas! alas! I mind when thou
wouldst have run with the child on one shoulder, and the mother on
t'other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>And Margaret carried the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, looking down, <div class="bookquote">``overmuch fasting is not good for a

<p/>Gerard pondered these simple words, and eyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) askant, carrying the
child with perfect ease. When they had gone nearly a mile he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said with
considerable surprise, <div class="bookquote">``You thought it was but two butts' length.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you said so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is another matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) then turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) the face of a Madonna.
<div class="bookquote">``I lied,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) sweetly. <div class="bookquote">``And to save your soul and body, I'd maybe

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without a lie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! Three, without a lie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And sure enough, in a few minutes they came up to the manse.

<p/>A candle was burning in the vicar's parlour. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is waking still,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>whispered Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beautiful! beautiful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement, and stopped to look at it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, in Heaven's name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That little candle, seen through the window at night. Look an it be

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, and I'll show thee something better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)

soul. And I see she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been weeping e'en now; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will have given thee
up, being so late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me get to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement hastily, trembling all over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That door! I will bide here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>When Gerard was gone to the door, Margaret, fearing the sudden surprise,
gave one sharp tap at the window and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>in a loud,
expressive voice that Catherine read at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands
together and had half risen from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kneeling posture when the door
burst open and Clement flung himself wildly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) knees at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knees,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) arms out to embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) uttered a cry such as only a
mother could, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! my darling, my darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>a mother</b></font>)</div>and clung sobbing round his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>)
neck. And true it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw neither a hermit, a priest, nor a monk,
but just her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) child, lost, and despaired of, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arms, And after a
little while Margaret came in, with wet eyes and cheeks, and a holy calm
of affection settled by degrees on these sore troubled ones. And
they sat all three together, hand in hand, murmuring sweet and loving
converse; and he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) who sat in the middle drank right and left their true
affection and their humble but genuine wisdom, and was forced to eat a
good nourishing meal, and at daybreak was packed off to a snowy bed,
and by and by awoke, as from a hideous dream, friar and hermit no more,
Clement no more, but Gerard Eliassoen, parson of Gouda.

<p/>-LRB-1-RRB- I think she (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) means prejudice.



<p/>CHAPTER XCVI

<p/>Margaret went back to Rotterdam long ere Gerard awoke, and actually left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sent the faithful, sturdy Reicht off to Gouda
directly with a vicar's grey frock and large felt hat, and with minute
instructions how to govern her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) new master.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went to Jorian Ketel; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is the
closest I ever met, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) is the man for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and in concert with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did two mortal sly things; yet not, in my opinion, virulent, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thought they were; but if I am asked what were these deeds without
a name, the answer is, that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), who was, `but a woman,' kept them
secret till her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dying day, I, who am a man--<div class="bookquote">``Verbum non amplius addam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kept away from Gouda parsonage.

<p/>Things that pass little noticed in the heat of argument sometimes rankle
afterwards; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came to go over all that had passed, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
offended at Gerard thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could ever forget the priest in the some
time lover, <div class="bookquote">``For what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) take me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the some time lover</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). And this raised a great
shyness which really she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not otherwise have felt, being downright
innocent, And pride sided with modesty, and whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Go no more to
Gouda parsonage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left little Gerard there to complete the conquest her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) maternal heart
ascribed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), not to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own eloquence and sagacity, and to anchor
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) father for ever to humanity.

<p/>But this generous stroke of policy cost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart dear. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never
yet been parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) boy an hour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt sadly strange as well
as desolate without him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). After the first day it became intolerable; and
what does the poor soul do, but creep at dark up to Gouda parsonage, and
lurk about the premises like a thief till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw Reicht Heynes in the
kitchen alone, Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tapped softly at the window and said, <div class="bookquote">``Reicht,
for pity's sake bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) out to me unbeknown.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With Margaret the person
who occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thoughts at the time ceased to have a name, and sank to
a pronoun.

<p/>Reicht soon found an excuse for taking little Gerard out, and there was
a scene of mutual rapture, followed by mutual tears when mother and boy
parted again.

<p/>And it was arranged that Reicht should take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) half way to Rotterdam
every day, at a set hour, and Margaret meet them. And at these meetings,
after the raptures, and after mother and child had gambolled together
like a young cat and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) first kitten, the boy would sometimes amuse
himself alone at their feet, and the two women generally seized this
opportunity to talk very seriously about Luke Peterson, This began thus:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Reicht,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke Peterson</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, ``I as good as promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to marry Luke
Peterson. `Say you the word,' quoth I, `and I'll wed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peterson</b></font>).'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Luke!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prithee, why poor Luke?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be bandied about so, atwixt yea and nay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Reicht, you have not ever been so simple as to cast an eye of
affection on the boy, that you take his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) part?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht, with a toss of the head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I ask your pardon. Well, then, you can do me a good turn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whisht! whisper! that little darling is listening to every word, and
eyes like saucers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>On this both their heads would have gone under one cap.

<p/>Two women plotting against one boy? Oh, you great cowardly serpents!

<p/>But when these stolen meetings had gone on for about five days Margaret
began to feel the injustice of it, and to be irritated as well as
unhappy.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was crying about it when a cart came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) door, and in it,
clean as a new penny, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) beard close shaved, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands white as snow,
and a little colour in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pale face, sat the Vicar of Gouda in the grey
frock and large felt hat she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ran upstairs directly, and washed away all traces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tears,
and put on a cap, which being just taken out of the drawer was cleaner,
theoretically, than the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had on, and came down to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seized both her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands and kissed them, and a tear fell upon them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head away at that to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own which started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sweet Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``why is this? Why hold you aloof from
your own good deed? we have been waiting for you every day, and no
Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! when I was a hermit, and a donkey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! no matter, you said things. And you had no reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forget all I said there. Who hearkens the ravings of a maniac? for I
see now that in a few months more I should have been a gibbering idiot;
yet no mortal could have persuaded me away but you. Oh what an outlay of
wit and goodness was yours! But it is not here I can thank and bless
you as I ought. No, it is in the home you have given me, among the sheep
whose shepherd you have made me; already I love them dearly; there it
is I must thank `the truest friend ever man had.' So now I say to you as
erst you said to me, come to Gouda manse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! we will see about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Margaret, think you I had ever kept the dear child so long, but
that I made sure you would be back to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) from day to day? Oh he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) curls
round my very heartstrings, but what is my title to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) compared to
thine? Confess now, thou hast had hard thoughts of me for this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, not I. Ah! thou art thyself again; wast ever thoughtful of
others. I have half a mind to go to Gouda manse, for your saying that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come then, with half thy mind, `tis worth the whole of other folk's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I dare say I will; but there is no such mighty hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
coolly -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was literally burning to go-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me first how you agree
with your folk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, already my poor have taken root in my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought as much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And there are such good creatures among them; simple and rough, and
superstitious, but wonderfully good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I leave you alone for seeing a grain of good among a bushel of ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whisht! whisht! And Margaret, two of them have been ill friends for
four years, and came to the manse each to get on my blind side. But give
the glory to God I got on their bright side, and made them friends, and
laugh at themselves for their folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But are you in very deed their vicar? answer me that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certes; have I not been to the bishop and taken the oath, and rung the
church bell, and touched the altar, the missal, and the holy cup before
the church-wardens? And they have handed me the parish seal; see, here
it is. Nay, `tis a real vicar inviting a true friend to Gouda manse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then my mind is at ease. Tell me oceans more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sweet one, nearest to me of all my parish is a poor cripple that
my guardian angel and his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) name thou knowest even by this turning of
thy head away-RRB- hath placed beneath my roof. Sybrandt and I are that we
never were till now, brothers. `Twould gladden thee, yet sadden thee to
hear how we kissed and forgave one another. He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) is full of thy praises,
and wholly in a pious mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) is happier since his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) trouble than
e'er he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) was in the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) strength. Oh! out of my house he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) ne’er
shall go to any place but heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me somewhat that happened thyself, poor soul! All this is good,
but yet no tidings to me. Do I not know thee of old?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let me see. At first I was much dazzled by the sun-light,
and could not go abroad -LRB-owl!-RRB-, but that is passed; and good Reicht
Heynes--humph!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This to thine ear only, for she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is a diamond. Her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) voice goes through
me like a knife, and all voices seem loud but thine, which is so mellow
sweet. Stay, now I'll fit ye with tidings; I spake yesterday with an old
man that conceits he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is ill-tempered, and sweats to pass for such with
others, but oh! so threadbare, and the best good heart beneath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, `tis a parish of angels,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret ironically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why dost thou keep out on't?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>retorted Gerard. ``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
telling me there was no parish in Holland where the devil hath such
power as at Gouda; and among his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) instances, says he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), `We had a hermit,
the holiest in Holland; but being Gouda, the devil came for him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) this
week, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), bag and baggage; not a ha'porth of him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) left but a
goodish piece of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) skin, just for all the world like a hedgehog's, and
a piece o' old iron furbished up.'''

<p/>Margaret smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>continued Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``the strange thing is, the cave has verily
fallen in; and had I been so perverse as resist thee, it had assuredly
buried me dead there where I had buried myself alive. Therefore in
this I see the finger of Providence, condemning my late, approving my
present, way of life. What sayest thou?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, can I pierce the like mysteries? I am but a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Somewhat more, methinks. This very tale proves thee my guardian angel,
and all else avouches it, so come to Gouda manse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, go you on, I'll follow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, in the cart with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I tell why and wherefore, being a woman? All I know is I seem--to
feel--to wish--to come alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it then. I leave thee the cart, being, as thou sayest, a woman,
and I'll go a-foot, being a man again, with the joyful tidings of thy
coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>When Margaret reached the manse the first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw was the two
Gerards together, the son performing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) capriccios on the plot, and the
father slouching on a chair, in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) great hat, with pencil and paper,
trying very patiently to sketch him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).

<p/>After a warm welcome he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) attempts. <div class="bookquote">``But in vain I strive
to fix him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is incarnate quick silver, Yet do but note
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) changes, infinite, but none ungracious; all is supple and easy; and
how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) melteth from one posture to another,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) added presently, <div class="bookquote">``Woe to
illuminators I looking on thee, sir baby, I see what awkward, lopsided,
ungainly toads I and my fellows painted missals with, and called them
cherubs and seraphs,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) threw the paper away in despair, and
Margaret conveyed it secretly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bosom.

<p/>At night when they sat round the peat fire he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bade them observe how
beautiful the brass candlesticks and other glittering metals were in
the glow from the hearth. Catherine's eyes sparkled at this observation,
<div class="bookquote">``And oh the sheets I lie in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``often my conscience
pricketh me, and saith, `Who art thou to lie in lint like web of snow?'
Dives was ne’er so flaxed as I. And to think that there are folk in
the world that have all the beautiful things which I have here yet not
content. Let them pass six months in a hermit's cell, seeing no face of
man, then will they find how lovely and pleasant this wicked world is,
and eke that men and women are God's fairest creatures. Margaret was
always fair, but never to my eye so bright as now.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Margaret shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
head incredulously, Gerard continued, <div class="bookquote">``My mother was ever good and kind,
but I noted not her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exceeding comeliness till now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``a score years ago I might pass in a
crowd, but not now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard declared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that each age had its beauty. <div class="bookquote">``See this mild grey
eye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that hath looked motherly love upon so many of us,
all that love hath left its shadow, and that shadow is a beauty which
defieth Time. See this delicate lip, these pure white teeth. See this
well-shaped brow, where comliness Just passeth into reverence. Art
beautiful in my eyes, mother dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that is enough for me, my darling, `Tis time you were in bed,
child. Ye have to preach the morn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div><p/>And Reicht Heynes and Catherine interchanged a look which said, <div class="bookquote">``We two
have an amiable maniac to superintend; calls everything beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day was Sunday, and they heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) preach in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own church. It
was crammed with persons, who came curious, but remained devout. Never
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) wonderful gift displayed more powerfully; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was himself deeply
moved by the first sight of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) people, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) bowels yearned over
this flock he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had so long neglected. In a single sermon, which lasted
two hours and seemed to last but twenty minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) declared the whole
scripture: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) terrified the impenitent and thoughtless, confirmed the
wavering, consoled the bereaved and the afflicted, uplifted the heart
of the poor, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ended, left the multitude standing rapt, and
unwilling to believe the divine music of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) voice and soul had ceased.

<p/>Need I say that two poor women in a corner sat entranced, with streaming
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wherever gat he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) it all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>whispered Catherine, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) apron to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
eyes. <div class="bookquote">``By our Lady not from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as they were by themselves Margaret threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms round
Catherine's neck and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, mother, I am not quite a happy woman, but oh I am a proud one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) vowed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knees never by word or deed to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) love come
between this young saint and Heaven.

<p/>Reader, did you ever stand by the seashore after a storm, when the wind
happens to have gone down suddenly? The waves cannot cease with their
cause; indeed, they seem at first to the ear to lash the sounding shore
more fiercely than while the wind blew. Still we are conscious that
inevitable calm has begun, and is now but rocking them to sleep. So it
was with those true and tempest-tossed lovers from that eventful night
when they went hand in hand beneath the stars from Gouda hermitage to
Gouda manse.

<p/>At times a loud wave would every now and then come roaring, but it was
only memory's echo of the tempest that had swept their lives; the storm
itself was over, and the boiling waters began from that moment to go
down, down, down, gently, but inevitably.

<p/>This image is to supply the place of interminable details that would be
tedious and tame. What best merits attention at present is the general
situation, and the strange complication of feeling that arose from it.
History itself, though a far more daring story-teller than romance,
presents few things so strange-LRB-1-RRB- as the footing on which Gerard and
Margaret now lived for many years. United by present affection, past
familiarity, and a marriage irregular but legal; separated by Holy
Church and by their own consciences, which sided unreservedly with
Holy Church; separated by the Church, but united by a living pledge of
affection, lawful in every sense at its date.

<p/>And living but a few miles from one another, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mother
<div class="bookquote">``mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>For some years she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) always took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy to Gouda on Sunday,
returning home at dark, Go when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would, it was always fete at Gouda
manse, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was received like a little queen. Catherine in these days
was nearly always with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and Eli very often, Tergou had so little to
tempt them compared with Rotterdam; and at last they left it altogether,
and set up in the capital.

<p/>And thus the years glided; so barren now of striking incidents, so void
of great hopes, and free from great fears, and so like one another,
that without the help of dates I could scarcely indicate the progress of
time.

<p/>However, early next year, 1471, the Duchess of Burgundy, with the open
dissent, but secret connivance of the Duke, raised forces to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)
dethroned brother, Edward the Fourth of England, to invade that kingdom;
our old friend Denys thus enlisted, and passing through Rotterdam to the
ships, heard on his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) way that Gerard was a priest, and Margaret alone. On
this he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) told Margaret that marriage was not a habit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), but that as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) comrade had put it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own power to keep troth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) felt bound
to offer to keep it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``for a comrade's honour is dear to us as
our own,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) stared, then smiled, <div class="bookquote">``I choose rather to be still thy she-comrade,''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``closer acquainted, we might not agree so well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
character of she-comrade she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) equipped him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) with a new sword of Antwerp
make, and a double handful of silver. <div class="bookquote">``I give thee no gold,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``for `tis thrown away as quick as silver, and harder to win back. Heaven
send thee safe out of all thy perils; there be famous fair women yonder
to beguile thee, with their faces, as well as men to hash thee with
their axes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was hurried on board at La Vere, and never saw Gerard at that time.

<p/>In 1473 Sybrandt began to fail. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) pitiable existence had been
sweetened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) brother's inventive tenderness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own contented
spirit, which, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) antecedents considered, was truly remarkable, As for
Gerard, the day never passed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did not devote two hours to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>);
reading or singing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), praying with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) about in a
soft carriage Margaret and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had made between them. When the poor soul
found his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) end near, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) begged Margaret might be sent for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came
at once, and almost with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) last breath he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sought once more that
forgiveness she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had long ago accorded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remained by him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) till the
last; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) died, blessing and blessed, in the arms of the two true
lovers he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had parted for life. Tantum religio scit suadere boni.

<p/>1474 there was a wedding in Margaret's house, Luke Peterson and Reicht
Heynes.

<p/>This may seem less strange if I give the purport of the dialogue
interrupted some time back.

<p/>Margaret went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``Then in that case you can easily make him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
fancy you, and for my sake you must, for my conscience it pricketh me,
and I must needs fit him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with a wife, the best I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>Margaret then
instructed Reicht to be always kind and good-humoured to Luke; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
would be a model of peevishness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``But be not thou so simple as
run me down,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Leave that to me. Make thou excuses for me; I
will make myself black enow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Reicht received these instructions like an order to sweep a room, and
obeyed them punctually.

<p/>When they had subjected poor Luke to this double artillery for a couple
of years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) got to look upon Margaret as his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) fog and wind, and Reicht
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) sunshine; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) affections transferred themselves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) scarce
knew how or when.

<p/>On the wedding day Reicht embraced Margaret, and thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) almost
with tears. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was always my fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``from the first hour I
clapped eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heyday, you never told me that. What, Reicht, are you as sly as the
rest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div>said Reicht eagerly; <div class="bookquote">``but I never thought you would really
part with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to me. In my country the mistress looks to be served
before the maid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reicht/Reicht Heynes</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret settled them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) shop, and gave them half the profits.

<p/>1476 and 7 were years of great trouble to Gerard, whose conscience
compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to oppose the Pope. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) Holiness, siding with the Grey
Friars in their determination to swamp every palpable distinction
between the Virgin Mary and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Son, bribed the Christian world into his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>)
crotchet by proffering pardon of all sins to such as would add to
the Ave Mary this clause: <div class="bookquote">``and blessed be thy Mother Anna, from whom,
without blot of sin, proceeded thy virgin flesh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Ave Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard, in common with many of the northern clergy, held this sentence
to be flat heresy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) not only refused to utter it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) church, but
warned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) parishioners against using it in private; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) refused to
celebrate the new feast the Pope invented at the same time, viz., <div class="bookquote">``the
feast of the miraculous conception of the Virgin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Pope</b></font>)</div><p/>But this drew upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) the bitter enmity of the Franciscans, and they
were strong enough to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) into more than one serious difficulty, and
inflict many a little mortification on him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>). In emergencies he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) consulted
Margaret, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) always did one of two things, either she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I do
not see my way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and refused to guess; or else she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) advice that
proved wonderfully sagacious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had genius, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had marvellous
tact.

<p/>And where affection came in and annihilated the woman's judgment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)
stepped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) turn to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) aid. Thus though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was spoiling
little Gerard, and Catherine was ruining him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) for life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would not
part with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), but kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) at home, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) abilities uncultivated. And
there was a shrewd boy of nine years, instead of learning to work
and obey, playing about and learning selfishness from their infinite
unselfishness, and tyrannizing with a rod of iron over two women, both
of them sagacious and spirited, but reduced by their fondness for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to
the exact level of idiots.

<p/>Gerard saw this with pain, and interfered with mild but firm
remonstrance; and after a considerable struggle prevailed, and got
little Gerard sent to the best school in Europe, kept by one Haaghe at
Deventer: this was in 1477. Many tears were shed, but the great progress
the boy made at that famous school reconciled Margaret in some degree,
and the fidelity of Reicht Heynes, now her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) partner in business, enabled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to spend weeks at a time hovering over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy at Deventer.

<p/>And so the years glided; and these two persons, subjected to as strong
and constant a temptation as can well be conceived, were each other's
guardian angels, and not each other's tempters.

<p/>To be sure the well-greased morality of the next century, which taught
that solemn vows to God are sacred in proportion as they are reasonable,
had at that time entered no single mind; and the alternative to these
two minds was self-denial or sacrilege.

<p/>It was a strange thing to hear them talk with unrestrained tenderness to
one another of their boy, and an icy barrier between themselves all the
time.

<p/>Eight years had now passed thus, and Gerard, fairly compared with men in
general, was happy.

<p/>But Margaret was not.

<p/>The habitual expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face was a sweet pensiveness, but
sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was irritable and a little petulant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) even snapped
Gerard now and then. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), if a monk was with
him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) back and go home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hated the monks for having
parted Gerard and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) inoculated her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy with a contempt for
them which lasted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) till his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) dying day.

<p/>Gerard bore with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) like an angel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heart of gold, and hoped
this ill gust would blow over.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) himself being now the right man in the right place this many years,
loving his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) parishioners, and beloved by them, and occupied from morn
till night in good works, recovered the natural cheerfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
disposition. To tell the truth, a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) jocoseness was a blind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
was the greatest peace-maker, except Mr. Harmony in the play, that ever
was born. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) reconciled more enemies in ten years than his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) predecessors
had done in three hundred; and one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) manoeuvres in the peacemaking
art was to make the quarrellers laugh at the cause of quarrel. So did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) undermine the demon of discord. But independently of that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) really
loved a harmless joke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was a wonderful tamer of animals, squirrels,
bares, fawns, etc.. So half in jest a parishioner who had a mule supposed
to be possessed with a devil gave it him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``Tame this vagabone,
parson, if ye can.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Well, in about six months, Heaven knows how, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
not only tamed Jack, but won his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) affections to such a degree, that Jack
would come running to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) whistle like a dog.

<p/>One day, having taken shelter from a shower on the stone settle outside
a certain public-house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heard a toper inside, a stranger, boasting he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
could take more at a draught than any man in Gouda. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) instantly marched
in and said, <div class="bookquote">``What, lads, do none of ye take him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) up for the honour of
Gouda? Shall it be said that there came hither one from another parish a
greater sot than any of us? Nay, then, I your parson do take him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) up.
Go to, I'll find thee a parishioner shall drink more at a draught than
thou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>A bet was made; Gerard whistled; in clattered Jack--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was taught
to come into a room with the utmost composure--and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) nose into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
backer's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pair of buckets!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>shouted Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``and let us see which of these two
sons of asses can drink most at a draught.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>On another occasion two farmers had a dispute whose hay was the best.
Failing to convince each other, they said, <div class="bookquote">``We'll ask parson;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for by
this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was their referee in every mortal thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How lucky you thought of me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``Why, I have got one staying
with me who is the best judge of hay in Holland. Bring me a double
handful apiece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>So when they came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had them into the parlour, and put each bundle on
a chair. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) whistled, and in walked Jack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord a mercy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmers</b></font>)</div>said one of the farmers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson, in the tone of conversation, <div class="bookquote">``just tell us
which is the best hay of these two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div><p/>Jack sniffed them both, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) choice directly, proving his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
sincerity by eating every morsel. The farmers slapped their thighs, and
scratched their heads. <div class="bookquote">``To think of we not thinking o' that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>And they
each sent Jack a truss.

<p/>So Gerard got to be called the merry parson of Gouda. But Margaret, who
like most loving women had no more sense of humour than a turtle-dove,
took this very ill. <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to herself, <div class="bookquote">``is there nothing sore
at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) can go about playing the zany?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
could understand pious resignation and content, but not mirth, in true
lovers parted. And whilst her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) woman's nature was perturbed by this
gust -LRB-and women seem more subject to gusts than men-RRB- came that terrible
animal, a busybody, to work upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Catherine saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not happy,
and said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Your boy is gone from you. I would not live alone all
my days if I were you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is more alone than I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>sighed Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a man is a man, but a woman is a woman. You must not think all of
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and none of yourself. Near is your kirtle, but nearer is your smock.
Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a priest, and can do no better. But you are not a priest.
He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) has got his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) parish, and his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) heart is in that. Bethink thee! Time
flies; overstay not thy market. Wouldst not like to have three or four
more little darlings about thy knee now they have robbed thee of poor
little Gerard, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to yon nasty school?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) worked upon
a mind already irritated.

<p/>Margaret had many suitors ready to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) at a word or even a
look, and among them two merchants of the better class, Van Schelt and
Oostwagen. <div class="bookquote">``Take one of those two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I will ask Gerard if I may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret one day, with a flood
of tears; <div class="bookquote">``for I cannot go on the way I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you would never be so simple as ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think you I would be so wicked as marry without his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) leave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Accordingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) actually went to Gouda, and after hanging her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head, and
blushing, and crying, and saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was miserable, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) mother
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to marry one of those two; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) approved of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) marrying
at all, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) use his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) wisdom, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) thought would be
the kindest to the little Gerard of those two; for herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not
care what became of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>Gerard felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had put a soft hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) body and torn his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
heart out with it. But the priest with a mighty effort mastered the man.
In a voice scarcely audible he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declined this responsibility. <div class="bookquote">``I am not a
saint or a prophet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I might advise thee ill. I shall read the
marriage service for thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>faltered he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it is my right. No other would
pray for thee as I should. But thou must choose for thyself; and oh! let
me see thee happy. This four months past thou hast not been happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A discontented mind is never happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, and prayed for help from above.

<p/>Margaret went home pale and agitated. <div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``never mention
it to me again, or we shall quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) forbade you? Well, more shame for him (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>), that is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) forbid me? He (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) did not condescend so far. He (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) was as noble as I
was paltry. He (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) would not choose for me for fear of choosing me an ill
husband. But he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) would read the service for my groom and me; that was his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>)
right. Oh, mother, what a heartless creature I was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I thought not he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) had that much sense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you go by the poor soul's words, but I rate words as air when
the face speaketh to mine eye. I saw the priest and the true lover
a-fighting in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) dear face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) cheek pale with the strife, and oh!
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) poor lip trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said the stout-hearted words--Oh! oh! oh!
oh! oh! oh! oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>And Margaret burst into a violent passion of tears.

<p/>Catherine groaned. <div class="bookquote">``There, give it up without more ado,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You
two are chained together for life; and if God is merciful, that won't be
for long; for what are you neither maid, wife, nor widow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``that was done long ago. All I think of now
is comforting him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); for now I have been and made him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) unhappy too, wretch
and monster that I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>So the next day they both went to Gouda. And Gerard, who had been
praying for resignation all this time, received her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with peculiar
tenderness as a treasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was to lose; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was agitated and eager
to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) see without words that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would never marry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fawned
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) like a little dog to be forgiven. And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was going away she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
murmured, <div class="bookquote">``Forgive! and forget! I am but a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) misunderstood her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``All I bargain for is, let me see thee
content; for pity's sake, let me not see thee unhappy as I have this
while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling, you never shall again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, with streaming eyes,
and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) misunderstood this too at first; but when month after month
passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard no more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) marriage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came to Gouda
comparatively cheerful, and was even civil to Father Ambrose, a mild
benevolent monk from the Dominican convent hard by--then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) understood
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); and one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to walk alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) in the sacred
paddock; and before I relate what passed between them, I must give its
history.

<p/>When Gerard had been four or five days at the manse, looking out of
window he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) uttered an exclamation of joy. <div class="bookquote">``Mother, Margaret, here is one
of my birds: another, another: four, six, nine. A miracle! a miracle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, how can you tell your birds from their fellows?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know every feather in their wings. And see; there is the little
darling whose claw I gilt, bless it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And presently his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rapture took a serious turn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) saw Heaven's
approbation in this conduct of the birds as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did in the fall of the
cave. This wonderfully kept alive his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friendship for animals; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
enclosed a paddock, and drove all the sons of Cain from it with threats
of excommunication, <div class="bookquote">``On this little spot of earth we'll have no murder,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cain</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) tamed leverets and partridges, and little birds, and hares,
and roe-deer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) found a squirrel with a broken leg; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) set it with
infinite difficulty and patience; and during the cure showed it
repositories of acorns, nuts, chestnuts, etc.. And this squirrel got well
and went off, but visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) in hard weather, and brought a mate, and
next year little squirrels were found to have imbibed their parents'
sentiments, and of all these animals each generation was tamer than the
last. This set the good parson thinking, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) the true clue to
the great successes of mediaeval hermits in taming wild animals.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) kept the key of this paddock, and never let any man but himself
enter it; nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) even let little Gerard go there without him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) or
Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Children are all little Cains,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). In this oasis, then,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) spoke to Margaret, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Dear Margaret, I have thought more than
ever of thee of late, and have asked myself why I am content, and thou
unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because thou art better, wiser, holier than I; that is all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said
Margaret promptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our lives tell another tale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``I know thy
goodness and thy wisdom too well to reason thus perversely. Also I know
that I love thee as dear as thou, I think, lovest me. Yet am I happier
than thou. Why is this so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Gerard, I am as happy as a woman can hope to be this side of the
grave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so happy as I. Now for the reason. First, then, I am a priest, and
this, the one great trial and disappointment God giveth me along with so
many joys, why, I share it with a multitude. For alas! I am not the only
priest by thousands that must never hope for entire earthly happiness.
Here, then, thy lot is harder than mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Gerard, I have my child to love. Thou canst not fill thy heart with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mother can, So you may set this against you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And I have ta’en him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) from thee; it was cruel; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) would have broken
thy heart one day if I had not. Well then, sweet one, I come to where
the shoe pincheth, methinks. I have my parish, and it keeps my heart
in a glow from morn till night. There is scarce an emotion that my folk
stir not up in me many times a day. Often their sorrows make me weep,
sometimes their perversity kindles a little wrath, and their absurdity
makes me laugh, and sometimes their flashes of unexpected goodness do
set me all of a glow, and I could hug `em. Meantime thou, poor soul,
sittest with heart--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of lead, Gerard; of very lead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See now how unkind thy lot compared with mine, Now how if thou couldst
be persuaded to warm thyself at the fire that warmeth me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, if I could?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hast but to will it. Come among my folk. Take in thine hand the alms I
set aside, and give it with kind words; hear their sorrows: they shall
show you life is full of troubles, and as thou sayest truly, no man or
woman without their thorn this side the grave. Indoors I have a map of
Gouda parish. Not to o’erburden thee at first, I will put twenty housen
under thee with their folk. What sayest thou? but for thy wisdom I had
died a dirty maniac,' and ne’er seen Gouda manse, nor pious peace. Wilt
profit in turn by what little wisdom I have to soften her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lot to whom I
do owe all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret assented warmly, and a happy thing it was for the little
district assigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); it was as if an angel had descended on them.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fingers were never tired of knitting or cutting for them, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
heart of sympathizing with them. And that heart expanded and waved its
drooping wings; and the glow of good and gentle deed began to spread
over it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was rewarded in another way by being brought into more
contact with Gerard, and also with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) spirit. All this time malicious
tongues had not been idle. <div class="bookquote">``If there is nought between them more than
meets the eye, why doth she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>etc.. And I am sorry to say our
old friend Joan Ketel was one of these coarse sceptics. And now one
winter evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Ketel</b></font>) got on a hot scent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ketel</b></font>) saw Margaret and Gerard
talking earnestly together on the Boulevard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) whipped behind a tree.
<div class="bookquote">``Now I'll hear something,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did. It was winter;
there had been one of those tremendous floods followed by a sharp
frost, and Gerard in despair as to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should lodge forty or fifty
houseless folk out of the piercing cold. And now it was, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, dear
Margaret, what shall I do? The manse is full of them, and a sharp frost
coming on this night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret reflected, and Joan listened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must lodge them in the church,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the church? Profanation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; charity profanes nothing, not even a church; soils nought, not even
a church. To-day is but Tuesday. Go save their lives, for a bitter night
is coming. Take thy stove into the church, and there house them. We will
dispose of them here and there ere the lord's day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I could not think of that; bless thee, sweet Margaret, thy mind is
stronger than mine, and readier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, a woman looks but a little way, therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sees clear.
I'll come over myself to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And on this they parted with mutual blessings.

<p/>Joan glided home remorseful.

<p/>And after that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) used to check all surmises to their discredit.
<div class="bookquote">``Beware,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``lest some angel should blister thy tongue.
Gerard and Margaret paramours? I tell ye they are two saints which meet
in secret to plot charity to the poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In the summer of 1481 Gerard determined to provide against similar
disasters recurring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) poor. Accordingly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) made a great hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
income, and bled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friends -LRB-zealous parsons always do that-RRB- to build a
large Xenodochium to receive the victims of flood or fire. Giles and all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) friends were kind, but all was not enough; when lo! the Dominican
monks of Gouda to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Dominican</b></font>) parlour and heart had been open for years,
came out nobly, and put down a handsome sum to aid the charitable vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dear good souls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``who would have thought it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any one who knows them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, <div class="bookquote">``Who more charitable than monks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to! They do but give the laity back a pig of their own sow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what more do I? What more doth the duke?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the ambitious vicar must build almshouses for decayed true men in
their old age close to the manse, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) might keep and feed them, as
well as lodge them. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) money being gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) asked Margaret for a
few thousand bricks and just took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) coat and turned builder; and
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had a good head, and the strength of a Hercules, with the zeal of
an artist, up rose a couple of almshouses parson built.

<p/>And at this work Margaret would sometimes bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) dinner, and
add a good bottle of Rhenish. And once seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) run up a plank with a
wheelbarrow full of bricks which really most bricklayers would have
gone staggering under, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Times are changed since I had to carry
little Gerard for thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, dear one, thanks to thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>When the first home was finished, the question was who they should put
into it; and being fastidious over it like a new toy, there was much
hesitation. But an old friend arrived in time to settle this question.

<p/>As Gerard was passing a public-house in Rotterdam one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard a
well-known voice, He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked up, and there was Denys of Burgundy, but
sadly changed; his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) beard stained with grey, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) clothes worn and
ragged; he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) had a cuirass still, and gauntlets, but a staff instead of an
arbalest, To the company he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) appeared to be bragging and boasting, but in
reality he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was giving a true relation of Edward the Fourth's invasion of
an armed kingdom with 2000 men, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) march through the country with
armies capable of swallowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looking on, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) battles at Tewkesbury
and Barnet, and reoccupation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) capital and kingdom in three months
after landing at the Humber with a mixed handful of Dutch, English, and
Burgundians.

<p/>In this, the greatest feat of arms the century had seen, Denys had
shone; and whilst sneering at the warlike pretensions of Charles the
Bold, a duke with an itch but no talent for fighting, and proclaiming
the English king the first captain of the age, did not forget to exalt
himself.

<p/>Gerard listened with eyes glittering affection and fun. <div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said
Denys, <div class="bookquote">``after all these feats, patted on the back by the gallant young
Prince of Gloucester, and smiled on by the great captain himself, here
I am lamed for life; by what? by the kick of a horse, and this night I
know not where I shall lay my tired bones. I had a comrade once in these
parts that would not have let me lie far from him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) turned priest
and deserted his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) sweetheart, so `tis not likely he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) would remember his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>)
comrade. And ten years play sad havoc with our hearts, and limbs, and
all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>Poor Denys sighed, and Gerard's bowels yearned over him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What words are these?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) said, with a great gulp in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">``Who
grudges a brave soldier supper and bed? Come home with me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much obliged, but I am no lover of priests.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I of soldiers; but what is supper and bed between two true men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much to you, but something to me. I will come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In one hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, and went in high spirits to Margaret, and
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) the treat in store, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must come and share it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must
drive his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) mother in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) little carriage up to the manse with all speed,
and make ready an excellent supper. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) himself borrowed a cart, and
drove Denys up rather slowly, to give the women time.

<p/>On the road Denys found out this priest was a kind soul, so told him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
trouble, and confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) heart was pretty near broken. <div class="bookquote">``The great use
our stout hearts, and arms, and lives till we are worn out, and then
fling us away like broken tools.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) sighed deeply, and it cost Gerard
a great struggle not to hug him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) then and there, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
wanted to do it all like a story book. Who has not had this fancy once
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) life? Why Joseph had it; all the better for us.

<p/>They landed at the little house. It was as clean as a penny, the hearth
blazing, and supper set.

<p/>Denys brightened up. <div class="bookquote">``Is this your house, reverend sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `tis my work, and with these hands, but `tis your house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, no such luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>said Denys, with a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I say ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>shouted Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``And what is more I--''  (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>-LRB-gulp-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``say--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div>-LRB-gulp-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``COURAGE, CAMARADE, LE DIABLE EST MORT!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Denys/St. Denys</b></font>)</div><p/>Denys started, and almost staggered. <div class="bookquote">``Why, what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) stammered,
<div class="bookquote">``w-wh-who art thou, that bringest me back the merry words and merry days
of my youth?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was greatly agitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor Denys, I am one whose face is changed, but nought else; to my
heart, dear, trusty comrade, to my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) arms, with
the tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) eyes. But Denys came close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>), and peered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>)
face, and devoured every feature; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was sure it was really
Gerard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) uttered a cry so vehement it brought the women running from
the house, and fell upon Gerard's neck, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) again and again,
and sank on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees, and laughed and sobbed with joy so terribly,
that Gerard mourned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) folly in doing dramas. But the women with their
gentle soothing ways soon composed the brave fellow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sat smiling,
and holding Margaret's hand and Gerard's, And they all supped together,
and went to their beds with hearts warm as a toast; and the broken
soldier was at peace, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) own house, and under his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) comrade's
wing.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) natural gaiety returned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) consigne after eight
years' disuse, and hobbled about the place enlivening it; but offended
the parish mortally by calling the adored vicar comrade, and nothing but
comrade.

<p/>When they made a fuss about this to Gerard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) just looked in their
faces and said, <div class="bookquote">``What does it matter? Break him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) of swearing, and you
shall have my thanks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This year Margaret went to a lawyer to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) will, for without this,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was told, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy might have trouble some day to get his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own, not
being born in lawful wedlock. The lawyer, however, in conversation,
expressed a different opinion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the babble of churchmen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Yours is a perfect
marriage, though an irregular one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) then informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) that throughout Europe, excepting only the southern
part of Britain, there were three irregular marriages, the highest of
which was hers, viz., a betrothal before witnesses, <div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>witnesses</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if
not followed by matrimonial intercourse, is a marriage complete in form,
but incomplete in substance. A person so betrothed can forbid any other
banns to all eternity. It has, however, been set aside where a party
so betrothed contrived to get married regularly, and children were born
thereafter. But such a decision was for the sake of the offspring,
and of doubtful justice. However, in your case the birth of your
child closes that door, and your marriage is complete both in form and
substance. Your course, therefore, is to sue for your conjugal rights;
it will be the prettiest case of the century. The law is all on our
side, the Church all on theirs. If you come to that, the old Batavian
law, which compelled the clergy to marry, hath fallen into disuse, but
was never formally repealed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret was quite puzzled. <div class="bookquote">``What are you driving at, sir? Who am I to
go to law with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is the defendant? Why, the vicar of Gouda.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, poor soul! And for what shall I law him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) take you into his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) house, and share bed and board with
you, to be sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret turned red as fire, <div class="bookquote">``Gramercy for your rede,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``What,
is yon a woman's part? Constrain a man to be hers by force? That is
men's way of wooing, not ours. Say I were so ill a woman as ye think me,
I should set myself to beguile him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), not to law him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) departed,
crimson with shame and indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is an impracticable fool for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man of art.

<p/>Margaret had her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) will drawn elsewhere, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) boy safe from
poverty, marriage or no marriage.

<p/>These are the principal incidents that in ten whole years befell two
peaceful lives, which in a much shorter period had been so thronged with
adventures and emotions.

<p/>Their general tenor was now peace, piety, the mild content that lasts,
not the fierce bliss ever on tiptoe to depart, and above all, Christian
charity.

<p/>On this sacred ground these two true lovers met with an uniformity and
a kindness of sentiment which went far to soothe the wound in their own
hearts, To pity the same bereaved; to hunt in couples all the ills
in Gouda, and contrive and scheme together to remedy all that were
remediable; to use the rare insight into troubled hearts which their
own troubles had given them, and use it to make others happier than
themselves--this was their daily practice. And in this blessed cause
their passions for one another cooled a little, but their affection
increased.

<p/>From this time Margaret entered heart and soul into Gerard's pious
charities, that affection purged itself of all mortal dross. And as
it had now long out-lived scandal and misapprehension, one would have
thought that so bright an example of pure self-denying affection was to
remain long before the world, to show men how nearly religious faith,
even when not quite reasonable, and religious charity, which is always
reasonable, could raise two true lovers' hearts to the loving hearts
of the angels of heaven. But the great Disposer of events ordered
otherwise.

<p/>Little Gerard rejoiced both his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) parents' hearts by the extraordinary
progress he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) made at Alexander Haaghe's famous school at Deventer.

<p/>The last time Margaret returned from visiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came to Gerard
flushed with pride. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gerard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) will be a great man one day, thanks
to thy wisdom in taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) from us silly women. A great scholar, one
Zinthius, came to see the school and judge the scholars, and didn't our
Gerard stand up, and not a line in Horace or Terence could Zinthius cite
but the boy would follow him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with the rest. `Why, `tis a prodigy,' says
that great scholar; and there was his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) poor mother stood by and heard it.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) took our Gerard in his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) arms, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>); and what think you
he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I know not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Holland will hear of thee one day; and not Holland only, but all the
world,' Why what a sad brow!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sweet one, I am as glad as thou, yet am I uneasy to hear the child is
wise before his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) time, I love him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) dear; but he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) is thine idol, and Heaven
doth often break our idols.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make thy mind easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Heaven will never rob me of my
child. What I was to suffer in this world I have suffered, For if any
ill happened my child or thee, I should not live a week. The Lord He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
knows this, and He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will leave me my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A month had elapsed after this; but Margaret's words were yet ringing in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ears, when, going on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) daily round of visits to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) poor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was
told quite incidentally, and as mere gossip, that the plague was at
Deventer, carried thither by two sailors from Hamburgh.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heart turned cold within him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). News did not gallop in those days. The
fatal disease must have been there a long time before the tidings would
reach Gouda. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sent a line by a messenger to Margaret, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was gone to fetch little Gerard to stay at the manse a little while,
and would she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) see a bed prepared, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should be back next day. And so
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would not hear a word of the danger till it was all happily
over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) borrowed a good horse, and scarce drew rein till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reached
Deventer, quite late in the afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went at once to the school.
The boy had been taken away.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left the school he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) caught sight of Margaret's face at the window
of a neighbouring house she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) always lodged at when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came to Deventer.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ran hastily to scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and pack both her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and the boy out of the
place.

<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) surprise the servant told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with some hesitation that Margaret
had been there, but was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone, woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard indignantly, <div class="bookquote">``art not ashamed to say so? Why,
I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) but now at the window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A sweet voice above said, <div class="bookquote">``Stay him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) not, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) enter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>It was
Margaret.

<p/>Gerard ran up the stairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and went to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand, She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) drew
back hastily.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) looked astounded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am displeased,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said coldly. <div class="bookquote">``What makes you here? Know you not
the plague is in the town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, dear Margaret; and came straightway to take our boy away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, had he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) no mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How you speak to me! I hoped you knew not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, think you I leave my boy unwatched? I pay a trusty woman that
notes every change in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cheek when I am not here, and lets me know, I
am his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Rotterdam, I hope, ere this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank Heaven! And why are you not there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not fit for the journey; never heed me; go you home on the
instant; I'll follow. For shame of you to come here risking your
precious life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not so precious as thine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``But let that pass; we
will go home together, and on the instant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I have some matters to do in the town. Go thou at once, and I will
follow forthwith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave thee alone in a plague-stricken town? To whom speak you, dear
Margaret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, then, we shall quarrel, Gerard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Methinks I see Margaret and Gerard quarrelling! Why, it takes two to
quarrel, and we are but one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>With this Gerard smiled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sweetly. But there was no kind responsive
glance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) looked cold, gloomy, and troubled.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sighed, and sat patiently down opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face all puzzled
and saddened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) said nothing, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would explain her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
capricious conduct, or it would explain itself.

<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) rose hastily, and tried to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bedroom, but on the
way she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) staggered and put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with a cry of
alarm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) swooned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gently on the ground, and
beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cold hands, and ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bedroom, and fetched water, and
sprinkled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pale face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own was scarce less pale, for in a basin he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
had seen water stained with blood; it alarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knew not why.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was a long time ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) revived, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found Gerard
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand, and bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with a look of infinite concern
and tenderness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) seemed at first as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) responded to it, but the
next moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes dilated, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried--<div class="bookquote">``Ah, wretch, leave my hand;
how dare you touch me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven help her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is not herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not leave me, then, Gerard?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) faintly. <div class="bookquote">``Alas! why do I
ask? Would I leave thee if thou wert--At least touch me not, and then I
will let thee bide, and see the last of poor Margaret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ne’er spoke
harsh to thee before, sweetheart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) never will again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! what mean these dark words, these wild and troubled looks?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said
Gerard, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor Gerard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``forgive me that I spoke so to thee. I
am but a woman, and would have spared thee a sight will make thee weep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) burst into tears. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried, weeping, <div class="bookquote">``that I cannot keep
grief from thee; there is a great sorrow before my darling, and this
time I shall not be able to come and dry his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it come, Margaret, so it touch not thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div>said Margaret solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``call now religion to thine aid and
mine. I must have died before thee one day, or else outlived thee and so
died of grief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Van Eyck/Van Eyck</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Died? thou die? I will never let thee die. Where is thy pain? What is
thy trouble?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The plague,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said calmly. Gerard uttered a cry of horror, and
started to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) feet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) read his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Useless,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``My nose hath bled; none ever yet survived to whom that came along with
the plague. Bring no fools hither to babble over the body they cannot
save. I am but a woman; I love not to be stared at; let none see me die
but thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>And even with this a convulsion seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remained sensible
but speechless a long time.

<p/>And now for the first time Gerard began to realize the frightful truth,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) ran wildly to and fro, and cried to Heaven for help, as drowning
men cry to their fellow-creatures. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) raised herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arm, and
set herself to quiet him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had known the torture of hopes and fears, and was
resolved to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) that agony. <div class="bookquote">``I let my mind dwell too much on the
danger,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and so opened my brain to it, through which door
when this subtle venom enters it makes short work. I shall not be
spotted or loathsome, my poor darling; God is good, and spares thee
that; but in twelve hours I shall be a dead woman. Ah, look not so, but
be a man; be a priest! Waste not one precious minute over my body! it is
doomed; but comfort my parting soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gerard, sick and cold at heart, kneeled down, and prayed for help from
Heaven to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) duty.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) knees his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) face was pale and old, but deadly calm
and patient. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went softly and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) bed into the room, and laid
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gently down and supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head with pillows. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) prayed by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) side the prayers for the dying, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said Amen to each prayer.
Then for some hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wandered, but when the fell disease had quite
made sure of its prey, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind cleared, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) begged Gerard to shrive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``For oh, my conscience it is laden,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confess thy sins to me, my daughter: let there be no reserve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sadly, <div class="bookquote">``I have one great sin on my breast this
many years. E’en now that death is at my heart I can scarce own it. But
the Lord is debonair; if thou wilt pray to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), perchance He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) may forgive
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confess it first, my daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--alas!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confess it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I deceived thee. This many years I have deceived thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here tears interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, my daughter, courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard kindly, overpowering the
lover in the priest.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands, and with many sighs told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
who had broken down the hermit's cave with the help of Jorian Ketel, <div class="bookquote">``I,
shallow, did it but to hinder thy return thither; but when thou sawest
therein the finger of God, I played the traitress, and said, `While he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
thinks so, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will ne’er leave Gouda manse;' and I held my tongue. Oh,
false heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jorian/Jorian Ketel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, my daughter; thou dost exaggerate a trivial fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but `tis not all, The birds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``They followed thee not to Gouda by miracle, but by my treason. I said,
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will ne’er be quite happy without his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) birds that visited him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
cell; and I was jealous of them, and cried, and said, these foul little
things, they are my child's rivals. And I bought loaves of bread, and
Jorian and me we put crumbs at the cave door, and thence went sprinkling
them all the way to the manse, and there a heap. And my wiles succeeded,
and they came, and thou wast glad, and I was pleased to see thee
glad; and when thou sawest in my guile the finger of Heaven, wicked,
deceitful, I did hold my tongue. But die deceiving thee? ah, no, I could
not. Forgive me if thou canst; I was but a woman; I knew no better at
the time. `Twas writ in my bosom with a very sunbeam. `'Tis good for him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
to bide at Gouda manse.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive thee, sweet innocent?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>sobbed Gerard; <div class="bookquote">``what have I to forgive?
Thou hadst a foolish froward child to guide to his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) own weal, and
didst all this for the best, I thank thee and bless thee. But as thy
confessor, all deceit is ill in Heaven's pure eyes. Therefore thou
hast done well to confess and report it; and even on thy confession
and penitence the Church through me absolves thee. Pass to thy graver
faults.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My graver faults? Alas! alas! Why, what have I done to compare? I am
not an ill woman, not a very ill one. If He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) can forgive me deceiving
thee, He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) can well forgive me all the rest ever I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Being gently pressed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was to blame not to have done more
good in the world. <div class="bookquote">``I have just begun to do a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and
now I must go. But I repine not, since `tis Heaven's will, only I am so
afeard thou wilt miss me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And at this she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tears,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tried hard.

<p/>Gerard struggled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) could; and knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) life of
piety, purity, and charity, and seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
present state realise any sin but her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) having deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
full absolution, Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) put the crucifix in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
consecrated the oil, bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fix her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind neither on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) merits nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
demerits, but on Him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) who died for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) on the tree.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with a look of confiding love and submission.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes with the consecrated oil, and prayed aloud
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>Soon after she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dosed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) watched beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), more dead than alive himself.

<p/>When the day broke she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) awoke, and seemed to acquire some energy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) box for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) marriage lines and for a picture,
and bring them both to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) then entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) by all
they had suffered for each other, to ease her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind by making a solemn
vow to execute her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dying requests.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) vowed to obey them to the letter.

<p/>``Then, Gerard, let no creature come here to lay me out. I could not bear
to be stared at; my very corpse would blush. Also I would not be made
a monster of for the worms to sneer at as well as feed on. Also my very
clothes are tainted, and shall to earth with me. I am a physician's
daughter; and ill becomes me kill folk, being dead, which did so little
good to men in the days of health; wherefore lap me in lead, the way I
am, and bury me deep! yet not so deep but what one day thou mayst find
the way, and lay thy bones by mine.

<p/>``Whiles I lived I went to Gouda but once or twice a week. It cost me not
to go each day. Let me gain this by dying, to be always at dear Gouda,
in the green kirkyard.

<p/>``Also they do say the spirit hovers where the body lies; I would have my
spirit hover near thee, and the kirkyard is not far from the manse. I am
so afeard some ill will happen thee, Margaret being gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And see, with mine own hands I place my marriage lines in my bosom. Let
no living hand move them, on pain of thy curse and mine. Then when the
angel comes for me at the last day, he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) shall say, this is an honest
woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hath her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marriage lines -LRB-for you know I am your lawful wife,
though Holy Church hath come between us-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) will set me where the
honest women be. I will not sit among ill women, no, not in heaven
for their mind is not my mind, nor their soul my soul. I have stood,
unbeknown, at my window, and heard their talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was unable to say any more, but made signs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had not done.

<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) breath, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) look at the picture.

<p/>It was the portrait he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) when they were young together,
and little thought to part so soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) held it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hands and looked
at it, but could scarce see it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had left it in fragments, but now it
was whole.

<p/>``They cut it to pieces, Gerard; but see, Love mocked at their knives.

<p/>``I implore thee with my dying breath, let this picture hang ever in
thine eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard that such as die of the plague, unspotted, yet after death
spots have been known to come out; and oh, I could not bear thy last
memory of me to be so. Therefore, as soon as the breath is out of my

we meet again, `twill not be so very long. O promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div>said Gerard, sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But look on this picture instead. Forgive me; I am but a woman. I could
not bear my face to lie a foul thing in thy memory. Nay, I must have
thee still think me as fair as I was true. Hast called me an angel once

only a poor simple woman, that whiles saw clearer than thou because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
looked but a little way, and that loves thee dearly, and never loved but
thee, and now with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dying breath prays thee indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in this, thou
that art a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, I will. Each word, each wish, is sacred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless thee! Bless thee! So then the eyes that now can scarce see thee,
they are so troubled by the pest, and the lips that shall not touch thee
to taint thee, will still be before thee as they were when we were young
and thou didst love me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I did love thee, Margaret! Oh, never loved I thee as now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hast not told me so of late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! hath love no voice but words? I was a priest; I had charge of
thy soul; the sweet offices of a pure love were lawful; words of love
imprudent at the least. But now the good fight is won, ah me! Oh my
love, if thou hast lived doubting of thy Gerard's heart, die not so; for
never was woman loved so tenderly as thou this ten years past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Calm thyself, dear one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the dying woman, with a heavenly smile.
<div class="bookquote">``I know it; only being but a woman, I could not die happy till I had
heard thee say so. Ah! I have pined ten years for those sweet words.
Hast said them, and this is the happiest hour of my life. I had to die
to get them; well, I grudge not the price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>From this moment a gentle complacency rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fading features. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not speak.

<p/>Then Gerard, who had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul so many years, feared lest she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
should expire with a mind too fixed on earthly affection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh my daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cried, ``my dear daughter, if indeed thou lovest me
as I love thee, give me not the pain of seeing thee die with thy pious
soul fixed on mortal things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest lamb of all my fold, for whose soul I must answer, oh think not
now of mortal love, but of His (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) who died for thee on the tree. Oh, let
thy last look be heavenwards, thy last word a word of prayer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned a look of gratitude and obedience on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What saint?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured: meaning doubtless, <div class="bookquote">``what saint should she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) invoke as an
intercessor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) to whom the saints themselves do pray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) one more sweet look of love and submission, and put
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pretty hands together in a prayer like a child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jesu!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This blessed word was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) last. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes heavenwards, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands put together.

<p/>Gerard prayed fervently for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passing spirit. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had prayed a
long time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head averted, not to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) last breath, all seemed
unnaturally still. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head fearfully. It was so.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was gone.

<p/>Nothing left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) now but the earthly shell of as constant, pure, and
loving a spirit as eve' adorned the earth.

<p/>-LRB-1-RRB- Let me not be understood to apply this to the bare
outline of the relation. Many bishops and priests, and not a
few popes, had wives and children as laymen; and entering
orders were parted from the wives and not from the children.
But in the case before the reader are the additional
features of a strong surviving attachment on both sides, and
of neighbourhood, besides that here the man had been led
into holy orders by a false statement of the woman's death.
On a summary of all the essential features, the situation
was, to the best of my belief, unique.


<p/>CHAPTER XCVII

<p/>A priest is never more thoroughly a priest than in the chamber of death,
Gerard did the last offices of the Church for the departed, just as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) should have done them for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) smallest parishioner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) did this
mechanically, then sat down stupefied by the sudden and tremendous blow,
and not yet realizing the pangs of bereavement. Then in a transport of
religious enthusiasm he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) kneeled and thanked Heaven for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) Christian
end.

<p/>And then all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought was to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) away from strangers, and lay
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own churchyard. That very evening a covered cart with one
horse started for Gouda, and in it was a coffin, and a broken-hearted
man lying with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms and chin resting on it.

<p/>The mourner's short-lived energy had exhausted itself in the necessary
preparations, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay crushed, clinging to the cold lead that
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>The man of whom the cart was hired walked by the horse's head and did
not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) baited the horse spoke but in a whisper
respecting that mute agony. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped for the night, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and
the landlord made a well-meaning attempt to get the mourner away to take
some rest and food. But Gerard repulsed them, and when they persisted,
almost snarled at them, like a faithful dog, and clung to the cold lead
all night. So then they drew a cloak over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in peace.

<p/>And at noon the sorrowful cart came up to the manse, and there were
full a score of parishioners collected with one little paltry trouble or
another. They had missed the parson already. And when they saw what it
was, and saw their healer so stricken down, they raised a loud wail of
grief, and it roused him (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) lethargy of woe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) saw where he (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>)
was, and their faces, and tried to speak to them, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my children! my
children!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) cried; but choked with anguish, could say no more.

<p/>Yet the next day, spite of all remonstrances, he (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) buried her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) himself,
and read the service with a voice that only trembled now and then, Many
tears fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) grave. And when the service ended he (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) stayed there
standing like a statue, and the people left the churchyard out of
respect.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>healer</b></font>) stood like one in a dream till the sexton, who was, as most men are,
a fool, began to fill in the grave without giving him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) due warning.

<p/>But at the sound of earth falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Gerard uttered a piercing
scream.

<p/>The sexton forbore.

<p/>Gerard staggered and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) breast. The sexton supported
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and called for help.

<p/>Jorian Ketel, who lingered near mourning his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) benefactress, ran into the
churchyard, and the two supported Gerard into the manse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Jorian! good Jorian!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``something snapped within me; I
felt it, and I heard it; here, Jorian, here;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
breast.



<p/>CHAPTER XCVIII

<p/>A fortnight after this a pale bowed figure entered the Dominican convent
in the suburbs of Gouda, and sought speech with Brother Ambrose, who
governed the convent as deputy, the prior having lately died, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>)
successor, though appointed, not having arrived.

<p/>The sick man was Gerard, come to end life as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) began it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) entered as a novice, on probation; but the truth was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was a
failing man, and knew it, and came there to die in peace, near kind and
gentle Ambrose, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) friend, and the other monks to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) house and
heart had always been open.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) manse was more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) could bear; it was too full of reminiscences
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>).

<p/>Ambrose, who knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) value, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) sorrow, was not without a kindly
hope of curing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>), and restoring him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) parish. With this view he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>)
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) in a comfortable cell over the gateway, and forbade him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) to fast
or practice any austerities.

<p/>But in a few days the new prior arrived, and proved a very Tartar.
At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) was absorbed in curing abuses, and tightening the general
discipline; but one day hearing the vicar of Gouda had entered the
convent as a novice, he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) said, ```Tis well; let him (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) first give up his (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>)
vicarage then, or go; I'll no fat parsons in my house.'' The prior then
sent for Gerard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>); and the moment they saw one another
they both started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clement!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jerome!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XCIX

<p/>Jerome was as morose as ever in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) general character, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) had
somewhat softened towards Gerard. All the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) was in England he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
had missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) more then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) thought possible, and since then had often
wondered what had become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). What he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) heard in Gouda raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
feeble brother in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) good opinion; above all, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had withstood
the Pope and the Minorites on <div class="bookquote">``the infernal heresy of the immaculate
conception,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Pope Minorites</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) called it. But when one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) young monks told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eyes the Cause of Gerard's illness, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) contempt
revived. <div class="bookquote">``Dying for a woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) determined to avert this scandal; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) visited Clement twice a day
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) cell, and tried all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) old influence and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eloquence to
induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) to shake off this unspiritual despondency, and not rob the
church of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) piety and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) eloquence at so critical a period.

<p/>Gerard heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), approved his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) reasoning, admired his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) strength,
confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) own weakness, and continued visibly to wear away to the
land of the leal. One day Jerome told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) story, and
heard it with pride. <div class="bookquote">``But now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you spoil it all, Clement; for
this is the triumph of earthly passion. Better have yielded to it and
repented, than resist it while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lived, and succumb under it now, body
and soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Jerome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div>said Clement, so sweetly as to rob his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) remonstrance of
the tone of remonstrance, <div class="bookquote">``here, I think, you do me some injustice.
Passion there is none; but a deep affection, for which I will not blush
here, since I shall not blush for it in heaven. Bethink thee, Jerome,
the poor dog that dies of grief on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) master's grave, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) guilty of
passion? Neither am I. Passion had saved my life, and lost my soul, She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was my good angel; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sustained me in my duty and charity; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face
encouraged me in the pulpit; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips soothed me under ingratitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
intertwined herself with all that was good in my life; and after leaning
on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so long, I could not go on alone. And, dear Jerome, believe me
I am no rebel against Heaven. It is God's will to release me. When they
threw the earth upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poor coffin, something snapped within my bosom
here that mended may not be. I heard it, and I felt it. And from that
time, Jerome, no food that I put in my mouth had any savour. With my
eyes bandaged now I could not tell thee which was bread, and which was
flesh, by eating of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clement/Brother Clement</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Holy saints!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And again, from that same hour my deep dejection left me, and I smiled
again. I often smile--why? I read it thus: He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) in whose hands are the
issues of life and death gave me that minute the great summons; `twas
some cord of life snapped in me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) is very pitiful. I should have lived
unhappy; but He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) said, `No; enough is done, enough is suffered; poor
feeble, loving servant, thy shortcomings are forgiven, thy sorrows touch
thine end; come thou to thy rest!' I come, Lord, I come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div><p/>Jerome groaned. <div class="bookquote">``The Church had ever her (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) holy but feeble servants,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``Now would I give ten years of my life to save thine. But I see it
may not be. Die in peace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>And so it was that in a few days more Gerard lay a-dying in a frame
of mind so holy and happy, that more than one aged saint was there to
garner his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) dying words. In the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) had seen Giles, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>)
not to let poor Jack starve; and to see that little Gerard's trustees
did their duty, and to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) parents for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and to send Denys
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) friends in Burgundy: <div class="bookquote">``Poor thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will feel so strange here
without his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) comrade.''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>And after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) had an interview with Jerome
alone. What passed between them was never distinctly known; but it must
have been something remarkable, for Jerome went from the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>)
hands crossed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) breast, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) high head lowered, and sighing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>)
went.

<p/>The two monks that watched with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) till matins related that all through
the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) broke out from time to time in pious ejaculations, and
praises, and thanksgivings; only once they said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) wandered, and thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>) walking in green meadows with other spirits clad in white,
and beckoning him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>); and they all smiled and beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerome</b></font>). And both these
monks said -LRB-but it might have been fancy-RRB- that just before dawn there
came three light taps against the wall, one after another, very slow;
and the dying man heard them, and said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I come, love, I come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gerard/Ser Gerard/Ser</b></font>)</div><p/>This much is certain, that Gerard did utter these words, and prepare
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) departure, having uttered them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) sent for all the monks who at
that hour were keeping vigil. They came, and hovered like gentle spirits
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with holy words. Some prayed in silence for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) with their
faces touching the ground, others tenderly supported his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) head. But when
one of them said something about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) life of self-denial and charity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)
stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>), and addressing them all said, ``My dear brethren, take note
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) who here dies so happy holds not these new-fangled doctrines of
man's merit. Oh, what a miserable hour were this to me an if I did!
Nay, but I hold, with the Apostles, and their pupils in the Church, the
ancient fathers, that we are justified not by our own wisdom, or piety,
or the works we have done in holiness of heart, but by faith.'''-LRB-1-RRB-

<p/>Then there was silence, and the monks looked at one another
significantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please you sweep the floor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Christian</b></font>)</div>said the dying Christian, in a voice to
which all its clearance and force seemed supernaturally restored.

<p/>They instantly obeyed, not without a sentiment of awe and curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make me a great cross with wood ashes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They strewed the ashes in form of a great Cross upon the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now lay me down on it, for so will I die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And they took him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) gently from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) bed, and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) on the cross of wood
ashes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we spread out thine arms, dear brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now God forbid! Am I worthy of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) lay silent, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) eyes raised in ecstasy.

<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) spoke half to them, half to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) said, with
a subdued but concentrated rapture, <div class="bookquote">``I feel it buoyant. It lifts me
floating in the sky whence my merits had sunk me like lead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Day broke; and displayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) face cast upward in silent rapture, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
hands together; like Margaret's.

<p/>And just about the hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) died he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) last word in this world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jesu!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And even with that word--he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) fell asleep.

<p/>They laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) out for his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) last resting-place.

<p/>Under his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) linen they found a horse-hair shirt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the monks</b></font>)</div>cried the young monks, <div class="bookquote">``behold a saint!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the monks</b></font>)</div><p/>Under the hair cloth they found a long thick tress of auburn hair.

<p/>They started, and were horrified; and a babel of voices arose, some
condemning, some excusing.

<p/>In the midst of which Jerome came in, and hearing the dispute, turned to
an ardent young monk called Basil, who was crying scandal the loudest,
<div class="bookquote">``Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Basil</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) alive or dead that owned this hair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How may I know, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then for aught you know it may be the relic of a saint?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certes it may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Basil</b></font>)</div>said Basil sceptically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have then broken our rule, which saith, `Put ill construction on no
act done by a brother which can be construed innocently.' Who are you
to judge such a man as this was? go to your cell, and stir not out for a
week by way of penance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) then carried off the lock of hair.

<p/>And when the coffin was to be closed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) cleared the cell: and put the
tress upon the dead man's bosom. <div class="bookquote">``There, Clement,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) to the dead
face. And set himself a penance for doing it; and nailed the coffin up
himself.

<p/>The next day Gerard was buried in Gouda churchyard. The monks followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) in procession from the convent. Jerome, who was evidently carrying
out the wishes of the deceased, read the service. The grave was a deep
one, and at the bottom of it was a lead coffin. Poor Gerard's, light as
a feather -LRB-so wasted was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>)-RRB-, was lowered, and placed by the side of it.

<p/>After the service Jerome said a few words to the crowd of parishioners
that had come to take the last look at their best friend. When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke
of the virtues of the departed loud wailing and weeping burst forth, and
tears fell upon the coffin like rain.

<p/>The monks went home. Jerome collected them in the refectory and spoke to
them thus: <div class="bookquote">``We have this day laid a saint in the earth. The convent will
keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) trentals, but will feast, not fast; for our good brother is
freed from the burden of the flesh; his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) labours are over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) has
entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) joyful rest. I alone shall fast, and do penance; for to
my shame I say it, I was unjust to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>), and knew not his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) worth till it
was too late. And you, young monks, be not curious to inquire whether a
lock he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) bore on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) bosom was a token of pure affection or the relic of
a saint; but remember the heart he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) wore beneath: most of all, fix your
eyes upon his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) life and conversation, and follow them an ye may: for he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>)
was a holy man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerome/St. Jerome</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus after life's fitful fever these true lovers were at peace.

<p/>The grave, kinder to them than the Church, united them for ever; and now
a man of another age and nation, touched with their fate, has laboured
to build their tombstone, and rescue them from long and unmerited
oblivion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks for them your sympathy, but not your pity.

<p/>No, put this story to a wholesome use.

<p/>Fiction must often give false views of life and death. Here as it
happens, curbed by history, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) gives you true ones. Let the barrier
that kept these true lovers apart prepare you for this, that here on
earth there will nearly always be some obstacle or other to your perfect
happiness; to their early death apply your Reason and your Faith, by
way of exercise and preparation. For if you cannot bear to be told that
these died young, who had they lived a hundred years would still be
dead, how shall you bear to see the gentle, the loving, and the true
glide from your own bosom to the grave, and fly from your house to
heaven?

<p/>Yet this is in store for you. In every age the Master of life and death,
who is kinder as well as wiser than we are, has transplanted to heaven,
young, earth's sweetest flowers.

<p/>I ask your sympathy, then, for their rare constancy and pure affection,
and their cruel separation by a vile heresy-LRB-2-RRB- in the bosom of the
Church; but not your pity for their early but happy end.

<p/>`Beati sunt qui in Domino moriuntur.

<p/>CHAPTER C

<p/>In compliance with a Custom I despise, but have not the spirit to
resist, I linger on the stage to pick up the smaller fragments of
humanity I have scattered about; i.e. some of them, for the wayside
characters have no claim on me; they have served their turn if they have
persuaded the reader that Gerard travelled from Holland to Rome through
human beings, and not through a population of dolls.

<p/>Eli and Catherine lived to a great age: lived so long, that both Gerard
and Margaret grew to be dim memories. Giles also was longaevous; he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) went
to the court of Bavaria, and was alive there at ninety, but had somehow
turned into bones and leather, trumpet toned.

<p/>Cornelis, free from all rivals, and forgiven long ago by his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) mother, who
clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) more and more now all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brood was scattered, waited and
waited and waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) parents' decease. But Catherine's shrewd word
came true; ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mate wore out, this worthy rusted away. At
sixty-five he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) lay dying of old age in his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) mother's arms, a hale woman
of eighty-six. He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) had lain unconscious a while, but came to himself
in articulo mortis, and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) near him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>), told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) would
transform the shop and premises as soon as they should be his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my
darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the poor old woman soothingly, and in another minute he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>)
was clay, and that clay was followed to the grave by all the feet whose
shoes he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) had waited for.

<p/>Denys, broken-hearted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) comrade's death, was glad to return to
Burgundy, and there a small pension the court allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) until
unexpectedly he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) inherited a considerable sum from a relation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) was
known in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) native place for many years as a crusty old soldier,
who could tell good stories of war when he (<font color='blue'><b>Denys</b></font>) chose, and a bitter railer
against women.

<p/>Jerome, disgusted with northern laxity, retired to Italy, and having
high connections became at seventy a mitred abbot. He (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) put on the screw
of discipline; his (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) monks revered and hated him (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) ruled with iron rod
ten years. And one night he (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) died, alone; for he (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) had not found the way to
a single heart. The Vulgate was on his (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) pillow, and the crucifix in his (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>)
hand, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) lips something more like a smile than was ever seen
there while he (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) lived; so that, methinks, at that awful hour he (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) was not
quite alone. Requiescat in pace. The Master he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) served has many servants,
and they have many minds, and now and then a faithful one will be a
surly one, as it is in these our mortal mansions.

<p/>The yellow-haired laddie, Gerard Gerardson, belongs not to Fiction but
to History. She (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) has recorded his (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>) birth in other terms than mine. Over
the tailor's house in the Brede Kirk Straet she (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) has inscribed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``HAEC EST PARVA DOMUS NATUS QUA MAGNUS ERASMUS,''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) has written half-a-dozen lives of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gerard</b></font>). But there is something
left for her (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) yet to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>) has no more comprehended magnum Erasmum,
than any other pigmy comprehends a giant, or partisan a judge.

<p/>First scholar and divine of his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) epoch, he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) was also the heaven-born
dramatist of his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) century. Some of the best scenes in this new book are
from his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) mediaeval pen, and illumine the pages where they come; for the
words of a genius so high as his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) are not born to die: their immediate
work upon mankind fulfilled, they may seem to lie torpid; but at each
fresh shower of intelligence Time pours upon their students, they prove
their immortal race: they revive, they spring from the dust of great
libraries; they bud, they flower, they fruit, they seed, from generation
to generation, and from age to age.
