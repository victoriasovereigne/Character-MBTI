<p/>PREFACE.


<p/>The writing of prefaces is, for the most part, work thrown away; and
the writing of a preface to a novel is almost always a vain thing.
Nevertheless, I am tempted to prefix a few words to this novel on
its completion, not expecting that many people will read them, but
desirous, in doing so, of defending myself against a charge which may
possibly be made against me by the critics,--as to which I shall be
unwilling to revert after it shall have been preferred.

<p/>I have introduced in the Vicar of Bullhampton the character of a girl
whom I will call,--for want of a truer word that shall not in its
truth be offensive,--a castaway. I have endeavoured to endow her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with
qualities that may create sympathy, and I have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back at
last from degradation at least to decency. I have not married her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to
a wealthy lover, and I have endeavoured to explain that though there
was possible to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a way out of perdition, still things could not be
with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as they would have been had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not fallen.

<p/>There arises, of course, the question whether a novelist, who
professes to write for the amusement of the young of both sexes,
should allow himself to bring upon his (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) stage such a character as that
of Carry Brattle? It is not long since,--it is well within the memory
of the author,--that the very existence of such a condition of life,
as was hers, was supposed to be unknown to our sisters and daughters,
and was, in truth, unknown to many of them. Whether that ignorance
was good may be questioned; but that it exists no longer is beyond
question. Then arises that further question,--how far the condition
of such unfortunates should be made a matter of concern to the sweet
young hearts of those whose delicacy and cleanliness of thought is a
matter of pride to so many of us. Cannot women, who are good, pity
the sufferings of the vicious, and do something perhaps to mitigate
and shorten them, without contamination from the vice? It will be
admitted probably by most men who have thought upon the subject that
no fault among us is punished so heavily as that fault, often so
light in itself but so terrible in its consequences to the less
faulty of the two offenders, by which a woman falls. All her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own sex
is against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--and all those of the other sex in whose veins runs
the blood which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is thought to have contaminated, and who, of
nature, would befriend her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) trouble any other than it is.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is, and remains in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) abject, pitiless, unutterable
misery, because this sentence of the world has placed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beyond
the helping hand of Love and Friendship. It may be said, no doubt,
that the severity of this judgment acts as a protection to female
virtue,--deterring, as all known punishments do deter, from vice. But
this punishment, which is horrible beyond the conception of those who
have not regarded it closely, is not known beforehand. Instead of the
punishment there is seen a false glitter of gaudy life,--a glitter
which is damnably false,--and which, alas, has been more often
portrayed in glowing colours, for the injury of young girls, than
have those horrors, which ought to deter, with the dark shadowings
which belong to them.

<p/>To write in fiction of one so fallen as the noblest of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) sex, as
one to be rewarded because of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) weakness, as one whose life is
happy, bright, and glorious, is certainly to allure to vice and
misery. But it may perhaps be possible that if the matter be handled
with truth to life, some girl, who would have been thoughtless, may
be made thoughtful, or some parent's heart may be softened. It may
also at last be felt that this misery is worthy of alleviation, as is
every misery to which humanity is subject.

<p/>THE VICAR OF BULLHAMPTON.



<p/>CHAPTER I.

<p/>BULLHAMPTON.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration-RSB-

<p/>I am disposed to believe that no novel reader in England has seen the
little town of Bullhampton, in Wiltshire, except such novel readers
as live there, and those others, very few in number, who visit it
perhaps four times a year for the purposes of trade, and who are
known as commercial gentlemen. Bullhampton is seventeen miles from
Salisbury, eleven from Marlborough, nine from Westbury, seven from
Haylesbury, and five from the nearest railroad station, which is
called Bullhampton Road, and lies on the line from Salisbury to
Ycovil. It is not quite on Salisbury Plain, but probably was so once,
when Salisbury Plain was wider than it is now. Whether it should be
called a small town or a large village I cannot say. It has no mayor,
and no market, but it has a fair. There rages a feud in Bullhampton
touching this want of a market, as there are certain Bullhamptonites
who aver that the charter giving all rights of a market to
Bullhampton does exist; and that at one period in its history the
market existed also,--for a year or two; but the three bakers and
two butchers are opposed to change; and the patriots of the place,
though they declaim on the matter over their evening pipes and
gin-and-water, have not enough of matutinal zeal to carry out their
purpose. Bullhampton is situated on a little river, which meanders
through the chalky ground, and has a quiet, slow, dreamy prettiness
of its own. A mile above the town,--for we will call it a town,--the
stream divides itself into many streamlets, and there is a district
called the Water Meads, in which bridges are more frequent than
trustworthy, in which there are hundreds of little sluice-gates for
regulating the irrigation, and a growth of grass which is a source
of much anxiety and considerable trouble to the farmers. There is a
water-mill here, too, very low, with ever a floury, mealy look, with
a pasty look often, as the flour becomes damp with the spray of the
water as it is thrown by the mill-wheel. It seems to be a tattered,
shattered, ramshackle concern, but it has been in the same family
for many years; and as the family has not hitherto been in distress,
it may be supposed that the mill still affords a fair means of
livelihood. The Brattles,--for Jacob Brattle is the miller's
name,--have ever been known as men who paid their way, and were able
to hold up their heads. But nevertheless Jacob Brattle is ever at
war with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) landlord in regard to repairs wanted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) mill,
and Mr. Gilmore, the landlord in question, declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wishes
that the Avon would some night run so high as to carry off the mill
altogether. Bullhampton is very quiet. There is no special trade
in the place. Its interests are altogether agricultural. It has
no newspaper. Its tendencies are altogether conservative. It is
a good deal given to religion; and the Primitive Methodists have
a very strong holding there, although in all Wiltshire there is
not a clergyman more popular in his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) own parish than the Rev. Frank
Fenwick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) himself, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) inner heart, rather likes his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) rival,
Mr. Puddleham, the dissenting minister; because Mr. Puddleham is an
earnest man, who, in spite of the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) ignorance, is
efficacious among the poor. But Mr. Fenwick is bound to keep up the
fight; and Mr. Puddleham considers it to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) duty to put down Mr.
Fenwick and the Church Establishment altogether.

<p/>The men of Bullhampton, and the women also, are aware that the glory
has departed from them, in that Bullhampton was once a borough, and
returned two members to Parliament. No borough more close, or shall
we say more rotten, ever existed. It was not that the Marquis of
Trowbridge had, what has often delicately been called, an interest in
it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) held it absolutely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) breeches pocket, to do with it
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) liked; and it had been the liking of the late Marquis to sell
one of the seats at every election to the highest bidder on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) side
in politics. Nevertheless, the people of Bullhampton had gloried
in being a borough, and the shame, or at least the regret of their
downfall, had not yet altogether passed away when the tidings of
a new Reform Bill came upon them. The people of Bullhampton are
notoriously slow to learn, and slow to forget. It was told of a
farmer of Bullhampton, in old days, that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) asked what had become of
Charles I., when told that Charles II. had been restored. Cromwell
had come and gone, and had not disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) at Bullhampton.

<p/>At Bullhampton there is no public building, except the church, which
indeed is a very handsome edifice with a magnificent tower, a thing
to go to see, and almost as worthy of a visit as its neighbour the
cathedral at Salisbury. The body of the church is somewhat low, but
its yellow-gray colour is perfect, and there is, moreover, a Norman
door, and there are Early English windows in the aisle, and a
perfection of perpendicular architecture in the chancel, all of which
should bring many visitors to Bullhampton; and there are brasses in
the nave, very curious, and one or two tombs of the Gilmore family,
very rare in their construction, and the churchyard is large and
green, and bowery, with the Avon flowing close under it, and nooks in
it which would make a man wish to die that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be buried there.
The church and churchyard of Bullhampton are indeed perfect, and yet
but few people go to see it. It has not as yet had its own bard to
sing its praises. Properly it is called Bullhampton Monachorum, the
living having belonged to the friars of Chiltern. The great tithes
now go to the Earl of Todmorden, who has no other interest in the
place whatever, and who never saw it. The benefice belongs to St.
John's, Oxford, and as the vicarage is not worth more than L400 a
year, it happens that a clergyman generally accepts it before he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) has
lived for twenty or thirty years in the common room of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) college.
Mr. Fenwick took it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) marriage, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was about twenty-seven,
and Bullhampton has been lucky.

<p/>The bulk of the parish belongs to the Marquis of Trowbridge, who,
however, has no residence within ten miles of it. The squire of the
parish is Squire Gilmore,--Harry Gilmore,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) possesses every
acre in it that is not owned by the Marquis. With the village, or
town as it may be, Mr. Gilmore has no concern; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) owns a large
tract of the water meads, and again has a farm or two up on the
downs as you go towards Chiltern. But they lie out of the parish of
Bullhampton. Altogether he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is a man of about fifteen hundred a year,
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is not as yet married, many a Wiltshire mother's eye is
turned towards Hampton Privets, as Mr. Gilmore's house is, somewhat
fantastically, named.

<p/>Mr. Gilmore's character must be made to develope itself in these
pages,--if such developing may be accomplished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is to be our
hero,--or at least one of two. The author will not, in these early
words, declare that the squire will be his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) favourite hero, as he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
will wish that his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) readers should form their own opinions on that
matter. At this period he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was a man somewhat over thirty,--perhaps
thirty-three years of age, who had done fairly well at Harrow and at
Oxford, but had never done enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) friends regard him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) as a
swan. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) still read a good deal; but he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) shot and fished more than he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
read, and had become, since his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) residence at the Privets, very fond
of the outside of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) books. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) went on buying books,
and was rather proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) library. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had travelled a good deal,
and was a politician,--somewhat scandalising his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) own tenants and
other Bullhamptonites by voting for the liberal candidates for his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
division of the county. The Marquis of Trowbridge did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>),
but regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) as an objectionable person, who did not understand
the nature of the duties which devolved upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) as a country
gentleman; and the Marquis himself was always spoken of by Mr.
Gilmore as--an idiot. On these various grounds the squire has
hitherto regarded himself as being a little in advance of other
squires, and has, perhaps, given himself more credit than he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) has
deserved for intellectuality. But he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) is a man with a good heart, and
a pure mind, generous, desirous of being just, somewhat sparing of
that which is his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) own, never desirous of that which is another's. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
is good-looking, though, perhaps, somewhat ordinary in appearance;
tall, strong, with dark-brown hair, and dark-brown whiskers, with
small, quick grey eyes, and teeth which are almost too white and too
perfect for a man. Perhaps it is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) greatest fault that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks
that as a liberal politician and as an English country gentleman he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
has combined in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own position all that is most desirable upon
earth. To have the acres without the acre-laden brains, is, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
thinks, everything.

<p/>And now it may be as well told at once that Mr. Gilmore is over head
and ears in love with a young lady to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) has offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) hand
and all that can be made to appertain to the future mistress of
Hampton Privets. And the lady is one who has nothing to give in
return but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart, and herself. The neighbours all
round the country have been saying for the last five years that Harry
Gilmore was looking out for an heiress; for it has always been told
of Harry, especially among those who have opposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in politics,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a keen eye for the main chance. But Mary Lowther has not,
and never can have, a penny with which to make up for any deficiency
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own personal attributes. But Mary is a lady, and Harry Gilmore
thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) the sweetest woman on whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) eye ever rested. Whatever
resolutions as to fortune-hunting he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) may have made,--though probably
none were ever made,--they have all now gone to the winds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is so
absolutely in love that nothing in the world is, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), at present
worth thinking about except Mary Lowther. I do not doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
would vote for a conservative candidate if Mary Lowther so ordered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>); or consent to go and live in New York if Mary Lowther would
accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) on no other condition. All Bullhampton parish is nothing
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) at the present moment, except as far as it is connected with
Mary Lowther. Hampton Privets is dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Privets</b></font>) only as far as it can be
made to look attractive in the eyes of Mary Lowther. The mill is to
be repaired, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Privets</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Privets</b></font>) will never get any interest on the
outlay, because Mary Lowther has said that Bullhampton water-meads
would be destroyed if the mill were to tumble down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Privets</b></font>) has drawn for
himself mental pictures of Mary Lowther till he (<font color='blue'><b>Privets</b></font>) has invested her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) with
every charm and grace and virtue that can adorn a woman. In very
truth he (<font color='blue'><b>Privets</b></font>) believes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to be perfect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Privets</b></font>) is actually and absolutely in
love. Mary Lowther has hitherto neither accepted nor rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>Privets</b></font>).
In a very few lines further on we will tell how the matter stands
between them.

<p/>It has already been told that the Rev. Frank Fenwick is Vicar of
Bullhampton. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was somewhat guided in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) taking of the
living by the fact that Harry Gilmore, the squire of the parish,
had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) very intimate friend at Oxford. Fenwick, at the period
with which we are about to begin our story, had been six years at
Bullhampton, and had been married about five and a half. Of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
something has already been said, and perhaps it may be only necessary
further to state that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) is a tall, fair-haired man, already becoming
somewhat bald on the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) head, with bright eyes, and the
slightest possible amount of whiskers, and a look about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) nose and
mouth which seems to imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could be severe if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) were not so
thoroughly good-humoured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has more of breeding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) appearance
than his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend,--a show of higher blood; though whence comes such
show, and how one discerns that appearance, few of us can tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
was a man who read more and thought more than Harry Gilmore, though
given much to athletics and very fond of field sports. It shall
only further be said of Frank Fenwick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) esteemed both his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
churchwardens and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) bishop, and was afraid of neither.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife had been a Miss Balfour, from Loring, in Gloucestershire,
and had had some considerable fortune. She (<font color='blue'><b>Balfour</b></font>) was now the mother of
four children, and, as Fenwick used to say, might have fourteen for
anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) also had possessed some small means
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own, there was no poverty, or prospect of poverty at the
vicarage, and the babies were made welcome as they came. Mrs. Fenwick
is as good a specimen of an English country parson's wife as you
shall meet in a county,--gay, good-looking, fond of the society
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), with a little dash of fun, knowing in blankets and
corduroys and coals and tea; knowing also as to beer and gin and
tobacco; acquainted with every man and woman in the parish; thinking
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband to be quite as good as the squire in regard to position,
and to be infinitely superior to the squire, or any other man in
the world, in regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal self;--a handsome, pleasant,
well-dressed lady, who has no nonsense about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Such a one was, and
is, Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/>Now the Balfours were considerable people at Loring, though their
property was not county property; and it was always considered that
Janet Balfour might have done better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did, in a worldly point
of view. Of that, however, little had been said at Loring, because it
soon became known there that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband stood rather well in
the country round about Bullhampton; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) asked Mary Lowther
to come and stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) for six months, Mary Lowther's aunt, Miss
Marrable, had nothing to say against the arrangement, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
herself was a most particular old lady, and always remembered that
Mary Lowther was third or fourth cousin to some earl in Scotland.
Nothing more shall be said of Miss Marrable at present, as it is
expedient, for the sake of the story, that the reader should fix his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
attention on Bullhampton till he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) find himself quite at home there.
I would wish him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) to know his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) way among the water meads, to be quite
alive to the fact that the lodge of Hampton Privets is a mile and a
quarter to the north of Bullhampton church, and half a mile across
the fields west from Brattle's mill; that Mr. Fenwick's parsonage
adjoins the churchyard, being thus a little farther from Hampton
Privets than the church; and that there commences Bullhampton street,
with its inn,--the Trowbridge Arms, its four public-houses, its three
bakers, and its two butchers. The bounds of the parsonage run down
to the river, so that the Vicar can catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) trout from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own
bank,--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) much prefers to catch them at distances which admit
of the appurtenances of sport.

<p/>Now there must be one word of Mary Lowther, and then the story shall
be commenced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had come to the vicarage in May, intending to stay
a month, and it was now August, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had been already three months
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) friend. Everybody said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was staying because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
intended to become the mistress of Hampton Privets. It was a month
since Harry Gilmore had formally made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) offer, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had not
refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) still stayed on, the folk of Bullhampton were
justified in their conclusions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was a tall girl, with dark brown
hair, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) wore fastened in a knot at the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) head,
after the simplest fashion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) eyes were large and grey, and full
of lustre; but they were not eyes which would make you say that Mary
Lowther was especially a bright-eyed girl. They were eyes, however,
which could make you think, when they looked at you, that if Mary
Lowther would only like you, how happy your lot would be,--that if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would love you, the world would have nothing higher or better to
offer. If you judged her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) face by any rules of beauty, you would say
that it was too thin; but feeling its influence with sympathy, you
could never wish it to be changed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) nose and mouth were perfect.
How many little noses there are on young women's faces which of
themselves cannot be said to be things of beauty, or joys for ever,
although they do very well in their places! There is the softness
and colour of youth, and perhaps a dash of fun, and the eyes above
are bright, and the lips below alluring. In the midst of such sweet
charms, what does it matter that the nose be puggish,--or even a
nose of putty, such as you think you might improve in the original
material by a squeeze of your thumb and forefinger? But with Mary
Lowther her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) nose itself was a feature of exquisite beauty, a feature
that could be eloquent with pity, reverence, or scorn. The curves of
the nostrils, with their almost transparent membranes, told of the
working of the mind within, as every portion of human face should
tell--in some degree. And the mouth was equally expressive, though
the lips were thin. It was a mouth to watch, and listen to, and read
with curious interest, rather than a mouth to kiss. Not but that
the desire to kiss would come, when there might be a hope to kiss
with favour;--but they were lips which no man would think to ravage
in boisterous play. It might have been said that there was a want
of capability for passion in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) face, had it not been for the
well-marked dimple in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) little chin,--that soft couch in which one
may be always sure, when one sees it, that some little imp of Love
lies hidden.

<p/>It has already been said that Mary Lowther was tall,--taller than
common. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) back was as lovely a form of womanhood as man's eye ever
measured and appreciated. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) movements, which were never naturally
quick, had a grace about them which touched men and women alike. It
was the very poetry of motion; but its chief beauty consisted in
this, that it was what it was by no effort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own. We have all
seen those efforts, and it may be that many of us have liked them
when they have been made on our own behalf. But no man as yet could
ever have felt himself to be so far flattered by Miss Lowther. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
dress was very plain; as it became her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) that it should be, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was
living on the kindness of an aunt who was herself not a rich woman.
But it may be doubted whether dress could have added much to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
charms.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was now turned one-and-twenty, and though, doubtless, there were
young men at Loring who had sighed for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) smiles, no young man had
sighed with any efficacy. It must be acknowledged, indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was not a girl for whom the most susceptible of young men would sigh.
Young men given to sigh are generally attracted by some outward and
visible sign of softness which may be taken as an indication that
sighing will produce some result, however small. At Loring it was
said that Mary Lowther was cold and repellent, and, on that account,
one who might very probably descend to the shades as an old maid in
spite of the beauty of which she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was the acknowledged possessor. No
enemy, no friend, had ever accused her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) of being a flirt.

<p/>Such as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was, Harry Gilmore's passion for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) much astonished his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
friends. Those who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) best had thought that, as regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
fate matrimonial,--or non-matrimonial,--there were three chances
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) might carry out their presumed intention of marrying
money; or he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) might become the sudden spoil of the bow and spear of
some red-cheeked lass; or he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) might walk on as an old bachelor, too
cautious to be caught at all. But none believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would become
the victim of a grand passion for a poor, reticent, high-bred,
high-minded specimen of womanhood. Such, however, was now his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
condition.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had an uncle, a clergyman, living at Salisbury, a prebendary
there, who was a man of the world, and in whom Harry trusted more
than in any other member of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own family. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother had been
the sister of the Rev. Henry Fitzackerly Chamberlaine; and as Mr.
Chamberlaine had never married, much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) solicitude was bestowed
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) nephew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, my dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prebendary</b></font>)</div>had been the prebendary's advice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was
taken over to see Miss Lowther. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) is a lady, no doubt; but you
would never be your own master, and you would be a poor man till you
died. An easy temper and a little money are almost as common in our
rank of life as destitution and obstinacy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Gilmore/Gilmore</b></font>)</div>On the day after this
advice was given, Harry Gilmore made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) formal offer.




<p/>CHAPTER II.

<p/>FLO``S RED BALL.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an answer, dear, one way or the other.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>These
wise words were spoken by Mrs. Fenwick to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend as they sat
together, with their work in their hands, on a garden seat under a
cedar tree. It was an August evening after dinner, and the Vicar was
out about his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) parish. The two elder children were playing in the
garden, and the two young women were alone together.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``You should give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an answer, dear, one way
or the other.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an answer. What answer does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what answer he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wishes. If any man was ever in earnest he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I not doing the best I can for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then in waiting--to see
whether I can say yes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot be well for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be in suspense on such a matter; and,
dear Mary, it cannot be well for you either. One always feels that
when a girl bids a man to wait, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) after a while. It
always comes to that. If you had been at home at Loring, the time
would not have been much; but, being so near to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
every day, must be bad. You must both be in a state of fever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will go back to Loring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not now, till you have positively made up your mind, and given
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an answer one way or the other. You could not go now and leave
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in doubt. Take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once, and have done with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is as good
as gold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>In answer to this, Mary for a while said nothing, but went sedulously
on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>said a little girl, running up, followed by a nursery-maid,
<div class="bookquote">``the ball's in the water!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The child was a beautiful fair-haired little darling about
four-and-a-half years old, and a boy, a year younger, and a little
shorter, and a little stouter, was toddling after her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The ball in the water, Flo! Can't Jim get it out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jim's gone, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Jane, the nursery-maid, proceeded to explain that the ball had
rolled in and had been carried down the stream to some bushes, and
that it was caught there just out of reach of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), Jane,
could do with a long stick for its recovery. Jim, the gardener, was
not to be found; and they were in despair lest the ball should become
wet through and should perish.

<p/>Mary at once saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opportunity of escape,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opportunity for that
five minutes of thought by herself which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) needed. <div class="bookquote">``I'll come, Flo,
and see what can be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do; 'cause you is so big,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the little girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll see if my long arms won't do as well as Jim's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary;
<div class="bookquote">``only Jim would go in, perhaps, which I certainly shall not do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took Flo by the hand, and together they ran down to the margin of
the river.

<p/>There lay the treasure, a huge red inflated ball, just stopped in its
downward current by a short projecting stick. Jim could have got it
certainly, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could have suspended himself over the stream
from a bough, and could have dislodged the ball, and have floated it
on to the bank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lean over, Mary,--a great deal, and we'll hold you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Flo</b></font>)</div>said Flo, to
whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Flo</b></font>) ball was at this moment worth any effort. Mary did lean
over, and poked at it, and at last thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would trust
herself to the bough, as Jim would have done, and became more
and more venturous, and at last touched the ball, and then, at
last,--fell into the river! Immediately there was a scream and a
roar, and a splashing about of skirts and petticoats, and by the
time that Mrs. Fenwick was on the bank, Mary Lowther had extricated
herself, and had triumphantly brought out Flo's treasure with her (<font color='blue'><b>Flo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary, are you hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Flo</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What should hurt me? Oh dear, oh dear! I never fell into a river
before. My darling Flo, don't be unhappy. It's such good fun. Only
you mustn't fall in yourself, till you're as big as I am.''  (<font color='red'><b>Flo</b></font>)</div>Flo was in
an agony of tears, not deigning to look at the rescued ball.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not mean that your head has been under?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My face was, and I felt so odd. For about half a moment I had a
sound of Ophelia in my ears. Then I was laughing at myself for being
such a goose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better come up and go to bed, dear; and I'll get you something
warm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't go to bed, and I won't have anything warm; but I will change
my clothes. What an adventure! What will Mr. Fenwick say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will Mr. Gilmore say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>To this Mary Lowther made no answer, but
went straight up to the house, and into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) room, and changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
clothes.

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was there Fenwick and Gilmore both appeared at the open
window of the drawing-room in which Mrs. Fenwick was sitting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had
known well enough that Harry Gilmore would not let the evening pass
without coming to the vicarage, and at one time had hoped to persuade
Mary Lowther to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) verdict on this very day. Both she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
husband were painfully anxious that Harry might succeed. Fenwick had
loved the man dearly for many years, and Janet Fenwick had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband's friend. They both felt that
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was showing more of manhood than they had expected from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in the
persistency of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) love, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) deserved his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reward. And they
both believed also that for Mary herself it would be a prosperous and
a happy marriage. And then, where is the married woman who does not
wish that the maiden friend who comes to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should find a
husband in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) house? The parson and his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wife were altogether of one
mind in this matter, and thought that Mary Lowther ought to be made
to give herself to Harry Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think has happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, coming to the
window, which opened down to the ground. <div class="bookquote">``Mary Lowther has fallen
into the river.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fallen where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Gilmore/Gilmore</b></font>)</div>shouted Gilmore, putting up both his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) hands, and
seeming to prepare himself to rush away among the river gods in
search of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be alarmed, Mr. Gilmore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)'s upstairs, quite safe,--only she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
has had a ducking.''  (<font color='red'><b>the papa</b></font>)</div>Then the circumstances were explained, and the
papa declared magisterially that Flo must not play any more with her (<font color='blue'><b>Flo</b></font>)
ball near the river,--an order to which it was not probable that much
close attention would ever be paid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose Miss Lowther will have gone to bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Gilmore/Gilmore</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) every moment. I suggested bed, and
warm drinks, and cossetting; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would have none of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
scrambled out all by herself, and seemed to think it very good fun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in at any rate and have some tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``If you
start before eleven, I'll walk half the way back with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>In the mean time, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Flo</b></font>) accident, Mary had gained the
opportunity that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had required. The point for self-meditation was
not so much whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would or would not accept Mr. Gilmore now,
as that other point;--was she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) or was she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) not wrong to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) in
suspense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew very well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) now. It
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that a girl should know a man very thoroughly before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be justified in trusting herself altogether to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knowledge of Mr. Gilmore was insufficient.
It might however be the case that in such circumstances duty required
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) at once an unhesitating answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not find
herself to be a bit nearer to knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) and to loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
was a month since. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend Janet had complained again and again of
the suspense to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) was subjecting the man;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) knew on
the other hand that her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) friend Janet did this in her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) intense anxiety
to promote the match. Was it wrong to say to the man--<div class="bookquote">``I will wait
and try?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) friend told her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) that to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) would wait and
try, was in truth to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) would take him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at some future
time;--that any girl who said so had almost committed herself to
such a decision;--that the very fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was waiting and trying
to love a man ought to bind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to the man at last. Such certainly
had not been her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own idea. As far as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could at present look into
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own future feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not think that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could ever
bring herself to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would be this man's wife. There was a
solemnity about the position which had never come fully home to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been thus placed. Everybody around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that
the man's happiness was really bound up in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reply. If this were
so,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in truth believed that it was so,--was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not bound
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) every chance in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) power? And yet because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still
doubted, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was told by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friend that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was behaving badly! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
would believe her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friend, would confess her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fault, and would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
lover in what most respectful words of denial she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could mould, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not be his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife. For herself personally, there would be no
sorrow in this, and no regret.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ducking had given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) time for all this thought; and then, having
so decided, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went downstairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was met, of course, with various
inquiries about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bath. Mr. Gilmore was all pity, as though the
accident were the most serious thing in the world. Mr. Fenwick
was all mirth, as though there had never been a better joke. Mrs.
Fenwick, who was perhaps unwise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) impatience, was specially
anxious that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) two guests might be left together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not
believe that Mary Lowther would ever say the final No; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
thought also that, if it were so, the time had quite come in which
Mary Lowther ought to say the final Yes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go down and look at the spot,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) said, after tea.

<p/>So they went down. It was a beautiful August night. There was no
moon, and the twilight was over; but still it was not absolutely
dark; and the air was as soft as a mother's kiss to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sleeping
child. They walked down together, four abreast, across the lawn, and
thence they reached a certain green orchard path that led down to the
river. Mrs. Fenwick purposely went on with the lover, leaving Mary
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband, in order that there might be no appearance of a
scheme. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would return with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband, and then there might be a
ramble among the paths, and the question would be pressed, and the
thing might be settled.

<p/>They saw through the gloom the spot where Mary had scrambled, and
the water which had then been bright and smiling, was now black and
awful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think that you should have been in there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Gilmore/Gilmore</b></font>)</div>said Harry Gilmore,
shuddering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) should ever have got out again!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks frightful in the dark,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick. <div class="bookquote">``Come away,
Frank. It makes me sick.''  (<font color='red'><b>the schemer</b></font>)</div>And the charming schemer took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband's
arm, and continued the round of the garden. <div class="bookquote">``I have been talking to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The other pair of course followed them. Mary's mind was so fully made
up, at this moment, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) almost wished that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) companion might
ask the question. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was misusing him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>); and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would misuse him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a firm No, as it were, within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) grasp, and a resolution that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not be driven from it. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) walked on beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) talking of the water, and of the danger, and
of the chance of a cold, and got no nearer to the subject than to
bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) think what suffering she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have caused had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) failed
to extricate herself from the pool. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) also had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) mind.
Something had been said by himself of a certain day when last he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had
pleaded his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) cause; and that day would not come round till the morrow.
He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) considered himself pledged to restrain himself till then; but on
the morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/>There was a little gate which led from the parsonage garden through
the churchyard to a field path, by which was the nearest way to
Hampton Privets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``because I don't want to make Fenwick
come out again to-night. You won't mind going up through the garden
alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, Miss Lowther,--pray, pray take care of yourself. I hardly think
you ought to have been out again to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was nothing, Mr. Gilmore. You make infinitely too much of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I make too much of anything that regards you? You will be at
home to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I fancy so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do remain at home. I intend to come down after lunch. Do remain at
home.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) by the hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) promised
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) clearly was entitled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) obedience
on such a point. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slowly made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) way round the garden, and
entered the house at the front door, some quarter of an hour after
the others.

<p/>Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>)? What was it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted in the world?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) manners, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) character, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) ways, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) mode of
life, and after a fashion she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) person. If there was more of
love in the world than this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not think that it would ever
come in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) way. Up to this time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never felt any
such feeling. If not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own sake, why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) not do it for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>)? Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) not be made happy? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had risked a plunge in the
water to get Flo her (<font color='blue'><b>Flo</b></font>) ball, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Flo</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Flo</b></font>) liked
Flo. It seemed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Flo</b></font>) mind had been altogether changed by that
stroll through the dark alleys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet/Janet Fenwick/JANET FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Janet, <div class="bookquote">``how is it to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Janet/Janet Fenwick/JANET FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is to come to-morrow, and I do not know how it will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>)
said, turning away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) own room.




<p/>CHAPTER III.

<p/>SAM BRATTLE.


<p/>It was about eleven o'clock when Gilmore passed through the wicket
leading from the vicarage garden to the churchyard. The path he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was
about to take crossed simply a corner of the church precincts, as it
came at once upon a public footway leading from the fields through
the churchyard to the town. There was, of course, no stopping the
public path, but Fenwick had been often advised to keep a lock on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
own gate, as otherwise it almost seemed that the vicarage gardens
were open to all Bullhampton. But the lock had never been put on. The
gate was the way by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) family went to the church, and
the parson was accustomed to say that however many keys there might
be provided, he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) knew that there would never be one in his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) pocket
when he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wanted it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was wont to add, when his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wife would tease
him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) on the subject, that they who desired to come in decently were
welcome, and that they who were minded to make an entrance indecently
would not be debarred by such rails and fences as hemmed in the
vicarage grounds. Gilmore, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) passed through the corner of the
churchyard, clearly saw a man standing near to the stile leading from
the fields. Indeed, this man was quite close to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), although, from
the want of light and the posture of the man, the face was invisible
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the fellow to be a stranger to Bullhampton. The
dress was strange, the manner was strange, and the mode of standing
was strange. Gilmore had lived at Bullhampton all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) life, and,
without much thought on the subject, knew Bullhampton ways. The
jacket which the man wore was a town-made jacket, a jacket that had
come farther a-field even than Salisbury; and the man's gaiters had a
savour which was decidedly not of Wiltshire. Dark as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
see so much as this. <div class="bookquote">``Good night, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore, in a
sharp cheery voice. The man muttered something, and passed on as
though to the village. There had, however, been something in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
position which made Gilmore think that the stranger had intended
to trespass on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend's garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) crossed the stile into the
fields, however, without waiting,--without having waited for half a
moment, and immediately saw the figure of a second man standing down,
hidden as it were in the ditch; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could discover no more
than the cap and shoulders of the man through the gloom, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sure
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew who it was that owned the cap and shoulders. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not speak
again, but passed on quickly, thinking what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might best do. The
man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen and recognised had latterly been talked of as a
discredit to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family, and anything but an honour to the usually
respectable inhabitants of Bullhampton.

<p/>On the further side of the church from the town was a farmyard, in
the occupation of one of Lord Trowbridge's tenants,--a man who had
ever been very keen at preventing the inroads of trespassers, to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, perhaps, been driven by the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) land was
traversed by various public pathways. Now a public pathway through
pasture is a nuisance, as it is impossible to induce those who use
it to keep themselves to one beaten track; but a pathway through
cornfields is worse, for, let what pains may be taken, wheat,
beans, and barley will be torn down and trampled under foot. And
yet in apportioning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rents, no landlord takes all this into
consideration. Farmer Trumbull considered it a good deal, and was
often a wrathful man. There was at any rate no right of way across
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) farmyard, and here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might keep as big a dog as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chose,
chained or unchained. Harry Gilmore knew the dog well, and stood for
a moment leaning on the gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who be there?''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the voice of the farmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Mr. Trumbull? It is I,--Mr. Gilmore. I want to get
round to the front of the parson's house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Zurely, zurely,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer, coming forward and opening the
gate. <div class="bookquote">``Be there anything wrong about, Squire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I think there is. Speak softly. I fancy there are men
lying in the churchyard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I be a-thinking so, too, Squire. Bone'm was a growling just now like
the old `un.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>Bone'm was the name of the bull-dog as to which Gilmore
had been solicitous as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) looked over the gate. <div class="bookquote">``What is't t`ey're up
to? Not bugglary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our friend's apricots, perhaps. But I'll just move round to the
front. Do you and Bone'm keep a look-out here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never fear, Squire; never fear. Me and Bone'm together is a`most too
much for 'em, bugglars and all.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) led Mr. Gilmore through the
farmyard, and out on to the road, Bone'm growling a low growl as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
passed away.

<p/>The Squire hurried along the high road, past the church, and in at
the Vicarage front gate. Knowing the place well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could have made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) way round into the garden; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thought it better to go to
the front door. There was no light to be seen from the windows; but
almost all the rooms of the house looked out into the garden at the
back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) knocked sharply, and in a minute or two the door was opened
by the parson in person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Frank,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloo! is that you? What's up now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Men who ought to be in bed. I came across two men hanging about your
gate in the churchyard, and I'm not sure there wasn't a third.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're up to nothing. They often sit and smoke there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These fellows were up to something. The man I saw plainest was a
stranger, and just the sort of man who won't do your parishioners any
good to be among them. The other was Sam Brattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whew--w--w,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) has gone utterly to the dogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)'s on the road, Harry; but nobody has gone while he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s still going.
I had some words with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father's presence last week, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) followed me afterwards, and told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d see it out with me. I
wouldn't tell you, because I didn't want to set you more against
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish they were out of the place,--the whole lot of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that they'd do better elsewhere than here. I suppose
Mr. Sam is going to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) word with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only for the look of that other fellow, I shouldn't think they meant
anything serious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose they do, but I'll be on the look-out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I stay with you, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; I've a life-preserver, and I'll take a round of the gardens.
You come with me, and you can pass home that way. The chances
are they'll mizzle away to bed, as they've seen you, and heard
Bone'm,--and probably heard too every word you said to Trumbull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) then got his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hat and the short, thick stick of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had
spoken, and turning the key of the door, put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) pocket. Then
the two friends went round by the kitchen garden, and so through to
the orchard, and down to the churchyard gate. Hitherto they had seen
nothing, and heard nothing, and Fenwick was sure that the men had
made their way through the churchyard to the village.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But they may come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be about if they do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is one against three? You had better let me stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Fenwick laughed at this, saying that it would be quite as rational to
propose that they should keep watch every night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, hark!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, with a mind evidently perturbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you be alarmed about us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If anything should happen to Mary Lowther!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, no doubt, is matter of anxiety, to which may, perhaps, be
added some trifle of additional feeling on the score of Janet and the
children. But I'll do my best. If the women knew that you and I were
patrolling the place, they'd be frightened out of their wits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Gilmore, who never liked that there should be a laugh against
himself, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) leave and walked home across the fields. Fenwick
passed up through the garden, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was near the terrace which
ran along the garden front of the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) heard
a voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) stood under the shade of a wall dark with ivy, and
distinctly heard whispering on the other side of it. As far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
could tell there were the voices of more than two men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wished now
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had kept Gilmore with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>),--not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was personally afraid
of the trespassers, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) courage was of that steady settled kind
which enables the possessor to remember that men who are doing deeds
of darkness are ever afraid of those whom they are injuring; but had
there been an ally with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) prospect of catching one or more of
the ruffians would have been greatly increased. Standing where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would probably be able to interrupt them, should they attempt to
enter the house; but in the mean time they might be stripping his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
fruit from the wall. They were certainly, at present, in the kitchen
garden, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was not minded to leave them there at such work as
they might have in hand. Having paused to think of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) crept
along under the wall, close to the house, towards the passage by
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could reach them. But they had not heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), nor had they
waited among the fruit. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was near the corner of the wall, one
leading man came round within a foot or two of the spot on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stood; and, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could decide on what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do, the second
had appeared. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rushed forward with the loaded stick in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand,
but, knowing its weight, and remembering the possibility of the
comparative innocence of the intruders, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hesitated to strike. A
blow on the head would have brained a man, and a knock on the arm
with such an instrument would break the bone. In a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left hand on the leading man's throat, and the man's foot behind
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heel. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did strike heavily, cutting
upwards with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) weapon, and bringing the heavy weight of lead at the
end of it on to the man's shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stumbled rather than fell, but
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regained his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) footing, the man was gone. That man was gone,
and two others were following him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down towards the gate at the bottom
of the orchard. Of these two, in a few strides, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was able to catch
the hindermost, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found himself wrestling with Sam Brattle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), speaking as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) short breath,
<div class="bookquote">``if you don't stand, I'll strike you with the life-preserver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sam made another struggle, trying to seize the weapon, and the parson
hit him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) with it on the right arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've smashed that anyway, Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not; but do you come along with me quietly, or I'll smash
something else. I'll hit you on the head if you attempt to move away.
What were you doing here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div><p/>Brattle made no answer, but walked along towards the house at the
parson's left hand, the parson holding him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) the while by the neck of
his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) jacket, and swinging the life-preserver in his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) right hand. In
this way he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) round to the front of the house, and then began
to think what he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) would do with him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That, after all, you should be at this work, Sam!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What work is it, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prowling about my place, after midnight, with a couple of strange
blackguards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't so much harm in that, as I knows of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who were the men, Sam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was the men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--who were they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just friends of mine, Mr. Fenwick. I shan't say no more about 'em.
You've got me, and you've smashed my arm, and now what is it you're
a-going to do with me? I ain't done no harm,--only just walked about,
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>To tell the truth, our friend the parson did not quite know what he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
meant to do with the Tartar he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had caught. There were reasons which
made him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) very unwilling to hand over Sam Brattle to the village
constable. Sam had a mother and sister who were among the Vicar's
first favourites in the parish; and though old Jacob Brattle, the
father, was not so great a favourite, and was a man whom the Squire,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) landlord, held in great disfavour, Mr. Fenwick would desire, if
possible, to spare the family. And of Sam, himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had had high
hopes, though those hopes, for the last eighteen months had been
becoming fainter and fainter. Upon the whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was much averse to
knocking up the groom, the only man who lived on the parsonage except
himself, and dragging Sam into the village. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``what you and your friends were going to do. I hardly think it has
come to that with you, that you'd try to break into the house and cut
our throats.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We warn't after no breaking in, nor no cutting of throats, Mr.
Fenwick. We warn't indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall you do with yourself, to-night, if I let you off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just go home to father's, sir; not a foot else, s`help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of your friends, as you call them, will have to go to the
doctor, if I am not very much mistaken; for the rap I gave you was
nothing to what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) got. You're all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It hurt, sir, I can tell ye;--but that won't matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Sam,--there; you may go. I shall be after you to-morrow, and
the last word I say to you, to-night, is this;--as far as I can see,
you're on the road to the gallows. It isn't pleasant to be hung, and
I would advise you to change your road.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) let go his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
hold, and stood waiting till Sam should have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be a-coming after me, to-morrow, parson, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the
man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall see your mother, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dont`ee tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of my being here, Mr. Fenwick, and nobody shan't
ever come anigh this place again,--not in the way of prigging
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You fool, you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think that it is to save
anything that I might lose, that I let you go now? Don't you know
that the thing I want to save is you,--you,--you; you helpless, idle,
good-for-nothing reprobate? Go home, and be sure that I shall do the
best I can according to my lights. I fear that my lights are bad
lights, in that they have allowed me to let you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had seen Sam take his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) departure through the front gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
returned to the house, and found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) wife, who had gone to bed,
had come down-stairs in search of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Frank, you have frightened me so terribly! Where have you been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thief-catching. And I'm afraid I've about split one fellow's back. I
caught another, but I let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth do you mean, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the whole story,--how Gilmore had seen the men, and
had come up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>); how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had gone out and had a tussle with one
man, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) thought, hurt; and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had then caught
another, while the third escaped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We ain't safe in our beds, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>said the wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ain't safe in yours, my dear, because you chose to leave it; but
I hope you're safe out of it. I doubt whether the melons and peaches
are safe. The truth is, there ought to be a gardener's cottage on
the place, and I must build one. I wonder whether I hurt that fellow
much. I seemed to hear the bone crunch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Frank!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what could I do? I got that thing because I thought it safer
than a pistol, but I really think it's worse. I might have murdered
them all, if I'd lost my temper,--and just for half-a-dozen
apricots!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what became of the man you took?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without doing anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got a tap too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The parson</b></font>)</div><p/>The parson was silent for a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It was
Sam Brattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sam Brattle, coming to rob?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)'s been at it, I fear, for months, in some shape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what shall you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know as yet. It would about kill her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) and Fanny, if they
were told all that I suspect. They are stiff-necked, obstinate,
ill-conditioned people--that is, the men. But I think Gilmore has
been a little hard on them. The father and brother are honest men.
Come;--we'll go to bed.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IV.

<p/>THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.


<p/>On the following morning there was of course a considerable amount
of conversation at the Vicarage as to the affairs of the previous
evening. There was first of all an examination of the fruit; but as
this was made without taking Jem the gardener into confidence, no
certain conclusion could be reached. It was clear, however, that no
robbery for the purpose of sale had been made. An apricot or two
might have been taken, and perhaps an assault made on an unripe
peach. Mr. Fenwick was himself nearly sure that garden spoliation was
not the purpose of the assailants, though it suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to let his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
wife entertain that idea. The men would hardly have come from the
kitchen garden up to the house and round the corner at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had
met them, if they were seeking fruit. Presuming it to have been their
intention to attempt the drawing-room windows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would have expected
to meet them as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did meet them. From the garden the Vicar and the
two ladies went down to the gate, and from thence over the stile to
Farmer Trumbull's farmyard. The farmer had not again seen the men,
after the Squire had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heard them. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) the
parson said nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) encounter, and nothing of that blow on
the man's back. From thence Mr. Fenwick went on to the town, and the
ladies returned to the Vicarage.

<p/>The only person whom the parson at once consulted was the
surgeon,--Dr. Cuttenden, as he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was called. No man with an injured
shoulder-blade had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) last night or that morning. A man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said, might receive a very violent blow on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, in the manner
in which the fellow had been struck, and might be disabled for days
from any great personal exertion, without having a bone broken.
If the blade of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shoulder were broken, the man--so thought the
doctor--could not travel far on foot, would hardly be able to get
away to any of the neighbouring towns unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were carried. Of
Sam Brattle the parson said nothing to the doctor; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had
finished his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) morning's work about the town, he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) walked on to the mill.

<p/>In the mean time the two ladies remained at home at the Parsonage.
The excitement occasioned by the events of the previous night was
probably a little damaged by the knowledge that Mr. Gilmore was
coming. The coming of Mr. Gilmore on this occasion was so important
that even the terrible idea of burglars, and the sensation arising
from the use of that deadly weapon which had been produced at the
breakfast table during the morning, were robbed of some of their
interest. They did not keep possession of the minds of the two ladies
as they would have done had there been no violent interrupting cause.
But here was the violent interrupting cause, and by the time that
lunch was on the table, Sam Brattle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) comrades were forgotten.

<p/>Very little was said between the two women on that morning respecting
Mr. Gilmore. Mrs. Fenwick, who had allowed herself to be convinced
that Mary would act with great impropriety if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not accept
the man, thought that further speech might only render her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend
obstinate. Mary, who knew the inside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend's mind very
clearly, and who loved and respected her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend, could hardly fix her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
own mind. During the past night it had been fixed, or nearly fixed,
two different ways. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had first determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would refuse
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lover,--as to which resolve, for some hours or so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been
very firm; then that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would accept him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>),--as to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
ever, when most that way inclined, entertained some doubt as to the
possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) uttering that word <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it be that other women don't love better than I love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I
wonder that they ever get married at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was wrong to keep the man in suspense, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
believed it. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) not been so told, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have thought that
some further waiting would have been of the three alternatives the
best.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be upstairs with the bairns,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) left
the dining-room after lunch, <div class="bookquote">``so that if you prefer the garden to the
drawing-room, it will be free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, how solemn and ceremonious you make it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is solemn, Mary; I don't know how anything can be more solemn,
short of going to heaven or the other place. But I really don't see
why there should be any doubt or difficulty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something in the tone in which these words were said which
almost made Mary Lowther again decide against the man. The man had a
home and an income, and was Squire of the parish; and therefore there
need be no difficulty! When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) compared Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Gilmore
together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) liked Mr. Fenwick the best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) thought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to be the more clever, the higher spirited, the most of a man of
the two. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) certainly was not the least in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) friend's
husband; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was just as little in love with Mr. Gilmore.

<p/>At about half-past two Mr. Gilmore made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) appearance, standing at
the open window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I come in?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you may come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Fenwick is not here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) is in the house, I think, if you want her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no. I hope you were not frightened last night. I have not seen
Frank this morning; but I hear from Mr. Trumbull that there was
something of a row.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a row, certainly. Mr. Fenwick struck some of the men, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) is afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) hurt one of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had broken their heads. I take it there was a son of one
of my tenants there, who is about as bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) can be. Frank will
believe me now. I hope you were not frightened here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard nothing of it till this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After that there was a pause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had told himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) came along
that the task before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could not be easy and pleasant. To declare a
passion to the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) loves may be very pleasant work to the man who
feels almost sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answer will not be against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It may be
an easy task enough even when there is a doubt. The very possession
of the passion,--or even its pretence,--gives the man a liberty which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a pleasure and a pride in using. But this is the case when the
man dashes boldly at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) purpose without preconcerted arrangements.
Such pleasure, if it ever was a pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--such excitement at
least, was come and gone with Harry Gilmore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) tale,
and had been desired to wait. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had come again at a fixed hour
to be informed--like a servant waiting for a place--whether it was
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would suit. The servant out of place, however, would
have had this advantage, that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would receive his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) answer without the
necessity of further eloquence on his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own part. With the lover it was
different. It was evident that Mary Lowther would not say to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I
have considered the matter, and I think that, upon the whole, you
will do.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It was necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) should ask the question again, and
ask it as a suppliant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said, beginning with words that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had fixed for himself
as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) came up the garden, <div class="bookquote">``it is six weeks, I think, since I asked
you to be my wife; and now I have come to ask you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) no immediate answer, but sat as though waiting for some
further effort of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) eloquence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think you doubt my truth, or the warmth of my affection. If
you trust in them--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do; I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't know that I can say anything further. Nothing that
I can say now will make you love me. I have not that sort of power
which would compel a girl to come into my arms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand that kind of power,--how any man can have it with
any girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say that it is so; but I do not flatter myself that it is so
with me; and I do not think that it would be so with any man over
you. Perhaps I may assure you that, as far as I know myself at
present, all my future happiness must depend on your answer. It will
not kill me--to be refused; at least, I suppose not. But it will make
me wish that it would.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Having so spoken he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) reply.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) believed every word that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) so well that,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own sake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) desired that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) might be gratified. As far as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) knew herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had no desire to be Harry Gilmore's wife. The
position was not even one in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could allow herself to look
for consolation on one side, for disappointments on the other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
had read about love, and talked about love; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) desired to be
in love. Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was not in love with this man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had begun
to doubt whether it would ever be given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to love,--to love as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) friend Janet loved Frank Fenwick. Janet loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) husband's very
footsteps, and seemed to eat with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) palate, hear with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ears, and
see with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) was, as it were, absolutely a bone from her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>)
husband's rib. Mary thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could never
have that same feeling towards Henry Gilmore. And yet it might come;
or something might come which would do almost as well. It was likely
that Janet's nature was softer and sweeter than her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) own,--more prone
to adapt itself, like ivy to a strong tree. For herself, it might be,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) could never become as the ivy; but that, nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>)
might be the true wife of a true husband. But if ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) was to be
the true wife of Harry Gilmore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) could not to-day say that it
should be so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I must answer you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) said, very gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you tell me that you are not ready to do so I will wait, and come
again. I shall never change my mind. You may be sure of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that is just what I may not do, Mr. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who says so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My own feelings tell me so. I have no right to keep you in suspense,
and I will not do it. I respect and esteem you most honestly. I have
so much liking for you that I do not mind owning that I wish that it
were more. Mr. Gilmore, I like you so much that I would make a great
sacrifice for you; but I cannot sacrifice my own honesty or your
happiness by making believe that I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) sat silent, and then there came over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) face a
look of inexpressible anguish,--a look as though the pain were almost
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could bear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) could not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) face;
and, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) woman's pity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) almost wished that her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) words had been
different.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And must that be all?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What else can I say, Mr. Gilmore?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that must be all, it will be to me a doom that I shall not know
how to bear. I cannot live here without you. I have thought about you
till you have become mixed with every tree and every cottage about
the place. I did not know of myself that I could become such a slave
to a passion. Mary, say that you will wait again. Try it once more.
I would not ask for this, but that you have told me that there was no
one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, there is no one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let me wait again. It can do you no harm. If there should come
any man more fortunate than I am, you can tell me, and I shall know
that it is over. I ask no sacrifice from you, and no pledge; but I
give you mine. I shall not change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There must be no such promise, Mr. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is the promise. I certainly shall not change. When three
months are over I will come to you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) tried to think whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) was bound to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) answer
must be taken as final, or whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) might allow the matter to
stand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) proposed, with some chance of a result that might be good
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). On one point she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) was quite sure,--that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) now,
with an understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) should again renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) offer after a
period of three months, she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) must go away from Bullhampton. If there
was any possibility that she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) should learn to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), such feeling
would arise within her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) more quickly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) absence than in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
presence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) would go home to Loring, and try to bring herself to
accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that what we now say had better be the last of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall not be the last of it. I will try again. What is there that
I can do, so that I may make myself worthy of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no question of worthiness, Mr. Gilmore. Who can say how his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
heart is moved,--and why? I shall go home to Loring; and you may be
sure of this, that if there be anything that you should hear of me, I
will let you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own, held it for a while, pressed it to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) lips, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) was by no means contented with herself,
and, to tell the truth, was ashamed to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) friend know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>)
had done. And yet how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) have answered him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in other words? It
might be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) could teach herself to be contented with the amount
of regard which she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) entertained for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). It might be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) could
persuade herself to be his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife; and if so, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) not have
the chance,--the chance which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) professed that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was so anxious to
retain? He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) the greatest compliment which a man can pay a
woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) owed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) everything,--except herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) was hardly
sure even now that if the proposition had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) by letter the
answer might not have been of a different nature.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) went upstairs to the nursery, and thence
to Mrs. Fenwick's bedroom. Flo was there, but Flo was soon dismissed.
Mary began her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) story instantly, before a question could be asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Janet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am going home--at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it is best. Nothing more is settled than was settled before.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) asks me whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) may come again, how can I say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) may
not? What can I say, except that as far I can see now, I cannot be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that you would, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) had asked you last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly I should not. I may doubt when I am talking behind
his (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) back; but when I meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) face to face I cannot do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you have been wrong,--very wrong and very foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In not taking a man I do not love?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but you are longing for you do not know what; some
romance,--some grand passion,--something that will never come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you what I want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A feeling such as you have for Frank. You are my model; I want
nothing beyond that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That comes after marriage. Frank was very little to me till we were
man and wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)'ll tell you the same. I don't know whether I didn't
almost dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) when I married him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Janet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly the sort of love you are thinking of comes
afterwards;--when the interests of two people are the same. Frank was
very well as a lover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I remember it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was fifteen; and don't I remember how all the world used to change
for you when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was coming? There wasn't a ribbon you wore but you
wore it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>); you dressed yourself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) eyes; you lived by his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
thoughts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was all after I was engaged. If you would accept Harry Gilmore,
you would do just the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be sure that it would be so. I am now almost sure that it
would not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why do you want to go home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) may not be pestered by having me near him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). I think it will
be better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) that I should go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is to ask you again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) will--in three months. But you should tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
that it will be better that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) should not. I would advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) to
travel,--if I were his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend, like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And leave all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) duties, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) pleasures, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) house, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
property, because of your face and figure, my dear! I don't think any
woman is worth so much to a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips in sorrow for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had said. <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own speech about himself, Janet, not of my worth. It does not
astonish you more than it does me that such a man as Mr. Gilmore
should be perplexed in spirit for such a cause. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is perplexed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is perplexed, and of course I was in joke. Only it does
seem so hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! I should like to shake you till you fell into
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms. I know it would be best for you. You will go on examining
your own feelings and doubting about your heart, and waiting for
something that will never come till you will have lost your time.
That is the way old maids are made. If you married Harry, by the time
your first child was born you would think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was Jupiter,--just
as I think that Frank is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Fenwick owned, however, that as matters stood at present, it
would be best that Mary should return home; and letters were written
that afternoon to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be at Loring by the middle of
next week.

<p/>The Vicar was not seen till dinner-time, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) came home in
considerable perplexity of spirit. It was agreed between the two
women that the fate of Harry Gilmore, as far as it had been decided,
should be told to Mr. Fenwick by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
vexed, and almost angry with Mary, promised to make the best of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>maids</b></font>)'ll lose him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) at last; that'll be the end of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) scoured his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) face with a towel after washing it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw a man so much in love in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But iron won't remain long at red heat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What she (<font color='blue'><b>maids</b></font>) says
herself would be the best for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll break up and go away for a
time, and then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes back, there'll be somebody else. She (<font color='blue'><b>maids</b></font>)'ll
live to repent it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>maids</b></font>)'s away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) there may be a change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fiddlestick!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/>Mary, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) before dinner, could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was angry
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bore it with the utmost meekness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) believed of
herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was much to blame in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not fall in love
with Harry Gilmore. Mrs. Fenwick had also asked a question or two
about Sam Brattle during the dressing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had
declined to say anything on that subject till they two should be
secluded together for the night.




<p/>CHAPTER V.

<p/>THE MILLER.


<p/>Mr. Fenwick reached Brattle's mill about two o'clock in the day.
During the whole morning, while saying comfortable words to old
women, and gently rebuking young maidens, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had been thinking of Sam
Brattle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) offences. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had not been in the parish very long,
not over five or six years, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been there long enough to see
Sam grow out of boyhood into manhood; and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) first coming to
the parish, for the first two or three years, the lad had been a
favourite with him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). Young Brattle could run well, leap well, fish
well, and do a good turn of work about his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) father's mill. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>)
could also read and write, and cast accounts, and was a clever
fellow. The parson, though he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had tried his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) hand with energy at
making the man, had, perhaps, done something towards marring him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>); and
it may be that some feeling of this was on Mr. Fenwick's conscience.
A gentleman's favourite in a country village, when of Sam Brattle's
age, is very apt to be spoiled by the kindness that is shown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>).
Sam had spent many a long afternoon fishing with the parson, but
those fishing days were now more than two years gone by. It had been
understood that Sam was to assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father at the mill; and much
good advice as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) trade the lad had received from Mr. Fenwick.
There ought to be no more fishing for the young miller, except
on special holiday occasions,--no more fishing, at least, during
the hours required for milling purposes. So Mr. Fenwick had said
frequently. Nevertheless the old miller attributed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) son's idleness
in great part to the parson's conduct, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had so told the
parson more than once. Of late Sam Brattle had certainly not been
a good son, had neglected his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) work, disobeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, and
brought trouble on a household which had much suffering to endure
independently of that which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might bring upon it.

<p/>Jacob Brattle was a man at this time over sixty-five years of age,
and every year of the time had been spent in that mill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had never
known another occupation or another home, and had very rarely slept
under another roof. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had married the daughter of a neighbouring
farmer, and had had some twelve or fourteen children. There were at
this time six still living. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) himself had ever been a hardworking,
sober, honest man. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was cross-grained, litigious, moody, and
tyrannical. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mill and about a hundred acres of adjoining
meadow land at a rent in which no account was taken either of the
building or of the mill privileges attached to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paid simply for
the land at a rate per acre, which, as both he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) landlord well
knew, would make it acceptable on the same terms to any farmer in the
parish; and neither for his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) mill, nor for his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) land, had he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) any lease,
nor had his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) father or his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) grandfather had leases before him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>). Though
he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was a clever man in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) hardly knew what a lease was.
He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) doubted whether his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) landlord could dispossess him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
paid his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) rent, but he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was not sure. But of this he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was
sure,--that were Mr. Gilmore to attempt to do such a thing, all
Wiltshire would cry out against the deed, and probably the heavens
would fall and crush the doer. He (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) was a man with an unlimited love
of justice; but the justice which he (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) loved best was justice to
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) brooded over injuries done to him (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>),--injuries real or
fancied,--till he (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) taught himself to wish that all who hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) might
be crucified for the hurt they did to him (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) never forgot, and never
wished to forgive. If any prayer came from him (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>), it was a prayer that
his (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) own heart might be so hardened that when vengeance came in his (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>)
way he (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) might take it without stint against the trespasser of the
moment. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) was not a cruel man. He (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) would almost despise
himself, because when the moment for vengeance did come, he (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) would
abstain from vengeance. He (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) would dismiss a disobedient servant with
curses which would make one's hair stand on end, and would hope
within his (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) heart of hearts that before the end of the next week the
man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and children might be in the poorhouse. When the
end of the next week came, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would send the wife meat, and would
give the children bread, and would despise himself for doing so.
In matters of religion he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an old Pagan, going to no place of
worship, saying no prayer, believing in no creed,--with some vague
idea that a supreme power would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right at last, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worked
hard, robbed no one, fed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and children, and paid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way. To
pay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way was the pride of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart; to be paid on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way was its
joy.

<p/>In that matter of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) landlord he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very bitter.
The Squire's father some fifteen years since had given to the miller
a verbal promise that the house and mill should be repaired. The old
Squire had not been a good man of business, and had gone on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
tenants very much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had found them, without looking much into the
position of each. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had, no doubt, said something that amounted
to a promise on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own account as to these repairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had died soon
after, and the repairs had not been effected. A year after his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) death
an application,--almost a demand,--was made upon our Squire by the
miller, and the miller had been wrathful even when the Squire said
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would look into it. The Squire did look into it, and came to
the conclusion that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) received no rent at all for the house and
mill, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own property would be improved if the house and
mill were made to vanish, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had no evidence whatever of any
undertaking on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father's part, as any such promise on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father's
part must simply have been a promise of a gift of money out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
own pocket, and further as the miller was impudent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would not
repair the mill. Ultimately he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) offered L20 towards the repairs, which
the miller indignantly refused. Readers will be able to imagine how
pretty a quarrel there would thus be between the landlord and his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
tenant. When all this was commencing,--at the time, that is, of the
old Squire's death,--Brattle had the name of being a substantial
person; but misfortune had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); doctors' bills had been
very heavy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) children had drained his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) resources from him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and it
was now known that it set him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) very hard to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) way. In regard to
the house and the mill, some absolutely essential repairs had been
done at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own costs; but the L20 had never been taken.

<p/>In some respects the man's fortune in life had been good. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife
was one of those loving, patient, self-denying, almost heavenly human
beings, one or two of whom may come across one's path, and who, when
found, are generally found in that sphere of life to which this woman
belonged. Among the rich there is that difficulty of the needle's
eye; among the poor there is the difficulty of the hardness of their
lives. And the miller loved this woman with a perfect love. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) hardly
knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) could be harsh to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and
tyrannical. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) could say cutting words to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But at any time in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
life he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) would have struck over the head, with his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) staff, another man
who should have said a word to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). They had lost many children;
but of the six who remained, there were four of whom they might be
proud. The eldest was a farmer, married and away, doing well in a far
part of the county, beyond Salisbury, on the borders of Hampshire.
The father in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) emergencies had almost been tempted to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son
for money; but hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had refrained. A daughter was married to
a tradesman at Warminster, and was also doing well. A second son who
had once been sickly and weak, was a scholar in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) way, and was now
a schoolmaster, also at Warminster, and in great repute with the
parson of the parish there. There was a second daughter, Fanny, at
home, a girl as good as gold, the glory and joy and mainstay of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
mother, whom even the miller could not scold,--whom all Bullhampton
loved. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a plain girl, brown, and somewhat hard-visaged;--a
morsel of fruit as sweet as any in the garden, but one that the eye
would not select for its outside grace, colour, and roundness. Then
there were the two younger. Of Sam, the youngest of all, who was now
twenty-one, something has already been said. Between him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) and Fanny
there was,--perhaps it will be better to say there had been,--another
daughter. Of all the flock Carry had been her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father's darling. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
had not been brown or hard-visaged. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was such a morsel of fruit
as men do choose, when allowed to range and pick through the whole
length of the garden wall. Fair she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been, with laughing eyes,
and floating curls; strong in health, generous in temper, though now
and again with something of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father's humour. To her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother's eye
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had never been as sweet as Fanny; but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been
as bright and beautiful as the harvest moon. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was a thing,
somewhere, never to be mentioned! Any man who would have named her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father's ears, would have encountered instantly the force of
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrath. This was so well known in Bullhampton that there was not
one who would dare to suggest to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) even that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might be saved.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother prayed for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daily, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
always. It was a great lump upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must bear to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
grave; and for which there could be no release. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not know
whether it was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart, or his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) body that suffered. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
only knew that it was there,--a load that could never be lightened.
What comfort was it to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had beaten a miscreant to
death's door--that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old hands, had nearly torn the wretch
limb from limb--that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) all but lifeless, and had walked
off scatheless, nobody daring to put a finger on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? The man had
been pieced up by some doctor, and was away in Asia, in Africa, in
America--soldiering somewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been a lieutenant in those
days, and was probably a lieutenant still. It was nothing to old
Brattle where he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) was. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) been able to drink the fellow's blood to
the last drop, it would not have lightened his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) load an ounce. He (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) knew
that it was so now. Nothing could lighten it;--not though an angel
could come and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) girl was a second Magdalen. The
Brattles had ever held up their heads. The women, at least, had
always been decent.

<p/>Jacob Brattle, himself, was a low, thickset man, with an appearance
of great strength, which was now submitting itself, very slowly, to
the hand of time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had sharp green eyes, and shaggy eyebrows, with
thin lips, and a square chin, a nose which, though its shape was
aquiline, protruded but little from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) forehead was low
and broad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was seldom seen without a flat hat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) head.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) hair and very scanty whiskers were gray; but, then too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was
gray from head to foot. The colour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) trade had so clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>),
that no one could say whether that grayish whiteness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) face came
chiefly from meal or from sorrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was a silent, sad, meditative
man, thinking always of the evil things that had been done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER VI.

<p/>BRATTLE``S MILL.


<p/>When Mr. Fenwick reached the mill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) found old Brattle sitting alone
on a fixed bench in front of the house door with a pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) mouth.
Mary Lowther was quite right in saying that the mill, in spite of its
dilapidations,--perhaps by reason of them,--was as pretty as anything
in Bullhampton. In the first place it was permeated and surrounded by
cool, bright, limpid little streams. One of them ran right through
it, as it were, passing between the dwelling-house and the mill, and
turning the wheel, which was there placed. This course was, no doubt,
artificial, and the water ran more rapidly in it than it did in the
neighbouring streamlets. There were sluice-gates, too, by which it
could be altogether expelled, or kept up to this or that height; and
it was a river absolutely under man's control, in which no water-god
could take delight. But there were other natural streams on each
side of the building, the one being the main course of the Avon,
and the other some offspring of a brooklet, which joined its parent
two hundred yards below, and fifty yards from the spot at which
the ill-used working water was received back into its mother's
idle bosom. Mill and house were thatched, and were very low. There
were garrets in the roof, but they were so shaped that they could
hardly be said to have walls to them at all, so nearly were they
contained by the sloping roof. In front of the building there ran a
road,--which after all was no more than a private lane. It crossed
the smaller stream and the mill-run by two wooden bridges; but the
river itself had been too large for the bridge-maker's efforts, and
here there was a ford, with stepping-stones for foot passengers. The
banks on every side were lined with leaning willows, which had been
pollarded over and over again, and which with their light-green wavy
heads gave the place, from a distance, the appearance of a grove.
There was a little porch in front of the house, and outside of that a
fixed seat, with a high back, on which old Brattle was sitting when
the parson accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) did not rise when Mr. Fenwick addressed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) intended no want of courtesy by not doing so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) legs at business during nearly the whole of the day, and why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) not rest his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) old limbs during the few mid-day minutes which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) allowed himself for recreation?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I should catch you idle just at this moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>said the
clergyman.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``I thought I should catch you idle just at
this moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>said the clergyman.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like enough, Muster Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller; <div class="bookquote">``I be idle at times,
no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a bad life if you did not,--and a very short one too.
It's hot walking, I can tell you, Mr. Brattle. If it goes on like
this, I shall want a little idle time myself, I fear. Is Sam here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Muster Fenwick, Sam is not here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor has been this morning, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'s not here now, if you're wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>This the old man said in a tone that seemed to signify some offence,
or at least a readiness to take offence if more were said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son. The clergyman did not sit down, but stood close over
the father, looking down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and the miller went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
pipe gazing into the clear blue sky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do want him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), Mr. Brattle.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) stopped, and there was a pause.
The miller puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) pipe, but said not a word. <div class="bookquote">``I do want him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>). I
fear, Mr. Brattle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)'s not coming to much good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was? I never said so. The lad'd have been well enough
if other folks would have let him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what you mean, Mr. Brattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I usually intend folks to know what I mean, Muster Fenwick. What's
the good o' speaking else? If nobody hadn't a meddled with the lad,
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'d been a good lad. But they did, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) ain't. That's all about
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do me a great injustice, but I'm not going to argue that with
you now. There would be no use in it. I've come to tell you I fear
that Sam was at no good last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's like enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had better tell you the truth at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was about my place with
two ruffians.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you wants to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) afore the magistrate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want nothing of the kind. I would make almost any sacrifice
rather. I had him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) yesterday night by the collar of the coat, and I
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) go free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) couldn't shake himself free o' you, Muster Fenwick, without
any letting in the matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) ain't no son of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was armed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) couldn't. But what does that matter? What does
matter is this;--that they who were with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) were thoroughly bad
fellows. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) at home last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better ax his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) mother, Muster Fenwick. The truth is, I don't
care much to be talking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) at all. It's time I was in the mill, I
believe. There's no one much to help me now, barring the hired man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) got up and passed into the mill without making the
slightest form of salutation.

<p/>Mr. Fenwick paused for a minute, looking after the old man, and then
went into the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew very well that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) treatment from the
women would be very different to that which the miller had vouchsafed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>); but on that very account it would be difficult for him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) to
make his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) communication. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) had, however, known all this before he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
came. Old Brattle would, quite of course, be silent, suspicious, and
uncivil. It had become the nature of the man to be so, and there was
no help for it. But the two women would be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--would
accept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visit as a pleasure and a privilege; and on this account
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found it to be very hard to say unpleasant words to them. But the
unpleasant words must be spoken. Neither in duty nor in kindness
could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had learned last night, and be silent on this
matter to the young man's family. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered the house, and turned
into the large kitchen or keeping-room on the left, in which the
two women were almost always to be found. This was a spacious,
square, low apartment, in which there was a long grate with
various appurtenances for boiling, roasting, and baking. It was an
old-fashioned apparatus, but Mrs. Brattle thought it to be infinitely
more commodious than any of the newer-fangled ranges which from time
to time she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been taken to see. Opposite to the fire-place there
was a small piece of carpet, without which the stone floor would
hardly have looked warm and comfortable. On the outer corner of this,
half facing the fire, and half on one side of it, was an old oak
arm-chair, made of oak throughout, but with a well-worn cushion on
the seat of it, in which it was the miller's custom to sit when the
work of the day was done. In this chair no one else would ever sit,
unless Sam would do so occasionally, in bravado, and as a protest
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father's authority. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) did so his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother would be
wretched, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sister lately had begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) to desist from the
sacrilege. Close to this was a little round deal table, on which
would be set the miller's single glass of gin and water, which would
be made to last out the process of his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) evening smoking, and the
candle, by the light of which, and with the aid of a huge pair of
tortoise-shell spectacles, his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) wife would sit and darn her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's
stockings. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) also had her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own peculiar chair in this corner, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had never accustomed herself to the luxury of arms to lean on,
and had no cushion for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own comfort. There were various dressers,
tables, and sideboards round the room, and a multiplicity of dishes,
plates, and bowls, all standing in their proper places. But though
the apartment was called a kitchen,--and, in truth, the cookery for
the family was done here,--there was behind it, opening out to the
rear, another kitchen in which there was a great boiler, and a huge
oven never now used. The necessary but unsightly doings of kitchen
life were here carried on, out of view. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), indeed, would have been
fastidious who would have hesitated, on any score of cleanliness or
niceness, to sit and eat at the long board on which the miller's
dinner was daily served, or would have found it amiss to sit at that
fire and listen to the ticking of the great mahogany-cased clock,
which stood in the corner of the room. On the other side of the broad
opening passage Mrs. Brattle had her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) parlour. Doubtless this parlour
added something to the few joys of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) life; though how it did so,
or why she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) should have rejoiced in it, it would be very difficult
to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) never entered it except for the purpose of cleaning and
dusting. But it may be presumed that it was a glory to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) to have a
room carpeted, with six horsehair chairs, and a round table, and a
horsehair sofa, and an old mirror over the fireplace, and a piece of
worsted-work done by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) daughter and framed like a picture, hanging
up on one of the walls. But there must have come from it, we should
say, more of regret than of pleasure; for when that room was first
furnished, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) own auspices, and when those horsehair chairs
were bought with a portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) own modest dowry, doubtless she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had
intended that these luxuries should be used by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) and hers. But they
never had been so used. The day for using them had never come. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
husband never, by any chance, entered the apartment. To him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) probably,
even in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) youth, it had been a woman's gewgaw, useless, but
allowable as tending to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) happiness. Now the door was never even
opened before his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eye. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last interview with Carry had been in
that room,--when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) curse upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) begone
before his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) return, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) decent threshold should be no longer
polluted by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vileness.

<p/>On this side of the house there was a cross passage, dividing the
front rooms from the back. At the end of this, looking to the front
so as to have the parlour between it and the house-door, was the
chamber in which slept Brattle and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. Here all those children
had been born who had brought upon the household so many joys and so
much sorrow. And behind, looking to the back on to the little plot of
vegetables which was called the garden,--a plot in which it seemed
that cabbages and gooseberry bushes were made to alternate,--there
was a large store-room, and the chamber in which Fanny slept,--now
alone, but which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had once shared with four sisters. Carry was the
last one that had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and now Fanny hardly dared to name the
word sister above her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) breath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could speak, indeed, of Sister Jay,
the wife of the prosperous ironmonger at Warminster; but of sisters
by their Christian names no mention was ever made.

<p/>Upstairs there were garrets, one of which was inhabited by Sam, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) chose to reside at home; and another by the red-armed country
lass, who was maid-of-all-work at Brattle Mill. When it has also been
told that below the cabbage-plot there was an orchard, stretching
down to the junction of the waters, the description of Brattle Mill
will have been made.




<p/>CHAPTER VII.

<p/>THE MILLER``S WIFE.


<p/>When Mr. Fenwick entered the kitchen, Mrs. Brattle was sitting there
alone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) daughter was away, disposing of the remnants and utensils
of the dinner-table. The old lady, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spectacles on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nose,
was sitting as usual with a stocking over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left arm. On the round
table was a great open Bible, and, lying on the Bible, were sundry
large worsted hose, which always seemed to Mr. Fenwick as though
they must have undarned themselves as quickly as they were darned.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Bible and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stockings furnished the whole of Mrs. Brattle's
occupation from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) dinner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) bed. In the morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) would
still occupy herself in matters of cookery, would peel potatoes, and
prepare apples for puddings, and would look into the pot in which
the cabbage was being boiled. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) stockings and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) Bible shared
together the afternoons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) week-days. On the Sundays there would
only be the Bible, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) would pass many hours of the day
asleep. On every other Sunday morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) still walked to church and
back,--going there always alone. There was no one now to accompany
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) husband never went,--never had gone,--to church, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) son
now had broken away from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) good practices. On alternate mornings
Fanny went, and also on every Sunday afternoon. Wet or dry, storm
or sunshine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) always went; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father, who was an old Pagan,
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) zeal. Mrs. Brattle was a slight-made old woman,
with hair almost white peering out modestly from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) clean cap,
dressed always in a brown stuff gown that never came down below her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
ankle. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) features were still pretty, small, and debonnaire, and
there was a sweetness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) eyes that no observer could overlook.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was a modest, pure, high-minded woman,--whom we will not call
a lady, because of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) position in life, and because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) darned
stockings in a kitchen. In all other respects she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) deserved the name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard your voice outside with the master,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) said, rising from
her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) chair to answer the parson's salutation, and putting down her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)
stockings first, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) spectacles upon the book, so that the
Bible was completely hidden; <div class="bookquote">``and I knew you would not go without
saying a word to the old woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe I came mostly to see you to-day, Mrs. Brattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you then? It's kind of you, I'm sure, Mr. Fenwick, this hot
weather,--and you with so many folk to mind too. Will you take an
apple, Mr. Fenwick? I don't know that we've anything else to offer,
but the quarantines are rare this year, they say;--though, no doubt,
you have them better at the Vicarage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Fenwick took a large, red apple from the dresser, and began to munch,
it, declaring that they had none such in their orchard. And then,
when the apple was finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Brattle, I'm sorry that I have something to say that will vex
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Eh, Mr. Fenwick! Bad news? <div class="bookquote">``Deed and I think there's but little good
news left to us now,--little that comes from the tongues of men. It's
bad news that is always coming here. Mr. Fenwick,--what is it, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) repeated the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had before put to the miller about
Sam. Where was Sam last night?--She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) only shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) head. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sleep
at home?--She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) head again. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) breakfasted at home?

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Deed no, sir. I haven't set eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) since before yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how does he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) live? His (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) father does not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) money, I
suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's little enough to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), Mr. Fenwick. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) is at the
mill his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) father do pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) a some'at over and above his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) keep. It
isn't much, sir. Young men must have a some'at in their pockets at
times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) has too much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) pockets, I fear. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) had nothing, so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) needs must come home for his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) meals. He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) works at the mill,
doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At times, sir; and there isn't a lad in all Bullumpton,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--for so the
name was ordinarily pronounced,--<div class="bookquote">``who can do a turn of work to beat
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father agree pretty well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At times, sir. Times again his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father don't say much to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). The
master ain't given to much talking in the mill, and Sam, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'s
there, works with a will. There's times when his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father softens down
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), and then to see 'em, you'd think they was all in all to each
other. There's a stroke of the master about Sam hisself, at times,
Mr. Fenwick, and the old man's eyes gladden to see it. There's none
so near his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) heart now as poor Sam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) were as honest a man as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father, I could forgive all the
rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick slowly, meaning to imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was not
there now to complain of church observances neglected, or of small
irregularities of life. The paganism of the old miller had often been
the subject of converse between the parson and Mrs. Brattle, it being
a matter on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had many an unhappy thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>), groping darkly
among subjects which he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) hardly dared to touch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) presence lest
he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) should seem to unteach that in private which he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) taught in public,
had subtlely striven to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) believe that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), through her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
faith, would be saved, he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>), the husband, might yet escape that doom
of everlasting fire, which to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was so stern a reality that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
thought of its fury with a shudder whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) heard of the world's
wickedness. When Parson Fenwick had first made himself intimate
at the mill Mrs. Brattle had thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) husband's habits of
life would have been to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as wormwood and gall,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would be
unable not to chide, and well she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) husband would bear no
chiding. By degrees she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had come to understand that this new parson
was one who talked more of life with its sorrows, and vices, and
chances of happiness, and possibilities of goodness, than he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) did
of the requirements of his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) religion. For herself inwardly she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had
grieved at this, and, possibly, also for him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>); but, doubtless, there
had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) some comfort, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) did not care to analyse, from
the manner in which <div class="bookquote">``the master,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>), Pagan as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) was,
had been treated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) clergyman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) wondered that it should be so,
but yet it was a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) to know that God's messenger should
come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), and yet say never a word of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) message to that hard
lord, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) so feared and so loved, and who was, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) well knew,
too stubborn to receive it. And Fenwick had spoken,--still spoke
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), so tenderly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) erring, fallen child, never calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
a castaway, talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) as Carry, who might yet be worthy of
happiness here and of all joy hereafter; that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) thought
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) as a minister of God, whose duty it was to pronounce God's
threats to erring human beings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was almost alarmed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could
hardly understand his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) leniency,--his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) abstinence from reproof; but
entertained a vague, wandering, unformed wish that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) never
opened the vials of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wrath on them, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would pour it out upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>),--on her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) who would bear it for their sake so meekly. If there was
such a wish it was certainly doomed to disappointment. At this moment
Fanny came in and curtseyed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand to the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Sam at home last night, Fan?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>asked the mother, in a sad, low
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) slept in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure?''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite sure. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) this morning as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) went out. It was about
five. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) spoke to me, and I answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) must go over to Lavington, and wouldn't be home till
nightfall. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) would find bread and cheese, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>)
took it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) comes in at all hours, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) pleases. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) was at dinner
before yesterday, but I haven't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) since. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) didn't go nigh the
mill after dinner that day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Fenwick considered how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would tell to the mother and
sister, and how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would keep back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) heart
believe that Sam Brattle had intended to enter his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) house and rob
it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) did believe that the men with whom Sam was associated
were thieves and housebreakers. If these men were prowling about
Bullhampton it was certainly his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) duty to have them arrested if
possible, and to prevent probable depredations, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) neighbours'
sake as well as for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own. Nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) be justified in neglecting
this duty with the object of saving Sam Brattle. If only he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could
entice Sam away from them, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) own hands, under the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
tongue,--there might probably be a chance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>)'ll be home to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>replied Fanny, who knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not answer
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother's word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) does, bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) come to me. Make him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) come to me! Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) that
I will do him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) no harm. God knows how truly it is my object to do him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are sure of that, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) need not be afraid that I will preach to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). I will only talk to
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), as I would to a younger brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is it that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has done, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has done nothing that I know. There;--I will tell you the whole.
I found him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) prowling about my garden at near midnight, yesterday. Had
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) been alone I should have thought nothing of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) owes
me a grudge for speaking to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father; and had I found him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) paying it
by filling his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pockets with fruit, I should only have told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that
it would be better that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should come and take it in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wasn't--stealing?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>asked the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was doing nothing; neither were the men. But they were
blackguards, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was in bad hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could not have been in
worse. I had a tussle with one of them, and I am sure the man was
hurt. That, however, has nothing to do with it. What I desire is to
get a hold of Sam, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) may be rescued from the hands of such
companions. If you can make him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) come to me, do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny promised, and so did the mother; but the promise was given in
that tone which seemed to imply that nothing should be expected from
its performance. Sam had long been deaf to the voices of the women
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) family, and, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father's anger would be hot against him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would simply go, and live where and how none of them knew. Among
such men and women as the Brattles, parental authority must needs lie
much lighter than it does with those who are wont to give much and to
receive much. What obedience does the lad owe who at eighteen goes
forth and earns his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own bread? What is it to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has not yet
reached man's estate? He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has to do a man's work, and the price of it
is his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own, in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hands, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has earned it. There is no curse
upon the poor heavier than that which comes from the early breach
of all ties of duty between fathers and their sons, and mothers and
their daughters.

<p/>Mr. Fenwick, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) passed out of the miller's house, saw Jacob
Brattle at the door of the mill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was tugging along some load,
pulling it in at the door, and prevailing against the weakness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
age by the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) energy. The parson knew that the miller saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>), but the miller took no notice,--looked rather as though he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) did
not wish to be observed,--and so the parson went on. When at home he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
postponed his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) account of what had taken place till he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) should be alone
with his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wife; but at night he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the whole story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The long and the short of it is, Master Sam will turn to
housebreaking, if somebody doesn't get hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To housebreaking, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And were they going to break in here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was. I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was so minded then. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
had shown them the way in, and they were looking about on their own
scores. Don't you frighten yourself. What with the constable and
the life-preserver, we'll be safe. I've a big dog coming, a second
Bone'm. Sam Brattle is in more danger, I fear, than the silver
forks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>But, in spite of the cheeriness of his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) speech, the Vicar was anxious,
and almost unhappy. After all that occurred in reference to himself
and to Sam Brattle,--their former intimacies, the fish they had
caught together, the rats they had killed together, the favour which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), the parson of the parish, had shown to this lad, and especially
after the evil things which had been said of himself because of this
friendship on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) part for one so much younger than himself, and
so much his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) inferior in rank,--it would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) a most grievous
misfortune should he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) be called upon to acknowledge publicly Sam
Brattle's iniquity, and more grievous still, if the necessity should
be forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) of bringing Sam to open punishment. Fenwick knew
well that diverse accusations had been made against him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) in the
parish regarding Sam. The Marquis of Trowbridge had said a word. Mr.
Puddleham had said many words. The old miller himself had growled.
Even Gilmore had expressed disapprobation. The Vicar, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) pride,
had turned a deaf ear to them all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) began to fear now that possibly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been wrong in the favours shown to Sam Brattle.




<p/>CHAPTER VIII.

<p/>THE LAST DAY.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration-RSB-

<p/>The parson's visit to the mill was on a Saturday. The next Sunday
passed by very quietly, and nothing was seen of Mr. Gilmore at the
Vicarage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was at church, and walked with the two ladies from the
porch to their garden gate, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) declined Mrs. Fenwick's invitation
to lunch, and was not seen again on that day. The parson had sent
word to Fanny Brattle during the service to stop a few minutes for
him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>), and had learned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) that Sam had not been at home last
night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had also learned, before the service that morning, that
very early on the Saturday, probably about four o'clock, two men
had passed through Paul's Hinton with a huxter's cart and a pony.
Now Paul's Hinton, or Hinton Saint Paul's as it should be properly
called, was a long straggling village, six miles from Bullhampton,
and half-way on the road to Market Lavington, to which latter place
Sam had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sister that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was going. Putting these things
together, Mr. Fenwick did not in the least doubt but the two men in
the cart were they who had been introduced to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) garden by young
Brattle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson, <div class="bookquote">``that there's a good surgeon at
Market Lavington. One of the gentlemen in that cart must have wanted
him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>), I take it.''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) thought that it might, perhaps, be worth his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
while to trot over to Lavington in the course of the week, and make
inquiries.

<p/>On the Wednesday Mary Lowther was to go back to Loring. This seemed
like a partial break-up of their establishment, both to the parson
and his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wife. Fenwick had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) mind that Mary was to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
nearest neighbour for life, and had fallen into the way of treating
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) accordingly, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) of things in the parish as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might have
done to the Squire's wife, presuming the Squire's wife to have been
on the best possible terms with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) now regarded Mary as being
almost an impostor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in and obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) confidence
under false pretences. It was true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might still come and
fill the place that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had appointed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) rather thought
that at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would do so. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
hesitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was creating an unnecessary disturbance among them.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thought, been now wooed long enough, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
wife more than once, was making an ass of herself. Mrs. Fenwick was
not quite so hard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) judgment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) also was tempted to be a
little angry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend Mary a great deal better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
loved Mr. Gilmore, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was thoroughly convinced that Mary could
not do better than accept a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) owned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked,--whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), at any rate, liked so well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not as yet rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
Therefore, although Mary was going, they were, both of them, rather
savage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/>The Monday passed by, also very quietly, and Mr. Gilmore did not come
to them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had sent a note to tell them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would walk down
on the Tuesday evening to say good-bye to Miss Lowther. Early on
the Wednesday Mr. Fenwick was to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to Westbury, whence the
railway would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) round by Chippenham and Swindon to Loring. On
the Tuesday morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was very melancholy. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) knew that it
was right to go away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) greatly regretted that it was necessary.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was angry with herself for not having better known her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own mind,
and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was quite sure that were Mr. Gilmore to repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
offer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) that moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would not accept it, nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
thought ill of herself because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would not do so. <div class="bookquote">``I do believe,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``that I shall never like any man better.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
knew well enough that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was never brought to love any man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
never ought to marry any man; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was not quite sure whether
Janet was not right in telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) had formed erroneous
notions of the sort of love she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) ought to feel for the man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>)
should resolve to accept. Perhaps it was true that that kind of
adoration which Janet entertained for her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) husband was a feeling which
came after marriage--a feeling which would spring up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) own heart
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) was the man's own wife, the mistress of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, the
mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children, the one human being for whose welfare he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
solicitous beyond that of all others. And this man did love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had no doubt about that. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was unhappy, too, because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had offended his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends, and that they thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
not treating their friend well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Janet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, as they were again sitting out on the lawn, on
that Tuesday afternoon, <div class="bookquote">``I am almost sorry that I came here at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have spent some of the happiest days of my life here, but the
visit, on the whole, has been unfortunate. I am going away in
disgrace. I feel that so acutely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense! How are you in disgrace?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fenwick and you think that I have behaved badly. I know you do,
and I feel it so strongly! I think so much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), and believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to
be so good, and so wise, and so understanding,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knows what people
should do, and should be, so well,--that I cannot doubt that I have
been wrong if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thinks so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) only wishes that you could have made up your mind to marry a most
worthy man, who is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend, and who, by marrying you, would have
fixed you close to us. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wishes it still, and so do I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks that I have been--have been mopish, and
lack-a-daisical, and--and--almost untrue. I can hear it in the tone
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, and see it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye. I can tell it from the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shakes hands with me in the morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is such a true man that I
know in a moment what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) means at all times. I am going away under
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) displeasure, and I wish I had never come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Return as Mrs. Gilmore, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) displeasure will disappear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would forgive me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would say to himself that, as
I had repented, I might be taken back to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grace; but as things are
at present he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condemns me. And so do you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you ask me, Mary, I must tell the truth. I don't think you know
your own mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose I don't, is that disgraceful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there comes a time when a girl should know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own mind. You are
giving this poor fellow an enormous deal of unnecessary trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have known my own mind so far as to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that I could not
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as I understand, Mary, you have always told him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to wait a
little longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never asked him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to wait, Janet;--never. It is he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) who says
that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will wait; and what can I answer when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) says so? All the
same I don't mean to defend myself. I do believe that I have been
wrong, and I wish that I had never come here. It sounds ungrateful,
but I do. It is so dreadful to feel that I have incurred the
displeasure of people that I love so dearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no displeasure, Mary; the word is a good deal too strong.
I wonder what you'll think of all this when the parson and his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wife
come up on future Sundays to dine with the Squire and his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) lady. I
have long since made up my mind that when afternoon service is over,
we ought to go up and be made much of at the Privets; and you're
putting all this off till I'm an old woman--for a chimera. It's about
our Sunday dinners that I'm angry. Flo, my darling, what a face you
have got. Do come and sit still for a few minutes, or you'll be in a
fever.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>While Mrs. Fenwick was wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) girl's brow, and smoothing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) ringlets, Mary walked off to the orchard by herself. There was a
broad green path which made the circuit of it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took the round
twice, pausing at the bottom to look at the spot from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
tumbled into the river. What a trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been to them all! She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
was thoroughly dissatisfied with herself; especially so because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had fallen into those very difficulties which from early years she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would avoid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
would not flirt, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would never give a right to any man--or to
any woman--to call her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a coquette; that if love and a husband came
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would take them thankfully, and that if they did not,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would go on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) path quietly, if possible, feeling no uneasiness,
and certainly showing none, because the joys of a married life did
not belong to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had gotten herself into a mess, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not tell herself that it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own fault. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
resolved again that in future she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would go right. It could not but
be that a woman could keep herself from floundering in these messes
of half-courtship,--of courtship on one side, and doubt on the
other,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would persistently adhere to some safe rule. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
rejection of Mr. Gilmore ought to have been unhesitating and certain
from the first. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sure of that now. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been guilty of
an absurdity in supposing that because the man had been in earnest,
therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been justified in keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in suspense, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own sake. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been guilty of an absurdity, and also of great
self-conceit. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could do nothing now but wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should hear
from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--and then answer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steadily. After what had passed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
could not go to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and declare that it was all over. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was coming
to-night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was nearly sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not say a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
on the subject. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did,--if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offer,--then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
speak out. It was hardly possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should do so, and therefore
the trouble which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had created must remain.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thus resolved, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was leaning over the gate looking into the
churchyard, not much observing the graves or the monuments or the
beautiful old ivy-covered tower, or thinking of the dead that were
lying there, or of the living who prayed there; but swearing to
herself that for the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would keep clear of, what
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) called, girlish messes. Like other young ladies she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had read much
poetry and many novels; but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sympathies had never been with young
ladies who could not go straight through with their love affairs,
from the beginning to the end, without flirtation of either an inward
or an outward nature. Of all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heroines, Rosalind was the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalind</b></font>)
liked the best, because from the first moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalind</b></font>) passion she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalind</b></font>) knew
herself and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalind</b></font>) was about, and loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalind</b></font>) lover right heartily.
Of all girls in prose or poetry she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalind</b></font>) declared that Rosalind was
the least of a flirt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalind</b></font>) meant to have the man, and never had a
doubt about it. But with such a one as Flora MacIvor she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) had no
patience;--a girl who did and who didn't, who would and who wouldn't,
who could and who couldn't, and who of all flirts was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) the most
nauseous! As she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) was taking herself to task, accusing herself of
being a Flora without the poetry and romance to excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>), Mr.
Fenwick came round from Farmer Trumbull's side of the church, and got
over the stile into the churchyard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Mary, is that you gazing in so intently among your brethren
that were?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) said, with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``My mind was
intent on some of my brethren that are.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Then there came a thought
across her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) made a sudden decision. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``would you mind walking up and down the churchyard with me once or
twice? I have something to say to you, and I can say it now so well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) opened the gate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I want to beg your
pardon, and to get you to forgive me. I know you have been angry with
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly angry,--but vexed. As you ask me so frankly and prettily, I
will forgive you. There is my hand upon it. All evil thoughts against
you shall go out of my head. I shall still have my wishes, but I will
not be cross with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so good, and so clearly honest. I declare I think Janet the
happiest woman that I ever heard of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come; I didn't bargain for this kind of thing when I allowed
myself to be brought in here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is so. I did not stop you for that, however, but to
acknowledge that I have been wrong, and to ask you to pardon me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will. I do. If there has been anything amiss, it shall not be
looked on again as amiss. But there has been only one thing amiss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, Mr. Fenwick, will you do this for me? Will you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that I
was foolish to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might wait? Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wait? Of course
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) should not wait. When I am gone, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) so, and beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to make
an end of it. I had not thought of it properly, or I would not have
allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to be tormented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause after this, during which they walked half the
length of the path in silence. <div class="bookquote">``No, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said, after a while; <div class="bookquote">``I
will not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, Mr. Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it will not be for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) good, or for mine, or for Janet's,
or, as I believe, for yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, it will, for the good of us all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, Mary, you do not quite understand. There is not one among
us who does not wish that you should come here and be one of us;
a real, right down Bullompton `ooman, as they say in the village.
I want you to be my wife's dearest friend, and my own nearest
neighbour. There is no man in the world whom I love as I do Harry
Gilmore, and I want you to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wife. I have said to myself and
to Janet a score of times that you certainly would be so sooner or
later. My wrath has not come from your bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) to wait, but from
your coldness in not taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) without waiting. You should remember
that we grow gray very quickly, Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Here was the old story again,--the old story as she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) had heard it from
Harry Gilmore, but told as she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) had never expected to hear it from
the lips of Frank Fenwick. It amounted to this; that even he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), Frank
Fenwick, bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) wait and try. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) had formed her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) resolution,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) was not going to be turned aside, even by Frank Fenwick; <div class="bookquote">``I
had thought that you would help me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank/Frank Fenwick</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) said, very slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I will, with all my heart, towards the keys of the store closets
of the Privets, but not a step the other way. It has to be, Mary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
is too much in earnest, and too good, and too fit for the place to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) aspires, to miss his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) object. Come, we'll go in. Mind, you
and I are one again, let it go how it may. I will own that I have
been vexed for the last two days,--have been in a humour unbecoming
your departure to-morrow. I throw all that behind me. You and I are
dear friends,--are we not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do hope so, Mr. Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There shall be no feather moulted between us. But as to operating
between you and Harry, with the view of keeping you apart, I decline
the commission. It is my assured belief that sooner or later he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will
be your husband. Now we will go up to Janet, who will begin to think
herself a Penelope, if we desert her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) much longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>Immediately after this Mary went up to dress for dinner. Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind to give way, and put on the blue ribbons which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
loved so well? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) at once, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind in that direction. It would not, perhaps, be very
maidenly, but anything would be better than suspense,--than torment
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) blue ribbons, and tried to go through
that ceremony of telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). It was quite impossible. Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to do
so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would know no happiness again in this world, or probably in
the other. To do the thing, it would be necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should lie
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came down in a simple white dress, without any ribbons, in
just the dress which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have worn had Mr. Gilmore not been
coming. At dinner they were very merry. The word of command had gone
forth from Frank that Mary was to be forgiven, and Janet of course
obeyed. The usual courtesies of society demand that there shall be
civility--almost flattering civility--from host to guest, and from
guest to host; and yet how often does it occur that in the midst
of these courtesies there is something that tells of hatred, of
ridicule, or of scorn! How often does it happen that the guest knows
that he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) is disliked, or the host knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) is a bore! In the last
two days Mary had felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not cordially a welcome guest.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt also that the reason was one against which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not
contend. Now all that, at least, was over. Frank Fenwick's manner had
never been pleasanter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) than it was on this occasion, and Janet
followed the suit which her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) lord led.

<p/>They were again on the lawn between eight and nine o'clock when Harry
Gilmore came up to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was gracious enough in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) salutation to
Mary Lowther, but no indifferent person would have thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) lover. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) talked chiefly to Fenwick, and when they went in to
tea did not take a place on the sofa beside Mary. But after a while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said something which told them all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think I've been doing to-day, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Getting your wheat down, I should hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We begin that to-morrow. I never like to be quite the earliest at
that work, or yet the latest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better be a day too early than a day too late, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind about that. I've been down with old Brattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what have you been doing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm half ashamed, and yet I fancy I'm right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said this he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) looked across to Mary Lowther, who no doubt was
watching every turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) face from the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) eye. <div class="bookquote">``I've
just been and knocked under, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that the old place shall be
put to rights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's your doing, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, injudiciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; I'm sure it is not. Mr. Gilmore would only do such a thing
as that because it is proper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about it's being proper,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm not quite sure
whether it is or not. I shall never get any interest for my money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Interest for one's money is not everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless, when one builds houses for other people to live in,
one has to look to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``People say it's the prettiest spot in the parish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>continued Mr.
Gilmore, <div class="bookquote">``and as such it shouldn't be let go to ruin.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>Janet remarked
afterwards to her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) husband that Mary Lowther had certainly declared
that it was the prettiest spot in the parish, but that, as far as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) knowledge went, nobody else had ever said so. <div class="bookquote">``And then, you see,
when I refused to spend money upon it, old Brattle had money of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
own, and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) business to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hasn't much now, I fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear not. His (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) family has been very heavy on him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) paid money
to put two of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) boys into trade who died afterwards, and then for
years he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had either doctors or undertakers about the place. So I just
went down to him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) and told him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) I would do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how did he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) take it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like a bear, as he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would hardly speak to me, but went away
into the mill, telling me that I might settle it all with his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) wife.
It's going to be done, however. I shall have the estimate next week,
and I suppose it will cost me two or three hundred pounds. The mill
is worse than the house, I take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad it is to be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary. After that Mr. Gilmore
did not in the least begrudge his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) two or three hundred pounds. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
said not a word to Mary, just pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand at parting, and left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) subject to a possibility of a reversal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sentence at the end
of the stated period.

<p/>On the next morning Mr. Fenwick drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) little open phaeton
to the station at Westbury. <div class="bookquote">``You are to come back to us, you know,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, <div class="bookquote">``and remember how anxiously I am waiting for my
Sunday dinners.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>Mary said not a word, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was driven round
in front of the church she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked up at the dear old tower, telling
herself that, in all probability, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would never see it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just one thing to say, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson, as he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) walked
up and down the platform with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at Westbury; <div class="bookquote">``you are to remember
that, whatever happens, there is always a home for you at Bullhampton
when you choose to come to it. I am not speaking of the Privets now,
but of the Vicarage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very good you are to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so are you to us. Dear friends should be good to each other.
God bless you, dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>From thence she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) way home to Loring by
herself.




<p/>CHAPTER IX.

<p/>MISS MARRABLE.


<p/>Whatever may be the fact as to the rank and proper calling of
Bullhampton, there can be no doubt that Loring is a town. There is a
market-place, and a High Street, and a Board of Health, and a Paragon
Crescent, and a Town Hall, and two different parish churches, one
called St. Peter Lowtown, and the other St. Botolph's Uphill, and
there are Uphill Street, and Lowtown Street, and various other
streets. I never heard of a mayor of Loring, but, nevertheless, there
is no doubt as to its being a town. Nor did it ever return members
to Parliament; but there was once, in one of the numerous bills that
have been proposed, an idea of grouping it with Cirencester and
Lechlade. All the world of course knows that this was never done; but
the transient rumour of it gave the Loringites an improved position,
and justified that little joke about a live dog being better than a
dead lion, with which the parson at Bullhampton regaled Miss Lowther
at the time.

<p/>All the fashion of Loring dwelt, as a matter of course, at Uphill.
Lowtown was vulgar, dirty, devoted to commercial and manufacturing
purposes, and hardly owned a single genteel private house. There was
the parsonage, indeed, which stood apart from its neighbours, inside
great tall slate-coloured gates, and which had a garden of its own.
But except the clergyman, who had no choice in the matter, nobody
who was anybody lived at Lowtown. There were three or four factories
there,--in and out of which troops of girls would be seen passing
twice a day, in their ragged, soiled, dirty mill dresses, all of
whom would come out on Sunday dressed with a magnificence that
would lead one to suppose that trade at Loring was doing very well.
Whether trade did well or ill, whether wages were high or low,
whether provisions were cheap in price, whether there were peace
or war between capital and labour, still there was the Sunday
magnificence. What a blessed thing it is for women,--and for men too
certainly,--that there should be a positive happiness to the female
sex in the possession, and in exhibiting the possession, of bright
clothing! It is almost as good for the softening of manners, and the
not permitting of them to be ferocious, as is the faithful study of
the polite arts. At Loring the manners of the mill hands, as they
were called, were upon the whole good,--which I believe was in a
great degree to be attributed to their Sunday magnificence.

<p/>The real West-end of Loring was understood by all men to lie in
Paragon Crescent, at the back of St. Botolph's Church. The whole of
this Crescent was built, now some twenty years ago, by Mrs. Fenwick's
father, who had been clever enough to see that as mills were made to
grow in the low town, houses for wealthy people to live in ought to
be made to grow in the high town. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) therefore built the Paragon,
and a certain small row of very pretty houses near the end of the
Paragon, called Balfour Place,--and had done very well, and had made
money; and now lay asleep in the vaults below St. Botolph's Church.
No inconsiderable proportion of the comfort of Bullhampton parsonage
is due to Mr. Balfour's success in that achievement of Paragon
Crescent. There were none of the family left at Loring. The widow had
gone away to live at Torquay with a sister, and the only other child,
another daughter, was married to that distinguished barrister on the
Oxford circuit, Mr. Quickenham. Mr. Quickenham and our friend the
parson were very good friends; but they did not see a great deal of
each other, Mr. Fenwick not going up very often to London, and Mr.
Quickenham being unable to use the Vicarage of Bullhampton when on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) own circuit. As for the two sisters, they had very strong ideas
about their husbands' professions; Sophia Quickenham never hesitating
to declare that one was life, and the other stagnation; and Janet
Fenwick protesting that the difference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) seemed to be almost
that between good and evil. They wrote to each other perhaps once a
quarter. But the Balfour family was in truth broken up.

<p/>Miss Marrable, Mary Lowther's aunt, lived, of course, at Uphill; but
not in the Crescent, nor yet in Balfour Place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was an old lady
with very modest means, whose brother had been rector down at St.
Peter's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had passed the greatest part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) life within
those slate-coloured gates. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) died, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), almost
exactly at the same time, found that it would be expedient that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
should take charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) niece, Mary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) removed herself up to a
small house in Botolph Lane, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could live decently on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
L300 a year. It must not be surmised that Botolph Lane was a squalid
place, vile, or dirty, or even unfashionable. It was narrow and old,
having been inhabited by decent people long before the Crescent, or
even Mr. Balfour himself, had been in existence; but it was narrow
and old, and the rents were cheap, and here Miss Marrable was able
to live, and occasionally to give tea-parties, and to provide a
comfortable home for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) niece, within the limits of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) income. Miss
Marrable was herself a lady of very good family, the late Sir Gregory
Marrable having been her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) only sister had married a
Captain Lowther, whose mother had been first cousin to the Earl of
Periwinkle; and therefore on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own account, as well as on that of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) niece, Miss Marrable thought a good deal about blood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was
one of those ladies,--now few in number,--who within their heart
of hearts conceive that money gives no title to social distinction,
let the amount of money be ever so great, and its source ever so
stainless. Rank to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was a thing quite assured and ascertained,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had no more doubt as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own right to pass out of a
room before the wife of a millionaire than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had of the right of
a millionaire to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>millionaire</b></font>) own guineas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) always addressed an
attorney by letter as Mister, raising up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) eyebrows when appealed
to on the matter, and explaining that an attorney is not an esquire.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had an idea that the son of a gentleman, if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) intended to
maintain his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rank as a gentleman, should earn his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) income as a
clergyman, or as a barrister, or as a soldier, or as a sailor. Those
were the professions intended for gentlemen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would not absolutely
say that a physician was not a gentleman, or even a surgeon; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
would never allow to physic the same absolute privileges which, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) eyes, belonged to law and the church. There might also possibly
be a doubt about the Civil Service and Civil Engineering; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had
no doubt whatever that when a man touched trade or commerce in any
way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was doing that which was not the work of a gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might
be very respectable, and it might be very necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should do
it; but brewers, bankers, and merchants, were not gentlemen, and the
world, according to Miss Marrable's theory, was going astray, because
people were forgetting their landmarks.

<p/>As to Miss Marrable herself nobody could doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was a lady;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) looked it in every inch. There were not, indeed, many inches of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was one of the smallest, daintiest, little old women
that ever were seen. But now, at seventy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was very pretty, quite
a woman to look at with pleasure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) feet and hands were exquisitely
made, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was very proud of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own grey hair of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) showed very little, but that little was always exquisitely
nice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) caps were the perfection of caps. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) green eyes were
bright and sharp, and seemed to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) knew very well how
to take care of herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) mouth, and nose, and chin, were all
well-formed, small, shapely, and concise, not straggling about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
face as do the mouths, noses, and chins of some old ladies--ay, and
of some young ladies also. Had it not been that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
teeth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would hardly have looked to be an old woman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) health
was perfect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) herself would say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had never yet known a
day's illness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) dressed with the greatest care, always wearing
silk at and after luncheon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) dressed three times a day, and in the
morning would come down in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) called a merino gown. But then,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), clothes never seemed to wear out. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) motions were so
slight and delicate, that the gloss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) dresses would remain on
them when the gowns of other women would almost have been worn to
rags. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was never seen of an afternoon or evening without gloves,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) gloves were always clean and apparently new. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) went to
church once on Sundays in winter, and twice in summer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had a
certain very short period of each day devoted to Bible reading; but
at Loring she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was not reckoned to be among the religious people.
Indeed, there were those who said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was very worldly-minded,
and that at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) time of life she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) ought to devote herself to other
books than those which were daily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) hands. Pope, Dryden, Swift,
Cowley, Fielding, Richardson, and Goldsmith, were her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) authors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
read the new novels as they came out, but always with critical
comparisons that were hostile to them. Fielding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said, described
life as it was; whereas Dickens had manufactured a kind of life that
never had existed, and never could exist. The pathos of Esmond was
very well, but Lady Castlemaine was nothing to Clarissa Harlowe. As
for poetry, Tennyson, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) said, was all sugar-candy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tennyson</b></font>) had neither
the common sense, nor the wit, nor, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) declared, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) ear the
melody of Pope. All the poets of the present century, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) declared,
if put together, could not have written the Rape of the Lock. Pretty
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) was, and small, and nice, and lady-like, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) liked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) literature rather strong. It is certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) had Smollett's
novels in a cupboard up-stairs, and it was said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) had been
found reading one of Wycherley's plays.

<p/>The strongest point in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) character was her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) contempt of money. Not
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) had any objection to it, or would at all have turned up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) nose at another hundred a year had anybody left to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) such
an accession of income; but that in real truth she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) never measured
herself by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) possessed, or others by what they possessed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>)
was as grand a lady to herself, eating her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) little bit of cold mutton,
or dining off a tiny sole, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) sat at the finest banquet
that could be spread. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) had no fear of economies, either before her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>)
two handmaids or anybody else in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) was fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) tea,
and in summer could have cream for twopence; but when cream became
dear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) saved money and had a pen`north of milk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) drank two
glasses of Marsala every day, and let it be clearly understood that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) couldn't afford sherry. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) gave a tea-party, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>)
did, perhaps, six or seven times a year, sherry was always handed
round with cake before the people went away. There were matters in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) was extravagant. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) went out herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) never took
one of the common street flies, but paid eighteen pence extra to get
a brougham from the Dragon. And when Mary Lowther,--who had only
fifty pounds a year of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) clothed herself and
provided herself with pocket-money,--was going to Bullhampton, Miss
Marrable actually proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) to take one of the maids with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>).
Mary, of course, would not hear of it, and said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should just
as soon think of taking the house; but Miss Marrable had thought
that it would, perhaps, not be well for a girl so well-born as Miss
Lowther to go out visiting without a maid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) herself very rarely
left Loring, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could not afford it; but when, two summers
back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) did go to Weston-super-Mare for a fortnight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) took one
of the girls with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>).

<p/>Miss Marrable had heard a great deal about Mr. Gilmore. Mary, indeed,
was not inclined to keep secrets from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very long
absence,--so much longer than had at first been intended,--could
hardly have been sanctioned unless some reason had been given. There
had been many letters on the subject, not only between Mary and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
aunt, but between Mrs. Fenwick and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very old friend Miss Marrable.
Of course these latter letters had spoken loudly the praises of
Mr. Gilmore, and Miss Marrable had become quite one of the Gilmore
faction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) desired that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) niece should marry; but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) should
marry a gentleman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would have infinitely preferred to see Mary
an old maid, than to hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going to give herself to any
suitor contaminated by trade. Now Mr. Gilmore's position was exactly
that which Miss Marrable regarded as being the best in England.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was a country gentleman, living on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own acres, a justice of
the peace, whose father and grandfather and great-grandfather had
occupied exactly the same position. Such a marriage for Mary would be
quite safe; and in those days one did hear so often of girls making,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not say improper marriages, but marriages which in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
eyes were not fitting! Mr. Gilmore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought, exactly filled that
position which entitled a gentleman to propose marriage to such a
lady as Mary Lowther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, I am glad to have you back again. Of course I have
been a little lonely, but I bear that kind of thing better than most
people. Thank God, my eyes are good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are looking so well, Aunt Sarah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am well. I don't know how other women get so much amiss; but God

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, it's a pity you're not a young gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so fresh and nice, aunt. I wish I could always look as you
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would Mr. Gilmore say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Gilmore, Mr. Gilmore, Mr. Gilmore! I am so weary of Mr.
Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Weary of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Weary of myself because of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)--that is what I mean. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) has behaved
always well, and I am not at all sure that I have. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is a
perfect gentleman. But I shall never be Mrs. Gilmore, Aunt Sarah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Janet says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) thinks you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Janet is mistaken. But, dear aunt, don't let us talk about it at
once. Of course you shall hear everything in time, but I have had so
much of it. Let us see what new books there are. Cast Iron! You don't

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't read it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I will, aunt. So it must not go back for a day or two. I do love

 (<font color='red'><b>X.</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER X.

<p/>CRUNCH``EM CAN``T BE HAD.


<p/>Mr. Fenwick had intended to have come home round by Market Lavington,
after having deposited Miss Lowther at the Westbury Station, with
the view of making some inquiry respecting the gentleman with the
hurt shoulder; but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had found the distance to be too great, and
had abandoned the idea. After that there was not a day to spare till
the middle of the next week; so that it was nearly a fortnight after
the little scene at the corner of the Vicarage garden wall before he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
called upon the Lavington constable and the Lavington doctor. From
the latter he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could learn nothing. No such patient had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>).
But the constable, though he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had not seen the two men, had heard
of them. One was a man who in former days had frequented Lavington,
Burrows by name, generally known as Jack the Grinder, who had been
in every prison in Wiltshire and Somersetshire, but who had not,--so
said the constable,--honoured Lavington for the last two years, till
this his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) last appearance. He (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) had, however, been seen there in company
with another man, and had evidently been in a condition very unfit
for work. He (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) had slept one night at a low public-house, and had then
moved on. The man had complained of a fall from the cart, and had
declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was black and blue all over; but it seemed to be
clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no broken bones. Mr. Fenwick therefore was all but
convinced that Jack the Grinder was the gentleman with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
had the encounter, and that the grinder's back had withstood that
swinging blow from the life-preserver. Of the Grinder's companions
nothing could be learned. The two men had taken the Devizes road
out of Lavington, and beyond that nothing was known of them. When
the parson mentioned Sam Brattle's name in a whisper, the Lavington
constable shook his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) knew all about old Jacob Brattle. A very
respectable party was old Mr. Brattle in the constable's opinion.
Nevertheless the constable shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) head when Sam Brattle's name was
mentioned. Having learned so much, the parson rode home.

<p/>Two days after this, on a Friday, Fenwick was sitting after breakfast
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) study, at work on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) sermon for next Sunday, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was told
that old Mrs. Brattle was waiting to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) immediately got up,
and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own wife and the miller's seated in the hall. It was
not often that Mrs. Brattle made her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) way to the Vicarage, but when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) did so she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was treated with great consideration. It was still
August, and the weather was very hot, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had walked up across
the water mead, and was tired. A glass of wine and a biscuit were
pressed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was encouraged to sit and say a few
indifferent words, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was taken into the study and told to
commence the story which had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) so far. And there was a
most inviting topic for conversation. The mill and the mill premises
were to be put in order by the landlord. Mrs. Brattle affected to
be rather dismayed than otherwise by the coming operations. The
mill would have lasted their time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and as for them as
were to come after them,--well! she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) didn't know. As things was now,
perhaps, it might be that after all Sam would have the mill.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But the
trouble occasioned by the workmen would be infinite. How were they to
live in the mean time, and where were they to go? It soon appeared,
however, that all this had been already arranged. Milling must of
course be stopped for a month or six weeks. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir, feyther
says that there won't be no more grinding much before winter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But the mill was to be repaired first, and then, when it became
absolutely necessary to dismantle the house, they were to endeavour
to make shift, and live in the big room of the mill itself, till
their furniture should be put back again. Mrs. Fenwick, with ready
good nature, offered to accommodate Mrs. Brattle and Fanny at the
Vicarage; but the old woman declined with many protestations of
gratitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old man yet, and would not do so
now. The weather would be mild for awhile, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought that they
could get through. By this time the glass of wine had been sipped
to the bottom, and the parson, mindful of his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) sermon, had led the
visitor into his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) study. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come to tell that Sam at last had
returned home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) up with you, Mrs. Brattle?''  (<font color='red'><b>an lady none</b></font>)</div>Here was a
question to ask of an old lady, whose dominion over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son was
absolutely none! Sam had become so frightfully independent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
hardly regarded the word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father, who was a man pre-eminently
capable of maintaining authority, and would no more do a thing
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) than because the wind whistled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I axed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) to come up, not just with me, but of hisself, Mr.
Fenwick; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said as how you would know where to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) if you
wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what I don't know. However, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'s there now I'll go to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). It would have been better far that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) should have come to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told `un so, Mr. Fenwick, I did, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not signify. I will go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>); only it cannot be to-day, as
I have promised to take my wife over to Charlicoats. But I'll come
down immediately after breakfast to-morrow. You think he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'ll be still
there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) will, Mr. Fenwick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) and feyther have taken on again,
till it's beautiful to see. There was none of 'em feyther ever loved
like he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>),--only one.''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>Thereupon the poor woman burst out into tears,
and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) handkerchief. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) never makes half so
much account of my Fan, that never had a fault belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Sam will stick to that it will be well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'s taken up extraordinary with the repairs, Mr. Fenwick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'s in
and about and over the place, looking to everything; and feyther says
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knows so much about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) b`lieves the boy could do it all out o'
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own head. There's nothing feyther ever liked so much as folks to
be strong and clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the Squire's tradesmen won't like all that. Is Mitchell
going to do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ain't a doing in that way, Mr. Fenwick. The Squire is allowing
L200, and feyther is to get it done. Mister Mitchell is to see that
it's done proper, no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now tell me, Mrs. Brattle, what has Sam been about all the time
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what I cannot tell you, Mr. Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your husband has asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) ain't told me, Mr. Fenwick. I don't care to come
between them with hints and jealousies, suspecting like. Our Fan says
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>)'s been out working somewhere Lavington way; but I don't know as

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) decent looking when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) came home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) wasn't much amiss, Mr. Fenwick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has that way with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
most always looks decent;--don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) any money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had a some'at, because when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was working, moving the big lumber
as though for bare life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) sent one of the boys for beer, and I
see'd him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) give the boy the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry for it. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'d come back without a penny, and with
hunger like a wolf in his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) stomach, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) clothes all rags,
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) might have had a taste of the suffering of a vagabond's
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just like the Prodigal Son, Mr. Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just like the Prodigal Son. He (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) would not have come back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>)
father had he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) not been driven by his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) own vices to live with the
swine.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>Then, seeing the tears coming down the poor mother's cheeks,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) added in a kinder voice, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it may be all well as it is. We
will hope so at least, and to-morrow I will come down and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>).
You need not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) that I am coming, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) should ask where
you have been.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then Mrs. Brattle took her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) leave, and the parson
finished his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) sermon.

<p/>That afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) drove his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wife across the county to visit certain
friends at Charlicoats, and, both going and coming, could not keep
himself from talking about the Brattles. In the first place, he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
thought that Gilmore was wrong not to complete the work himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>)'ll see that the money is spent and all that, and no
doubt in this way he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) may get the job done twenty or thirty pounds
cheaper; but the Brattles have not interest enough in the place to
justify it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose the old man liked it best so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The old man shouldn't have been allowed to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way. I am in an
awful state of alarm about Sam. Much as I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>),--or at any rate
did like him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>),--I fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) is going, or perhaps has gone, to the dogs.
That those two men were housebreakers is as certain as that you sit
there; and I cannot doubt but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) has been with them over at
Lavington or Devizes, or somewhere in that country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) may, perhaps, never have joined them in anything of that
kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man is known by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companions. I would not have believed it if
I had not found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the men, and traced him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and them about the
county together. You see that this fellow whom they call the Grinder
was certainly the man I struck. I tracked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to Lavington, and there
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was complaining of being sore all over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body. I don't wonder
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sore. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be made like a horse to be no worse than
sore. Well, then, that man and Sam were certainly in our garden
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a chance, Frank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I will give him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) a chance. I will give him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) the very best
chance I can. I would do anything to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>),--but I can't help
knowing what I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had made very little to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wife of the danger of the Vicarage
being robbed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could not but feel that there was danger.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wife had brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), among other plenishing for their
household, a considerable amount of handsome plate, more than is,
perhaps, generally to be found in country parsonages, and no doubt
this fact was known, at any rate, to Sam Brattle. Had the men simply
intended to rob the garden, they would not have run the risk of
coming so near to the house windows. But then it certainly was true
that Sam was not showing them the way. The parson did not quite know
what to think about it, but it was clearly his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) duty to be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
guard.

<p/>That same evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sauntered across the corner of the churchyard
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) neighbour the farmer. Looking out warily for Bone'm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) stood
leaning upon the farm gate. Bone'm was not to be seen or heard, and
therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) entered, and walked up to the back door, which indeed
was the only door for entrance or egress that was ever used. There
was a front door opening into a little ragged garden, but this was as
much a fixture as the wall. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was knocking at the back door, it
was opened by the farmer himself. Mr. Fenwick had called to inquire
whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend had secured for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>),--as half promised,--the
possession of a certain brother of Bone'm's, who was supposed to be
of a very pugnacious disposition in the silent watches of the night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no go, parson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, Mr. Trumbull?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth is, there be such a deal of talk o' thieves about the
country, that no one likes to part with such a friend as that. Muster
Crickly, over at Imber, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) have another big dog it's true, a reg`lar
mastiff, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) do say that Crunch'em be better than the mastiff, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) won't let `un go, parson,--not for love nor money. I wouldn't let
Bone'm go, I know; not for nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Then Mr. Fenwick walked back to
the Vicarage, and was half induced to think that as Crunch'em was not
to be had, it would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) duty to sit up at night, and look after
the plate box himself.




<p/>CHAPTER XI.

<p/>DON``T YOU BE AFEARD ABOUT ME.


<p/>On the following morning Mr. Fenwick walked down to the mill. There
was a path all along the river, and this was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) took. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
passed different points as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) went, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought of the trout he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
had caught there, or had wished to catch, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought also how
often Sam Brattle had been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had stood there delicately
throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) fly. In those days Sam had been very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), had
thought it to be a great thing to be allowed to fish with the parson,
and had been reasonably obedient. Now Sam would not even come up to
the Vicarage when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was asked to do so. For more than a year after
the close of those amicable relations the parson had behaved with
kindness and almost with affection to the lad. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had interceded with
the Squire when Sam was accused of poaching,--had interceded with
the old miller when Sam had given offence at home,--and had even
interceded with the constable when there was a rumour in the wind
of offences something worse than these. Then had come the occasion
on which Mr. Fenwick had told the father that unless the son would
change his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) course evil would come of it; and both father and son had
taken this amiss. The father had told the parson to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),
the parson, had led his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) son astray; and the son in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) revenge had
brought housebreakers down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) old friend's premises.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One hasn't to do it for thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) became a
little bitter while thinking of all this. <div class="bookquote">``I'll stick to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as long
as I can, if it's only for the old woman's sake,--and for the poor
girl whom we used to love.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought of a clear, sweet, young
voice that used to be so well known in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) village choir, and of the
heavy curls, which it was a delight to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to see. It had been a
pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to have such a girl as Carry Brattle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) church,
and now Carry Brattle was gone utterly, and would probably never be
seen in a church again. These Brattles had suffered much, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
would bear with them, let the task of doing so be ever so hard.

<p/>The sound of workmen was to be already heard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) drew near to
the mill. There were men there pulling the thatch off the building,
and there were carts and horses bringing laths, lime, bricks, and
timber, and taking the old rubbish away. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) crossed quickly by
the slippery stones he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) saw old Jacob Brattle standing before the
mill looking on, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) breeches pockets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was
too old to do much at such work as this,--work to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was not
accustomed--and was looking up in a sad melancholy way, as though it
were a work of destruction, and not one of reparation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have you here as smart as possible before long, Mr.
Brattle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know much about smart, Muster Fenwick. The old place was
a`most tumbling down,--but still it would have lasted out my time,
I'm thinking. If t' Squire would 'a done it fifteen years ago, I'd
'a thanked un; but I don't know what to say about it now, and this
time of year and all, just when the new grist would be coming in.
If t' Squire would 'a thought of it in June, now. But things is
contrary--a`most allays so.''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>After this speech, which was made in a
low, droning voice, bit by bit, the miller took himself off and went
into the house.

<p/>At the back of the mill, perched on an old projecting beam, in the
midst of dust and dirt, assisting with all the energy of youth in the
demolition of the roof, Mr. Fenwick saw Sam Brattle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) perceived at
once that Sam had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>); but the young man immediately averted his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
eyes and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) work. The parson did not speak at once, but
stepped over the ruins around him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) came immediately under the
beam in question. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) called to the lad, and Sam was constrained
to answer <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Fenwick, I am here;--hard at work, as you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do see it, and wish you luck with your job. Spare me ten minutes,
and come down and speak to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am in such a muck now, Mr. Fenwick, that I do wish to go on with
it, if you'll let me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Fenwick, having taken so much trouble to get at the young
man, was not going to be put off in this way. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind your muck
for a quarter of an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have come here on purpose to
find you, and I must speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Must!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Sam, looking down with a very angry lower on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--must. Don't be a fool now. You know that I do not wish to
injure you. You are not such a coward as to be afraid to speak to me.
Come down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Afeard! Who talks of being afeard? Stop a moment, Mr. Fenwick, and
I'll be with you;--not that I think it will do any good.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then slowly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) crept back along the beam and came down through the interior of
the building. <div class="bookquote">``What is it, Mr. Fenwick? Here I am. I ain't a bit
afeard of you at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you been the last fortnight, Sam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What right have you to ask me, Mr. Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have the right of old friendship, and perhaps also some right from
my remembrance of the last place in which I saw you. What has become
of that man, Burrows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What Burrows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jack the Grinder, whom I hit on the back the night I made you
prisoner. Do you think that you were doing well in being in my garden
about midnight in company with such a fellow as that,--one of the
most notorious jailbirds in the county? Do you know that I could have
had you arrested and sent to prison at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you couldn't--do nothing of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know this, Sam,--that I've no wish to do it; that nothing would
give me more pain than doing it. But you must feel that if we should
hear now of any depredation about the county, we couldn't,--I at
least could not,--help thinking of you. And I am told that there will
be depredations, Sam. Are you concerned in these matters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Sam, doggedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you disposed to tell me why you were in my garden, and why those
men were with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were down in the churchyard, and the gate was open, and so we
walked up;--that was all. If we'd meant to do anything out of the way
we shouldn't 'a come like that, nor yet at that hour. Why, it worn't
midnight, Mr. Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why was there such a man as Burrows with you? Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was fit company for you, Sam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose a chap may choose his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own company, Mr. Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) may, and go to the gallows because he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) chooses it, as you are
doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; if that's all you've got to say to me, I'll go back to my
work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop one moment, Sam. That is not quite all. I caught you the other
night where you had no business to be, and for the sake of your
father and mother, and for old recollections, I let you go. Perhaps I
was wrong, but I don't mean to hark back upon that again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a-harking back on it, ever so often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall take no further steps about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't no steps to be taken, Mr. Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I see that you intend to defy me, and therefore I am bound to
tell you that I shall keep my eye upon you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you be afeard about me, Mr. Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I hear of those fellows, Burrows and the other, being about
the place any more, I shall give the police notice that they are
associates of yours. I don't think so badly of you yet, Sam, as to
believe you would bring your father's grey hairs with sorrow to the
grave by turning thief and housebreaker; but when I hear of your
being away from home, and nobody knowing where you are, and find
that you are living without decent employment, and prowling about at
nights with robbers and cut-throats, I cannot but be afraid. Do you
know that the Squire recognised you that night as well as I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Squire ain't nothing to me, and if you've done with me now,
Mr. Fenwick, I'll go back to my work.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>So saying, Sam Brattle again
mounted up to the roof, and the parson returned discomfited to the
front of the building. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had not intended to see any of the family,
but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was crossing the little bridge, meaning to go home round
by the Privets, he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was stopped by Fanny Brattle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it will be all right now, Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl said.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``I hope it will be all right now, Mr. Fenwick,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl said.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so too, Fanny. But you and your mother should keep an eye
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) may know that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) goings and comings are noticed.
I dare say it will be all right as long as the excitement of these
changes is going on; but there is nothing so bad as that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) should be
in and out of the house at nights and not feel that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) absence is
noticed. It will be better always to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) be ever so
cross. Tell your mother I say so.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XII.

<p/>BONE``M AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) MASTER.


<p/>After leaving the mill Mr. Fenwick went up to the Squire, and, in
contradiction, as it were, of all the hard things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had said
to Sam Brattle, spoke to the miller's landlord in the lad's favour.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was hard at work now, at any rate; and seemed inclined to stick
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) work. And there had been an independence about him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) which the
parson had half liked, even while he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been offended at it. Gilmore
differed altogether from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) doing in your
garden? What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) doing hidden in Trumbull's hedge? When I see
fellows hiding in ditches at night, I don't suppose that they're
after much good.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Mr. Fenwick made some lame apology, even for these
offences. Sam had, perhaps, not really known the extent of the
iniquity of the men with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had associated, and had come up the
garden probably with a view to the fruit. The matter was discussed at
great length, and the Squire at last promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would give Sam
another chance in regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own estimation of the young man's
character.

<p/>On that same evening,--or, rather, after the evening was over, for it
was nearly twelve o'clock at night,--Fenwick walked round the garden
and the orchard with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife. There was no moon now, and the night
was very dark. They stopped for a minute at the wicket leading into
the churchyard, and it was evident to them that Bone'm, from the
farmyard at the other side of the church, had heard them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
commenced a low growl, with which the parson was by this time well
acquainted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good dog, good dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson, in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``I wish we had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) brother, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would only be tearing the maids and biting the children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Fenwick. <div class="bookquote">``I hate having a savage beast about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it would be so nice to catch a burglar and crunch him (<font color='blue'><b>burglar</b></font>). I feel
almost bloodthirsty since I hit that fellow with the life-preserver,
and find that I didn't kill him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, Frank, you're thinking about these thieves more than you
like to tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking just then, that if they were to come and take all the
silver it wouldn't do much harm. We should have to buy German plate,
and nobody would know the difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose they murdered us all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They never do that now. The profession is different from what it
used to be. They only go where they know they can find a certain
amount of spoil, and where they can get it without much danger. I
don't think housebreakers ever cut throats in these days. They're too
fond of their own.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then they both agreed that if these rumours of
housebreakings were continued, they would send away the plate some
day to be locked up in safe keeping at Salisbury. After that they
went to bed.

<p/>On the next morning, the Sunday morning, at a few minutes before
seven, the parson was awakened by his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) groom at his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) bedroom door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Roger?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For the love of God, sir, get up! They've been and murdered Mr.
Trumbull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Fenwick, who heard the tidings, screamed; and Mr. Fenwick was
out of bed and into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) trousers in half a minute. In another half
minute Mrs. Fenwick, clothed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) dressing-gown, was up-stairs
among her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) children. No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought that as soon as the poor
farmer had been despatched, the murderers would naturally pass on
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) nursery. Mr. Fenwick did not believe the tidings. If a man
be hurt in the hunting-field, it is always said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'s killed.
If the kitchen flue be on fire, it is always said that the house is
burned down. Something, however, had probably happened at Farmer
Trumbull's; and down went the parson across the garden and orchard,
and through the churchyard, as quick as his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) legs would carry him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>).
In the farmyard he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) found quite a crowd of men, including the two
constables and three or four of the leading tradesmen in the village.
The first thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) saw was the dead body of Bone'm, the dog. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
was stiff and stark, and had been poisoned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's Mr. Trumbull?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) asked, of the nearest by-stander.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laws, parson, ain't ye heard?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``They've knocked his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
skull open with a hammer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)'s as dead--as dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div><p/>Hearing this, the parson turned round, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) way into the
house. There was not a doubt about it. The farmer had been murdered
during the night, and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) money carried off. Upstairs Mr. Fenwick
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) way to the farmer's bedroom, and there lay the body. Mr.
Crittenden, the village doctor, was there; and a crowd of men, and
an old woman or two. Among the women was Trumbull's sister, the wife
of a neighbouring farmer, who, with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband, a tenant of Mr.
Gilmore's, had come over just before the arrival of Mr. Fenwick.
The body had been found on the stairs, and it was quite clear that
the farmer had fought desperately with the man or men before he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had
received the blow which despatched him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told `um how it be,--I did, I did, when he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) would 'a all that money
by `um.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>This was the explanation given by Mr. Trumbull's sister,
Mrs. Boddle.

<p/>It seemed that Trumbull had had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) possession over a hundred
and fifty pounds, of which the greater part was in gold, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) kept this in a money-box in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) bedroom. One of the two women
who lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) service,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) himself had been a widower without
children,--declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had always known that at night he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) took
the box out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) cupboard into bed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had seen it there
more than once when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) up drinks when he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was unwell.
When first interrogated, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not remember, at
that moment, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had ever told anybody; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had
never told anybody; at last, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would swear that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had never
spoken a word about it to a single soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was supposed to be a
good girl, had come of decent people, and was well known by Mr.
Fenwick, of whose congregation she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was one. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) name was Agnes Pope.
The other servant was an elderly woman, who had been in the house all
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) life, but was unfortunately deaf. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had known very well about
the money, and had always been afraid about it; had very often spoken
to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) master about it, but never a word to Agnes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) had been woken
in the night,--that was, as it turned out, about 2 A.M.,--by the
girl who slept with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and who declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had heard a great
noise, as of somebody tumbling,--a very great noise indeed, as though
there were ever so many people tumbling. For a long time, for perhaps
an hour, they had lain still, being afraid to move. Then the elder
woman had lighted a candle, and gone down from the garret in which
they slept. The first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw was the body of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) master, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) shirt, upon the stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had then called up the only other
human being who slept on the premises, a shepherd, who had lived for
thirty years with Trumbull. This man had thrown open the house, and
had gone for assistance, and had found the body of the dead dog in
the yard.

<p/>Before nine o'clock the facts, as they have been told, were known
everywhere, and the Squire was down on the spot. The man,--or, as it
was presumed, men,--had entered by the unaccustomed front door, which
was so contrived as to afford the easiest possible mode of getting
into the house; whereas, the back door, which was used by everybody,
had been bolted and barred with all care. The men must probably have
entered by the churchyard and the back gate of the farmyard, as that
had been found to be unlatched, whereas the gate leading out on to
the road had been found closed. The farmer himself had always been
very careful to close both these gates when he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) let out Bone'm before
going to bed. Poor Bone'm had been enticed to his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) death by a piece of
poisoned meat, thrown to him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) probably some considerable time before
the attack was made.

<p/>Who were the murderers? That of course was the first question. It
need hardly be said with how sad a heart Mr. Fenwick discussed this
matter with the Squire. Of course inquiry must be made of the manner
in which Sam Brattle had passed the night. Heavens! how would it be
with that poor family if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been concerned in such an affair as
this! And then there came across the parson's mind a remembrance that
Agnes Pope and Sam Brattle had been seen by him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) together, on more
Sundays than one. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) anxiety, and with much imprudence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) went
to the girl and questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For your own sake, Agnes, tell me, are you sure you never mentioned
about the money-box to--Sam Brattle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl blushed and hesitated, and then said that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was quite sure
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never had. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had ever said ten words to Sam
since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew about the box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But five words would be sufficient, Agnes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then them five words was never spoke, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. But still
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blushed, and the parson thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) manner was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
favour.

<p/>It was necessary that the parson should attend to his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) church; but the
Squire, who was a magistrate, went down with the two constables to
the mill. There they found Sam and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father, with Mrs. Brattle and
Fanny. No one went to the church from the mill on that day. The news
had reached them of the murder, and they all felt,--though no one
of them had so said to any other,--that something might in some way
connect them with the deed that had been done. Sam had hardly spoken
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had heard of Mr. Trumbull's death; though when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) saw that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father was perfectly silent, as one struck with some sudden
dread, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) bade the old man hold up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) head and fear nothing. Old
Brattle, when so addressed, seated himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) arm-chair, and
there remained without a word till the magistrate with the constables
were among them.

<p/>There were not many at church, and Mr. Fenwick made the service very
short. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could not preach the sermon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had prepared, but said
a few words on the terrible catastrophe which had occurred so near
to them. This man who was now lying within only a few yards of them,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brains knocked out, had been alive among them, strong and
in good health, yesterday evening! And there had come into their
peaceful village miscreants who had been led on from self-indulgence
to idleness, and from idleness to theft, and from theft to murder! We
all know the kind of words which the parson spoke, and the thrill of
attention with which they would be heard. Here was a man who had been
close to them, and therefore the murder came home to them all, and
filled them with an excitement which, alas! was not probably without
some feeling of pleasure. But the sermon, if sermon it could be
called, was very short; and when it was over, the parson also hurried
down to the mill.

<p/>It had already been discovered that Sam Brattle had certainly been
out during the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had himself denied this at first, saying,
that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been the last to go to bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had gone to bed
about eleven, and had not left the mill-house till late in the
morning;--but his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) sister had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) rise, and had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) body
through the gloom as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) passed beneath the window of the room in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) slept. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had not heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) return, but, when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) arose at
six, had found out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was then in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) manifested no
anger against her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gave this testimony, but acknowledged that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been out, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had wandered up to the road, and explained
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) former denial frankly,--or with well-assumed frankness,--by
saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) would, if possible, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father's and mother's
sake, have concealed the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been away,--knowing that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) absence would give rise to suspicions which would well-nigh break
their hearts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had not, however,--so he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said,--been any nearer
to Bullhampton than the point of the road opposite to the lodge of
Hampton Privets, from whence the lane turned down to the mill. What
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) been doing down there? He (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) had done nothing, but sat and smoked
on a stile by the road side. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) seen any strangers? Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>)
paused, but at last declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) had seen none, but had heard
the sound of wheels and of a pony's feet upon the road. The vehicle,
whatever it was, must have passed on towards Bullhampton just before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) reached the road. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) followed the vehicle? No;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) had thought
of doing so, but had not. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) guess who was in the vehicle? By
this time many surmises had been made aloud as to Jack the Grinder
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) companion, and it had become generally known that the
parson had encountered two such men in his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) own garden some nights
previously. Sam, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was pressed, said that the idea had come
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mind that the vehicle was the Grinder's cart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had no
knowledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said, that the man was coming to Bullhampton on that
night;--but the man had said in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hearing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would like to
strip the parson's peaches. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was asked also about Farmer Trumbull's
money. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never heard that the farmer kept money
in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) did know that the farmer was accounted to be a very
saving man,--but that was all that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as much surprised,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, as any of them at what had occurred. Had the men turned the
other way and robbed the parson he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) would have been less surprised. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
acknowledged that he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had called the parson a turn-coat and a meddling
tell-tale, in the presence of these men.

<p/>All this ended of course in Sam's arrest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had himself seen from
the first that it would be so, and had bade his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother take comfort
and hold up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It won't be for long, mother. I ain't got any
of the money, and they can't bring it nigh me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was taken away
to be locked up at Heytesbury that night, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) might be
brought before the bench of magistrates which would sit at that place
on Tuesday. Squire Gilmore for the present committed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>).

<p/>The parson remained for some time with the old man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife after
Sam was gone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) soon found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) could be of no service by
doing so. The miller himself would not speak, and Mrs. Brattle was
utterly prostrated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) husband's misery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know what to say about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife
that night. <div class="bookquote">``The suspicion is very strong; but I cannot say that
I have an opinion one way or the other.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was no sermon in
Bullhampton Church on that Sunday afternoon.




<p/>CHAPTER XIII.

<p/>CAPTAIN MARRABLE AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) FATHER.


<p/>Only that it is generally conceived that in such a history as is this
the writer of the tale should be able to make his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) points so clear
by words that no further assistance should be needed, I should be
tempted here to insert a properly illustrated pedigree tree of the
Marrable family. The Marrable family is of very old standing in
England, the first baronet having been created by James I., and there
having been Marrables,--as is well known by all attentive readers of
English history,--engaged in the Wars of the Roses, and again others
very conspicuous in the religious persecutions of the children of
Henry VIII. I do not know that they always behaved with consistency;
but they held their heads up after a fashion, and got themselves
talked of, and were people of note in the country. They were
cavaliers in the time of Charles I. and of Cromwell,--as became men
of blood and gentlemen,--but it is not recorded of them that they
sacrificed much in the cause; and when William III. became king they
submitted with a good grace to the new order of things. A certain Sir
Thomas Marrable was member for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) county in the reigns of George I.
and George II., and enjoyed a lucrative confidence with Walpole. Then
there came a blustering, roystering Sir Thomas, who, together with a
fine man and gambler as a heir, brought the property to rather a low
ebb; so that when Sir Gregory, the grandfather of our Miss Marrable,
came to the title in the early days of George III. he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was not a rich
man. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) two sons, another Sir Gregory and a General Marrable, died
long before the days of which we are writing,--Sir Gregory in 1815,
and the General in 1820. That Sir Gregory was the second of the
name,--the second at least as mentioned in these pages. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) had been
our Miss Marrable's uncle, and the General had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) father, and
the father of Mrs. Lowther,--Mary's mother. A third Sir Gregory
was reigning at the time of our story, a very old gentleman with
one single son,--a fourth Gregory. Now the residence of Sir
Gregory was at Dunripple Park, just on the borders of Warwickshire
and Worcestershire, but in the latter county. The property was
small,--for a country gentleman with a title,--not much exceeding
L3000 a year; and there was no longer any sitting in Parliament, or
keeping of race-horses, or indeed any season in town for the present
race of Marrables. The existing Sir Gregory was a very quiet man, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) son and only child, a man now about forty years of age, lived
mostly at home, and occupied himself with things of antiquity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>)
was remarkably well read in the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) own country, and it
had been understood for the last twenty years by the Antiquarian,
Archaeological, and other societies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was the projector of a new
theory about Stonehenge, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) book on the subject was almost
ready. Such were the two surviving members of the present senior
branch of the family. But Sir Gregory had two brothers,--the younger
of the two being Parson John Marrable, the present rector of St.
Peter's Lowtown and the occupier of the house within the heavy
slate-coloured gates, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) lived a bachelor life, as had done
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) cousin the late rector;--the elder being a certain
Colonel Marrable. The Colonel Marrable again had a son, who was a
Captain Walter Marrable,--and after him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) the confused reader shall be
introduced to no more of the Marrable family. The enlightened reader
will have by this time perceived that Miss Mary Lowther and Captain
Walter Marrable were second cousins; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) will also have perceived,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) has given his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) mind fully to the study, that the present Parson
John Marrable had come into the living after the death of a cousin of
the same generation as himself,--but of lower standing in the family.
It was so; and by this may be seen how little the Sir Gregory of the
present day had been able to do for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) brother, and perhaps it may
also be imagined from this that the present clergyman at Loring
Lowtown had been able to do very little for himself. Nevertheless,
he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was a kindly-hearted, good, sincere old man,--not very bright,
indeed, nor peculiarly fitted for preaching the gospel, but he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was
much liked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) kept a curate, though his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) income out of the
living was small. Now it so happened that Captain Marrable,--Walter
Marrable,--came to stay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle the parson about the same time
that Mary Lowther returned to Loring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You remember Walter, do you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Marrable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least in the world. I remember there was a Walter when I was
at Dunripple. But that was ten years ago, and boy cousins and girl
cousins never fraternise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was nearly a young man then, and you were a child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was still at school, though just leaving it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) is seven years
older than I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) is coming to stay with Parson John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't say so, aunt Sarah? What will such a man as Captain
Marrable do at Loring?''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Then aunt Sarah explained all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) knew, and perhaps suggested
more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) knew. Walter Marrable had quarrelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) father,
the Colonel,--with whom, indeed, everybody of the name of Marrable
had always been quarrelling, and who was believed by Miss Marrable to
be the very--mischief himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was a man always in debt, who had
broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wife's heart, who lived with low company and disgraced the
family, who had been more than once arrested, on whose behalf all
the family interest had been expended, so that nobody else could get
anything, and who gambled and drank and did whatever wicked things
a wicked old colonel living at Portsmouth could do. And indeed,
hitherto, Miss Marrable had entertained opinions hardly more
charitable respecting the son than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had done in regard to
the father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had disbelieved in this branch of the Marrables
altogether. Captain Marrable had lived with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father a good
deal,--at least, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had understood,--and therefore could not but
be bad. And, moreover, our Miss Sarah Marrable had, throughout her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
whole life, been somewhat estranged from the elder branches of the
family. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) father, Walter, had been,--so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) thought,--injured by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) brother Sir Gregory, and there had been some law proceedings, not
quite amicable, between her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) brother the parson, and the present Sir
Gregory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) respected Sir Gregory as the head of the family, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
never went now to Dunripple, and knew nothing of Sir Gregory's heir.
Of the present Parson John she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had thought very little before he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had
come to Loring. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) had been living there she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had found that
blood was thicker than water,--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would say,--and they two were
intimate. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) heard that Captain Marrable was coming, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had quarrelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) began to think that perhaps
it might be as well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) should allow herself to meet this new
cousin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of your cousin, Walter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>the old clergyman said to
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) nephew, one evening, after the two ladies, who had been dining at
the Rectory, had left them. It was the first occasion on which Walter
Marrable had met Mary since his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) coming to Loring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) as well as if it were yesterday, at Dunripple. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
was a little girl then, and I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) the most beautiful little
girl in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We all think her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) very beautiful still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is; as lovely as ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) can stand. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) does not seem to
have much to say for herself. I remember when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was a little girl
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) never would speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) can talk when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) pleases, Walter. But you mustn't fall
in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't, if I can help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the first place I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is as good as engaged to a fellow
with a very pretty property in Wiltshire, and in the next place she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
hasn't got--one shilling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is not much danger. I am not inclined to trouble myself about
any girl in my present mood, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had the pretty property
herself, and wasn't engaged to anybody. I suppose I shall get over it
some day, but I feel just at present as though I couldn't say a kind
word to a human being.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha! psha! that's nonsense, Walter. Take things coolly. They're
more likely to come right, and they won't be so troublesome, even if
they don't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Parson</b></font>)</div>Such was the philosophy of Parson John,--for the sake
of digesting which the captain lit a cigar, and went out to smoke it,
standing at one of the open slate-coloured gates.

<p/>It was said in the first chapter of this story that Mr. Gilmore was
one of the heroes whose deeds the story undertakes to narrate, and
a hint was perhaps expressed that of all the heroes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was the
favourite. Captain Marrable is, however, another hero, and, as such,
some word or two must be said of him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was a better-looking man,
certainly, than Mr. Gilmore, though perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) personal appearance
did not at first sight give to the observer so favourable an idea of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) character as did that of the other gentleman. Mr. Gilmore was
to be read at a glance as an honest, straightforward, well-behaved
country squire, whose word might be taken for anything, who might,
perhaps, like to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own way, but who could hardly do a cruel
or an unfair thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was just such a man to look at as a prudent
mother would select as one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might entrust her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter
with safety. Now Walter Marrable's countenance was of a very
different die. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had served in India, and the naturally dark colour
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) face had thus become very swarthy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) black hair curled round
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) head, but the curls on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) brow were becoming very thin, as
though age were already telling on them, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was four or five
years younger than Mr. Gilmore. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) eyebrows were thick and heavy,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) eyes seemed to be black. They were eyes which were used
without much motion; and when they were dead set, as they were not
unfrequently, it would seem as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) were defying those on whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) looked. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) made many afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and many who were not
afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) because of a certain ferocity which
seemed to characterise his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wore no beard beyond a heavy
black moustache, which quite covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) upper lip. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) nose was long
and straight, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) mouth large, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) chin square. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was
a handsome man. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) looked to be a tall man, though in truth he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
lacked two full inches of the normal six feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was broad across
the chest, strong on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) legs, and was altogether such a man to look
at that few would care to quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and many would think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was disposed to quarrel. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) nature he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was not quarrelsome; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was a man who certainly had received much injury. It need not be
explained at length how his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) money affairs had gone wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
should have inherited, and, indeed, did inherit, a fortune from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
mother's family, of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) father had contrived absolutely to rob
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). It was only within the last month that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had discovered that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) father had succeeded in laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) hands on certainly the bulk of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) money, and it might be upon all. Words between them had been very
bitter. The father, with a cigar between his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) teeth, had told his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son
that this was the fortune of war, that if justice had been done him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marriage, the money would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own, and that by G--
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very sorry, and couldn't say anything more. The son had called
the father a liar and a swindler,--as, indeed, was the truth, though
the son was doubtless wrong to say so to the author of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) being. The
father had threatened the son with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) horsewhip; and so they had
parted, within ten days of Walter Marrable's return from India.

<p/>Walter had written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) two uncles, asking their advice as to
saving the wreck, if anything might be saved. Sir Gregory had written
back to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was an old man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was greatly grieved at
the misunderstanding, and that Messrs. Block and Curling were the
family lawyers. Parson John invited his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nephew to come down to Loring
Lowtown. Captain Marrable went to Block and Curling, who were by no
means consolatory, and accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) uncle's invitation.

<p/>It was but three days after the first meeting between the two
cousins, that they were to be seen one evening walking together along
the banks of the Lurwell, a little river which at Loring sometimes
takes the appearance of a canal, and sometimes of a natural stream.
But it is commercial, having connection with the Kennet and Avon
navigation; and long, slow, ponderous barges, with heavy, dirty,
sleepy bargemen, and rickety, ill-used barge-horses, are common in
the neighbourhood. In parts it is very pretty, as it runs under the
chalky downs, and there are a multiplicity of locks, and the turf
of the sheep-walks comes up to the towing path; but in the close
neighbourhood of the town the canal is straight and uninteresting;
the ground is level, and there is a scattered community of small,
straight-built light-brick houses, which are in themselves so ugly
that they are incompatible with anything that is pretty in landscape.

<p/>Parson John, always so called to distinguish him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) from the late
parson, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cousin, who had been the Rev. James Marrable, had taken
occasion, on behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) nephew, to tell the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) wrong to
Miss Marrable, and by Miss Marrable it had been told to Mary. To both
these ladies the thing seemed to be so horrible,--the idea that a
father should have robbed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son,--that the stern ferocity of the
slow-moving eyes was forgiven, and they took him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to their hearts, if
not for love, at least for pity. Twenty thousand pounds ought to have
become the property of Walter Marrable, when some maternal relative
had died. It had seemed hard that the father should have none of it,
and, on the receipt in India of representations from the Colonel,
Walter had signed certain fatal papers, the effect of which was that
the father had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands on pretty nearly the whole, if not on
the whole, of the money, and had caused it to vanish. There was now a
question whether some five thousand pounds might not be saved. If so,
Walter would stay in England; if not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would exchange and go back
to India; <div class="bookquote">``or,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) said himself, <div class="bookquote">``to the Devil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of it in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The worst of it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``that I am ashamed of myself for being
so absolutely cut up about money. A man should be able to bear that
kind of thing; but this hits one all round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you bear it very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. I didn't bear it well when I called my father a
swindler. I didn't bear it well when I swore that I would put him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in
prison for robbing me. I don't bear it well now, when I think of it
every moment. But I do so hate India, and I had so absolutely made
up my mind never to return. If it hadn't been that I knew that this
fortune was to be mine, I could have saved money, hand over hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

had been used all my life to the strictest economies, perhaps I might
do so. Some men do, no doubt; but I am too old to begin it. There is
the choice of two things,--to blow my brains out, or go back.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does Sir Gregory care for me? I'll show you his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) letter to me
some day. I don't think it would be cowardly at all to get away from

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you won't do that, Captain Marrable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think what it is to know that your father is a swindler. Perhaps

offered to lend me L150, which I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) can't afford to lose, and
which I am too honest to take. But even he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hardly sees it. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) calls
it a misfortune, and I've no doubt would shake hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother

up my mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) should have half the income for life. It was
because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) should not want till I came home that I enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to do

<p/>CHAPTER XIV.

<p/>COUSINHOOD.


<p/>Mary Lowther and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) cousin had taken their walk together on Monday
evening, and on the next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) received the following letter
from Mrs. Fenwick. When it reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had as yet heard nothing
of the Bullhampton tragedy.


<p/>Vicarage, Monday, Sept. 1, 186--.

<p/>DEAREST MARY,

<p/>I suppose you will have heard before you get this of the
dreadful murder that has taken place here, and which has
so startled and horrified us, that we hardly know what we
are doing even yet. It is hard to say why a thing should
be worse because it is close, but it certainly is so. Had
it been in the next parish, or even further off in this
parish, I do not think that I should feel it so much, and
then we knew the old man so well; and then, again,--which
makes it worst of all,--we all of us are unable to get rid
of a suspicion that one whom we knew, and was liked, has
been a participator in the crime.

<p/>It seems that it must have been about two o'clock on
Sunday morning that Mr. Trumbull was killed. It was, at
any rate, between one and three. As far as they can judge,
they think that there must have been three men concerned.
You remember how we used to joke about poor Mr. Trumbull's
dog. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was poisoned first,--probably an hour before
the men got into the house. It has been discovered that
the foolish old man kept a large sum of money by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a
box, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always took this box into bed with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
The woman, who lived in the house with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), used to see it
there. No doubt the thieves had heard of this, and both
Frank and Mr. Gilmore think that the girl, Agnes Pope,
whom you will remember in the choir, told about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)
lived with Mr. Trumbull, and we all thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) a very
good girl,--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) was too fond of that young man, Sam
Brattle.

<p/>They think that the men did not mean to do the murder, but
that the old man fought so hard for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money that they
were driven to it. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body was not in the room, but on
the top of the stairs, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temple had been split open
with a blow of a hammer. The hammer lay beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and
was one belonging to the house. Mr. Gilmore says that
there was great craft in their using a weapon which they
did not bring with them. Of course they cannot be traced
by the hammer.

<p/>They got off with L150 in the box, and did not touch
anything else. Everybody feels quite sure that they knew
all about the money, and that when Mr. Gilmore saw them
that night down at the churchyard corner, they were
prowling about with a view of seeing how they could get
into the farmer's house, and not into the Vicarage. Frank
thinks that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) afterwards found them in our place,
Sam Brattle had brought them in with a kind of wild idea
of taking the fruit, but that the men, of their own
account, had come round to reconnoitre the house. They
both say that there can be no doubt about the men having
been the same. Then comes the terrible question whether
Sam Brattle, the son of that dear woman at the mill, has
been one of the murderers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been at home all the
previous day working very hard at the works,--which are
being done in obedience to your orders, my dear; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
certainly was out on the Saturday night.

<p/>It is very hard to get at any man's belief in such
matters, but, as far as I can understand them, I don't
think that either Frank or Mr. Gilmore do really believe
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was there. Frank says that it will go very
hard with him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), and Mr. Gilmore has committed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). The
magistrates are to sit to-morrow at Heytesbury, and Mr.
Gilmore will be there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) has, as you may be sure, behaved
as well as possible, and has quite altered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) manner
to the old people. I was at the mill this morning. Brattle
himself would not speak to me, but I sat for an hour
with Mrs. Brattle and Fanny. It makes it almost the more
melancholy having all the rubbish and building things
about, and yet the work stopped.

<p/>Fanny Brattle has behaved so well! It was she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) who told
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) brother had been out at night. Mr. Gilmore says
that when the question was asked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) presence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
answered it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) own quiet, simple way, without a
moment's doubt; but since that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) has never ceased to
assert her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) conviction that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) brother has had nothing to
do either with the murder or with the robbery. If it had
not been for this, Mrs. Brattle would, I think, have sunk
under the load. Fanny says the same thing constantly to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) scolds her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and bids her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tongue;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) goes on, and I think it has some effect even on
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The whole place does look such a picture of ruin! It
would break your heart to see it. And then, when one looks
at the father and mother, one remembers about that other
child, and is almost tempted to ask why such misery should
have fallen upon parents who have been honest, sober,
and industrious. Can it really be that the man is being
punished here on earth because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will not believe? When
I hinted this to Frank, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) turned upon me, and scolded
me, and told me I was measuring the Almighty God with a
foot-rule. But men were punished in the Bible because they
did not believe. Remember the Baptist's father. But I
never dare to go on with Frank on these matters.

<p/>I am so full of this affair of poor Mr. Trumbull, and so
anxious about Sam Brattle, that I cannot now write about
anything else. I can only say that no man ever behaved
with greater kindness and propriety than Harry Gilmore,
who has had to act as magistrate. Poor Fanny Brattle has
to go to Heytesbury to-morrow to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) evidence. At
first they said that they must take the father also, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is to be spared for the present.

<p/>I should tell you that Sam himself declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
got to know these men at a place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was at work,
brickmaking, near Devizes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had quarrelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
father, and had got a job there, with high wages. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) used
to be out at night with them, and acknowledges that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
joined one of them, a man named Burrows, in stealing a
brood of pea-fowl which some poulterers wanted to buy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>)
says he (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) looked on it as a joke. Then it seems he (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) had some
spite against Trumbull's dog, and that this man, Burrows,
came over here on purpose to take the dog away. This,
according to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story, is all that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows of the man;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says that on that special Saturday night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not
the least idea that Burrows was at Bullhampton, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>)
heard the sound of a certain cart on the road. I tell
you all this, as I am sure you will share our anxiety
respecting this unfortunate young man,--because of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mother and sister.

<p/>Good-bye, dearest; Frank sends ever so many loves;--and
somebody else would send them too, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) thought that I
would be the bearer. Try to think so well of Bullhampton
as to make you wish to live here.--Give my kindest love to
your aunt Sarah.

<p/>Your most affectionate friend,

<p/>JANET FENWICK.


<p/>Mary was obliged to read the letter twice before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) completely
understood it. Old Mr. Trumbull murdered! Why she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had known the old
man well, had always been in the habit of speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) either at the one gate or the other of the farmyard,--had
joked with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) about Bone'm, and had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assert his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own perfect
security against robbers not a week before the night on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
murdered! As Mrs. Fenwick had said, the truth is so much more real
when it comes from things that are near. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had so often
heard the character of Sam Brattle described,--the man who was now in
prison as a murderer! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) herself had given lessons in singing to
Agnes Pope, who was now in some sort accused of aiding the thieves.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) herself had asked Agnes whether it was not foolish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) to
be hanging about the farmyard, outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) master's premises, with
Sam Brattle. It was all brought very near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)!

<p/>Before that day was over she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) was telling the story to Captain
Marrable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had of course told it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) aunt, and they had
been discussing it the whole morning. Mr. Gilmore's name had been
mentioned to Captain Marrable, but very little more than the name.
Aunt Sarah, however, had already begun to think whether it might
not be prudent to tell cousin Walter the story of the half-formed
engagement. Mary had expressed so much sympathy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin's
wrongs, that aunt Sarah had begun to fear that that sympathy might
lead to a tenderer feeling, and aunt Sarah was by no means anxious
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) niece should fall in love with a gentleman whose chief
attraction was the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been ruined by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own father,
even though that gentleman was a Marrable himself. This danger might
possibly be lessened if Captain Marrable were made acquainted with
the Gilmore affair, and taught to understand how desirable such a
match would be for Mary. But aunt Sarah had qualms of conscience
on the subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) doubted whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had a right to tell the
story without leave from Mary; and then there was in truth no real
engagement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew indeed that Mr. Gilmore had made the offer more
than once; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew also that the offer had at any rate not
as yet been accepted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt that on Mr. Gilmore's account as
well as on Mary's she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tongue. It might indeed be
admissible to tell to a cousin that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not tell to an
indifferent young man; but, nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not bring herself
to do, even with so good an object, that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) believed to be
wrong.

<p/>That evening Mary was again walking on the towing-path beside the
river with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin Walter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) now about five times,
and there was already an intimacy between them. The idea of cousinly
intimacy to girls is undoubtedly very pleasant; and I do not know
whether it is not the fact that the better and the purer is the girl,
the sweeter and the pleasanter is the idea. In America a girl may
form a friendly intimacy with any young man she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fancies, and though
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may not be free from little jests and good-humoured joking, there
is no injury to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from such intimacy. It is her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) acknowledged right
to enjoy herself after that fashion, and to have what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) calls a
good time with young men. A dozen such intimacies do not stand in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
way when there comes some real adorer who means to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and is
able to do so. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rides with these friends, walks with them, and
corresponds with them. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) goes out to balls and picnics with them,
and afterwards lets herself in with a latchkey, while her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) papa and
mamma are a-bed and asleep, with perfect security. If there be much
to be said against the practice, there is also something to be said
for it. Girls on the other hand, on the continent of Europe, do not
dream of making friendship with any man. A cousin with them is as
much out of the question as the most perfect stranger. In strict
families, a girl is hardly allowed to go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brother; and I
have heard of mothers who thought it indiscreet that a father should
be seen alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter at a theatre. All friendships between
the sexes must, under such a social code, be looked forward to as
post-nuptial joys. Here in England there is a something betwixt the
two. The intercourse between young men and girls is free enough to
enable the latter to feel how pleasant it is to be able to forget for
awhile conventional restraints, and to acknowledge how joyous a thing
it is to indulge in social intercourse in which the simple delight of
equal mind meeting equal mind in equal talk is just enhanced by the
unconscious remembrance that boys and girls when they meet together
may learn to love. There is nothing more sweet in youth than
this, nothing more natural, nothing more fitting, nothing, indeed,
more essentially necessary for God's purposes with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) creatures.
Nevertheless, here with us, there is the restriction, and it is
seldom that a girl can allow herself the full flow of friendship with
a man who is not old enough to be her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover
as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friend. But cousinhood does allow some escape from
the hardship of this rule. Cousins are Tom, and Jack, and George,
and Dick. Cousins probably know all or most of your little family
secrets. Cousins, perhaps, have romped with you, and scolded you,
and teased you, when you were young. Cousins are almost the same as
brothers, and yet they may be lovers. There is certainly a great
relief in cousinhood.

<p/>Mary Lowther had no brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had neither brother nor sister;--had
since her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) earliest infancy hardly known any other relative save
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) aunt and old Parson John. When first she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had heard that Walter
Marrable was at Loring, the tidings gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) no pleasure whatever. It
never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to say to herself: <div class="bookquote">``Now I shall have one who
may become my friend, and be to me perhaps almost a brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>What
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had hitherto heard of Walter Marrable had not been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) favour.
Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) father she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had heard all that was bad, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had joined
the father and the son together in what few ideas she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had formed
respecting them. But now, after five interviews, Walter Marrable was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) dear cousin, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) sympathised, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was proud,
whose misfortunes were in some degree her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) misfortunes, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could very soon tell this great trouble of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) life
about Mr. Gilmore, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) were indeed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) brother. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
had learned to like his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) dark staring eyes, which now always seemed
to be fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) with something of real regard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) liked them
the better, perhaps, because there was in them so much of real
admiration; though if it were so, Mary knew nothing of such liking
herself. And now at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) bidding she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) Walter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had
addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Christian name at first, as a matter of course,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) for doing so. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not dared
to be so bold with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) do so, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was a cousin indeed. Captain Marrable was at present waiting,
not with much patience, for tidings from Block and Curling. Would
that L5000 be saved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), or must he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) again go out to India and
be heard of no more at home in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) own England? Mary was not so
impatient as the Captain, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) also was intensely interested
in the expected letters. On this day, however, their conversation
chiefly ran on the news which Mary had that morning heard from
Bullhampton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you feel sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain, <div class="bookquote">``that young Sam Brattle
was one of the murderers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, Walter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or at least one of the thieves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But both Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Gilmore think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) is innocent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not gather that from what your friend says. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) says that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
thinks that they think so. And then it is clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was hanging
about the place before with the very men who have committed the
crime; and that there was a way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might have heard and
probably had heard of the money; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was out and about that
very night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still I can't believe it. If you knew the sort of people his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) father
and mother are.''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Captain Marrable could not but reflect that, if an
honest gentleman might have a swindler for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father, an honest
miller might have a thief for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``And then if you saw the place
at which they live! I have a particular interest about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the young man, of course, must be innocent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't laugh at me, Walter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is the place so interesting to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly tell you why. The father and the mother are interesting
people, and so is the sister. And in their way they are so good! And
they have had great troubles,--very great troubles. And the place
is so cool and pretty, all surrounded by streams and old pollard
willows, with a thatched roof that comes in places nearly to the
ground; and then the sound of the mill wheel is the pleasantest sound
I know anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will hope he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is innocent, Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do so hope he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is innocent! And then my friends are so much

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is the magistrate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of fellow is he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very good sort of fellow; such a sort that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) can hardly be

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is thirty-three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With a nice estate and not married! What a chance you have left

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think, Walter, that a girl ought to wish to marry a man

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/>These cousinly walks along the banks of the Lurwell were not probably
favourable to Mr. Gilmore's hopes.




<p/>CHAPTER XV.

<p/>THE POLICE AT FAULT.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration-RSB-

<p/>The magistrates sat at Heytesbury on the Tuesday, and Sam Brattle was
remanded. An attorney thus was employed on his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) behalf by Mr. Fenwick.
The parson on the Monday evening had been down at the mill, and
had pressed strongly on the old miller the necessity of getting
some legal assistance for his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) son. At first Mr. Brattle was stern,
immovable, and almost dumb. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) sat on the bench outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) door,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) eyes fixed on the dismantled mill, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) head
wearily, as though sick and sore with the words that were being
addressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>). Mrs. Brattle the while stood in the doorway, and
listened without uttering a sound. If the parson could not prevail,
it would be quite out of the question that any word of hers should
do good. There she (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) stood, wiping the tears from her (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) eyes, looking on
wishfully, while her (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) husband did not even know that she (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was there. At
last he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seat, and hallooed to her (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Maggie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``Maggie.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) stepped forward, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulder.
<div class="bookquote">``Bring me down the purse, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be nothing of that kind wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Them gentlemen don't work for such as our boy for nothin',''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the
miller. <div class="bookquote">``Bring me the purse, mother, I say. There ar'n't much in it,
but there's a few guineas as 'll do for that, perhaps. As well pitch
'em away that way as any other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Fenwick, of course, declined to take the money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would make the
lawyer understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would be properly paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) trouble,
and that for the present would suffice. Only, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) explained, it
was expedient that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) should have the father's authority. Should
any question on the matter arise, it would be bettor for the young
man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be defended by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's aid than by that
of a stranger. <div class="bookquote">``I understand, Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man,--<div class="bookquote">``I
understand; and it's neighbourly of you. But it'd be better that
you'd just leave us alone to go out like the snuff of a candle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``I won't have you speak in that way, making out
our Sam to be guilty before ere a one else has said so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>The miller shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head again, but said nothing further, and the
parson, having received the desired authority, returned to the
Vicarage.

<p/>The attorney had been employed, and Sam had been remanded. There was
no direct evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), and nothing could be done until the
other men should be taken, for whom they were seeking. The police had
tracked the two men back to a cottage, about fifteen miles distant
from Bullhampton, in which lived an old woman, who was the mother
of the Grinder. With Mrs. Burrows they found a young woman who had
lately come to live there, and who was said in the neighbourhood to
be the Grinder's wife.

<p/>But nothing more could be learned of the Grinder than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
had been at the cottage on the Sunday morning, and had gone away,
according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) wont. The old woman swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) slept there the
whole of Saturday night, but of course the policemen had not believed
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) statement. When does any policeman ever believe anything? Of the
pony and cart the old woman declared she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew nothing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son had no
pony, and no cart, to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knowing. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on to declare that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew very little about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son, who never lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had only taken in the young woman out of charity, about
two weeks since. The mother did not for a moment pretend that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
son was an honest man, getting his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bread after an honest fashion.
The Grinder's mode of life was too well known for even a mother
to attempt to deny it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pretended that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was very honest
herself, and appealed to sundry brandy-balls and stale biscuits in
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) window, to prove that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lived after a decent, honest,
commercial fashion.

<p/>Sam was of course remanded. The head constable of the district asked
for a week more to make fresh inquiry, and expressed a very strong
opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would have the Grinder and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) friend by the heels
before the week should be over. The Heytesbury attorney made a
feeble request that Sam might be released on bail, as there was not,
according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) statement, <div class="bookquote">``the remotest shadow of a tittle of
evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>But poor Sam was sent back to gaol, and there
remained for that week. On the next Tuesday the same scene was
re-enacted. The Grinder had not been taken, and a further remand was
necessary. The face of the head constable was longer on this occasion
than it had been before, and his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) voice less confident. The Grinder,
he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) thought, must have caught one of the early Sunday trains, and
made his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) way to Birmingham. It had been ascertained that he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) had
friends at Birmingham. Another remand was asked for a week, with an
understanding that at the end of the week it should be renewed if
necessary. The policeman seemed to think that by that time, unless
the Grinder were below the sod, his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) presence above it would certainly
be proved. On this occasion the Heytesbury attorney made a very
loud demand for Sam's liberation, talking of habeas corpus, and
the injustice of carceration without evidence of guilt. But the
magistrates would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) go. <div class="bookquote">``When I'm told that the young man
was seen hiding in a ditch close to the murdered man's house, only
a few days before the murder, is that no evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mr.
Jones?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Charleys</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas Charleys, of Charlicoats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No evidence at all, Sir Thomas. If I had been found asleep in the
ditch, that would have been no evidence against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it would, very strong evidence; and I would have committed you
on it, without hesitation, Mr. Jones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jones/Jones</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jones made a spirited rejoinder to this; but it was of no use,
and poor Sam was sent back to gaol for the third time.

<p/>For the first ten days after the murder nothing was done as to the
works at the mill. The men who had been employed by Brattle ceased to
come, apparently of their own account, and everything was lying there
just in the state in which the men had left the place on the Saturday
night. There was something inexpressibly sad in this, as the old man
could not even make a pretence of going into the mill for employment,
and there was absolutely nothing to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, to
do it. When ten days were over, Gilmore came down to the mill, and
suggested that the works should be carried on and finished by him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). If
the mill were not kept at work, the old man could not live, and no
rent would be paid. At any rate, it would be better that this great
sorrow should not be allowed so to cloud everything as to turn
industry into idleness, and straitened circumstances into absolute
beggary. But the Squire found it very difficult to deal with the
miller. At first old Brattle would neither give nor withhold his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
consent. When told by the Squire that the property could not be left
in that way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) expressed himself willing to go out into the road,
and lay himself down and die there;--but not until the term of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
holding was legally brought to a close. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I owe
any rent over and beyond this Michaelmas as is coming, and there's
the hay on the ground yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>Gilmore, who was very patient, assured
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had no wish to allude to rent; that there should be no
question of rent even when the day came, if at that time money was
scarce. But would it not be better that the mill, at least, should be
put in order?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed it will, Squire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Brattle. <div class="bookquote">``It is the idleness that
is killing him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your jabbering tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, turning round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``Who asked you? I will see to it myself, Squire, to-morrow
or next day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>After two or three further days of inaction at the mill the Squire
came again, bringing the parson with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); and they did manage to
arrange between them that the repairs should be at once continued.
The mill should be completed; but the house should be left till next
summer. As to Brattle himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been once persuaded to
yield the point, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not care how much they pulled down, or how
much they built up. <div class="bookquote">``Do it as you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I ain't nobody
now. The women drives me about my own house as if I hadn't a`most no
business there.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so the hammers and trowels were heard again; and
old Brattle would sit perfectly silent, gazing at the men as they
worked. Once, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) saw two men and a boy shifting a ladder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
turned round, with a little chuckle to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Sam'd 'a
see'd hisself d--d, afore he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'d 'a asked another chap to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
with such a job as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mrs. Brattle told Mrs. Fenwick afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had one of the two
erring children in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thoughts morning, noon, and night. <div class="bookquote">``When I
tell `un of George,'' (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>--who was the farmer near Fordingbridge,--<div class="bookquote">``and of
Mrs. Jay,'' (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>--who was the ironmonger's wife at Warminster,--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) won't
take any comfort in them,''  (<font color='red'><b>ironmonger wife</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Brattle. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) cares
for them, just because they can hold their own heads up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At the end of three weeks the Grinder was still missing; and others
besides Mr. Jones, the attorney, were beginning to say that Sam
Brattle should be let out of prison. Mr. Fenwick was clearly of
opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) should not be detained, if bail could be forthcoming.
The Squire was more cautious, and said that it might well be that his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
escape would render it impossible for the police even to get on the
track of the real murderers. <div class="bookquote">``No doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) knows more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) has
told,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore, <div class="bookquote">``and will probably tell it at last. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) be let
out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) will tell nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>The police were all of opinion that Sam
had been present at the murder, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) should be kept in custody
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was tried. They were very sharp in their manoeuvres to get
evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) boot, they had said, fitted a footstep
which had been found in the mud in the farm-yard. The measure had
been taken on the Sunday. That was evidence. Then they examined
Agnes Pope over and over again, and extracted from the poor girl an
admission that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loved Sam better than anything in the whole wide
world. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) were to be in prison, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not object to go to
prison with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) were to be hung, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would wish to be hung
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had no secret she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). But, as a matter
of fact,--so she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) swore over and over again,--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
a word about old Trumbull's box. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had ever told
any one; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would swear on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) death-bed that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never told
Sam Brattle. The head constable declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had never met a
more stubborn or a more artful young woman. Sir Thomas Charleys was
clearly of opinion that no bail should be accepted. Another week
of remand was granted with the understanding that, if nothing of
importance was elicited by that time, and if neither of the other two
suspected men were then in custody, Sam should be allowed to go at
large upon bail--a good, substantial bail, himself in L400, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
bailsmen in L200 each.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who'll be his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) bailsmen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Gilmore</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, coming away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
friend the parson from Heytesbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be no difficulty about that, I should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But who will they be,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father for one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) brother George, and Jay, at Warminster, who married his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sister,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt them both,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sha'n't want for bail. I'll be one myself, sooner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) shall have
bail. If there's any difficulty, Jones shall bail him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>); and I'll see
Jones safe through it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) sha'n't be persecuted in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think anybody has attempted to persecute him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), Frank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will be persecuted if his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own brothers won't come forward to help
him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>). It isn't that they have looked into the matter, and that they
think him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) guilty; but that they go just the way they're told to go,
like sheep. The more I think of it, the more I feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had
nothing to do with the murder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never knew a man change his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opinion so often as you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said
Gilmore.

<p/>During three weeks the visits made by Head Constable Toffy to the
cottage in which Mrs. Burrows lived were much more frequent than
were agreeable to that lady. This cottage was about four miles from
Devizes, and on the edge of a common, about half a mile from the
high road which leads from that town to Marlborough. There is, or
was a year or two back, a considerable extent of unenclosed land
thereabouts, and on a spot called Pycroft Common there was a small
collection of cottages, sufficient to constitute a hamlet of the
smallest class. There was no house there of greater pretensions than
the very small beershop which provided for the conviviality of the
Pycroftians; and of other shops there was none, save a baker's, the
owner of which seldom had much bread to sell, and the establishment
for brandy-balls, which was kept by Mrs. Burrows. The inhabitants
were chiefly labouring men, some of whom were in summer employed in
brick making; and there was an idea abroad that Pycroft generally was
not sustained by regular labour and sober industry. Rents, however,
were paid for the cottages, or the cottagers would have been turned
adrift; and Mrs. Burrows had lived in hers for five or six years, and
was noted in the neighbourhood for her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) outward neatness and attention
to decency. In the summer there were always half-a-dozen large
sunflowers in the patch of ground called a garden, and there was a
rose-tree, and a bush of honeysuckle over the door, and an alder
stump in a corner, which would still put out leaves and bear berries.
When Head Constable Toffy visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) there would be generally a few
high words, for Mrs. Burrows was by no means unwilling to let it be
known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) objected to morning calls from Mr. Toffy.

<p/>It has been already said that at this time Mrs. Burrows did not live
alone. Residing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) was a young woman, who was believed by Mr.
Toffy to be the wife of Richard Burrows, alias the Grinder. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>)
first visit to Pycroft no doubt, Mr. Toffy was mainly anxious to
ascertain whether anything was known by the old woman as to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son's
whereabouts, but the second, third, and fourth visits were made
rather to the younger than to the older woman. Toffy had probably
learned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) wide experience that a man of the Grinder's nature
will generally place more reliance on a young woman than on an old;
and that the young woman will, nevertheless, be more likely to betray
confidence than the older,--partly from indiscretion, and partly,
alas! from treachery. But, if the presumed Mrs. Burrows, junior, knew
aught of the Grinder's present doings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) was neither indiscreet nor
treacherous. Mr. Toffy could get nothing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) was sickly,
weak, sullen, and silent. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) didn't think it was her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) business to
say where she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had been living before she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came to Pycroft. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hadn't
been living with any husband, and had got no husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) knew
of. If she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wasn't going to say so. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hadn't any children,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) didn't know what business he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came from
Lunnun. At any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came from there last, and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) didn't know
what business he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came from. What business
was it of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to be asking what her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) name was? Her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) name was Anne
Burrows, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) liked to call her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) so. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wouldn't answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) any more
questions. No; she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wouldn't say what her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) name was before she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was
married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Toffy/Mr. Toffy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Toffy had his (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) reasons for interrogating this poor woman, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>)
did not for a while let any one know what those reasons were. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>)
could not, however, obtain more information than what is contained in
the answers above given, which were, for the most part, true. Neither
the mother nor the younger woman knew where was to be found, at the
present moment, that hero of adventure who was called the Grinder,
and all the police of Wiltshire began to fear that they were about to
be outwitted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never were at Bullhampton with your husband, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Toffy/Mr. Toffy</b></font>)</div>asked
Mr. Toffy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Grinder wife</b></font>)</div>said the supposed Grinder's wife; <div class="bookquote">``but what does it matter
to you where I was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Grinder wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't answer him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) never another word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Burrows/Burrows</b></font>)</div>said old Mrs. Burrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you ever at Bullhampton at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Toffy/Mr. Toffy</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Toffy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, oh dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the younger woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you must have been there once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Toffy/Mr. Toffy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Toffy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What business is it of yourn?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Burrows/Burrows</b></font>)</div>demanded Mrs. Burrows, senior. <div class="bookquote">``Drat
you; get out of this. You ain't no right here, and you shan't stay
here. If you ain't out of this, I'll brain yer. I don't care for
perlice nor anything. We ain't done nothing. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did smash the
gen`leman's head, we didn't do it; neither she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) nor me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same, I think that Mrs. Burrows has been at Bullhampton,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div>said the policeman.

<p/>Not another word after this was said by Mrs. Burrows, junior,
so called, and constable Toffy soon took his (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) departure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) was
convinced, at any rate, of this;--that wherever the murderers might
be, the man or men who had joined Sam Brattle in the murder,--for
of Sam's guilt he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was quite convinced,--neither the mother, nor
the so-called wife knew of their whereabouts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) heart,
condemned the constabulary of Warwickshire, of Gloucestershire, of
Worcestershire, and of Somersetshire, because the Grinder was not
taken. Especially he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) condemned the constabulary of Warwickshire,
feeling almost sure that the Grinder was in Birmingham. If the
constabulary in those counties would only do their duty as they in
Wiltshire did theirs, the Grinder and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) associates would soon be
taken. But by him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) nothing further could be learned, and Mr. Toffy
left Pycroft Common with a heavy heart.




<p/>CHAPTER XVI.

<p/>MISS LOWTHER ASKS FOR ADVICE.


<p/>All these searchings for the murderers of Mr. Trumbull, and these
remandings of Sam Brattle, took place in the month of September,
and during that same month the energy of other men of law was very
keenly at work on a widely different subject. Could Messrs. Block and
Curling assure Captain Marrable that a portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) inheritance
would be saved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), or had that graceless father of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in very
truth seized upon it all? There was no shadow of doubt but that if
aught was spared, it had not been spared through any delicacy on the
part of the Colonel. The Colonel had gone to work, paying creditors
who were clamorous against him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hand
upon the money, and had gone to work also gambling, and had made
assignments of money, and done his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) very best to spend the whole. But
there was a question whether a certain sum of L5000, which seemed
to have got into the hands of a certain lady who protested that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
wanted it very badly, might not be saved. Messrs. Block and Curling
thought that it might, but were by no means certain. It probably
might be done, if the Captain would consent to bring the matter
before a jury; in which case the whole story of the father's iniquity
must, of course, be proved. Or it might be that by threatening to
do this, the lady's friends would relax their grasp on receiving a
certain present out of the money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We would offer them L50, and perhaps they would take L500,''  (<font color='red'><b>Messrs. Block/Block</b></font>)</div>said
Messrs. Block and Curling.

<p/>All this irritated the Captain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was intensely averse to any law
proceedings by which the story should be made public.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't pretend that it is on my father's account,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) uncle. Parson John shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shoulders, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head,
meaning to imply that it certainly was a bad case, but that as
Colonel Marrable was a Marrable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) ought to be spared, if possible.
<div class="bookquote">``It is on my own account,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>continued the Captain, <div class="bookquote">``and partly,
perhaps, on that of the family. I would endure anything rather than
have the filth of the transaction flooded through the newspapers. I
should never be able to join my mess again if I did that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you'd better let Block and Curling compromise and get what they
can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parson John/John/Parson</b></font>)</div>said Parson John, with an indifferent and provoking tone, which
clearly indicated that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would regard the matter when so settled as
one arranged amicably and pleasantly between all the parties. His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
uncle's calmness and absence of horror at the thing that had been
done was very grievous to Captain Marrable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Wat!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>the parson had once said, speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wicked brother;
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never could keep two shillings together. It's ever so long since
I had to determine that nothing on earth should induce me to let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
have half-a-crown. I must say that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not take it amiss when I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) have wanted half-a-crown from you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was always one of those thirsty sandbags that swallow small drops
and large alike. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) got L10,000 out of poor Gregory about the time
that you were born, and Gregory is fretting about it yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What kills me is the disgrace of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be disagreeable to have it in the newspapers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parson John/John/Parson</b></font>)</div>said Parson
John. <div class="bookquote">``And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was such a pleasant fellow, and so handsome. I
always enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) society when once I had buttoned up my breeches'
pocket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this man</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet this man was a clergyman, preaching honesty and moral conduct,
and living fairly well up to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) preaching, too, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) himself
was concerned! The Captain almost thought that the earth and skies
should be brought together, and the clouds clap with thunder, and
the mountains be riven in twain at the very mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father's
wickedness. But then sins committed against oneself are so much more
sinful than any other sins.

<p/>The Captain had much more sympathetic listeners in Uphill Lane; not
that either of the ladies there spoke severely against his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father,
but that they entered more cordially into his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) own distresses. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
could save even L4500 out of the wreck, the interest on the money
would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to live at home in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) regiment. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could get
L4000 he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would do it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With L150 per annum,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I could just hold my head up and get
along. I should have to give up all manner of things; but I would
never cry about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would declare that the one thing necessary for his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
happiness was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) should get the whole business of the money off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``If I could have it settled, and have done with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I should be at ease.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``My idea about money is
this, that whether you have much or little, you should make your
arrangements so that it be no matter of thought to you. Your money
should be just like counters at a round game with children, and
should mean nothing. It comes to that when you once get things on a
proper footing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies intimacy</b></font>)</div><p/>They thus became very intimate, the two ladies in Uphill Lane and the
Captain from his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) uncle's parsonage in the Lowtown; and the intimacy
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) part was quite as strong with the younger as with the elder
relative,--quite as strong, and no doubt more pleasant. They walked
together constantly, as cousins may walk, and they discussed every
turn that took place in the correspondence with Messrs. Block and
Curling. Captain Marrable had come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) uncle's house for a week or
ten days, but had been pressed to remain on till this business should
be concluded. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) leave of absence lasted till the end of November,
and might be prolonged if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) intended to return to India. <div class="bookquote">``Stay here
till the end of November,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parson John/John/Parson</b></font>)</div>said Parson John. <div class="bookquote">``What's the use of
spending your money at a London hotel? Only don't fall in love with
cousin Mary.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>So the Captain did stay, obeying one half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
uncle's advice, and promising obedience to the other half.

<p/>Aunt Sarah also had her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) fears about the falling in love, and spoke a
prudent word to Mary. <div class="bookquote">``Mary, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you and Walter are as
loving as turtle doves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, boldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I, my dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) is a gentleman, and clever, and, upon the
whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) bears a great injury well. I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). But I don't think
people ought to fall in love when there is a strong reason against
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not, if they can help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw! That's missish nonsense, Mary, and you know it. If a girl
were to tell me she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fell in love because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) couldn't help it, I
should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wasn't worth any man's love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what's your reason, Aunt Sarah?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it wouldn't suit Mr. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not bound to suit Mr. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that. And then, too, it would not suit Walter
himself. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) marry a wife when he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) has just been robbed of
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) fortune?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have not the slightest idea of falling in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). In
spite of what I said, I do hope that I can help it. And then I feel
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) just as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) were my brother. I've got almost to know
what it would be to have a brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lowther/MISS LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>In this Miss Lowther was probably wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had now known her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
cousin for just a month. A month is quite long enough to realise the
pleasure of a new lover, but it may be doubted whether the intimacy
of a brother does not take a very much longer period for its
creation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think if I were you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Marrable, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``that I
would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) about Mr. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you, Aunt Sarah?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I would. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) were really your brother you would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div><p/>It was probably the case, that when Miss Marrable gave this
advice, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) opinion of Mr. Gilmore's success was greater than the
circumstances warranted. Though there had been much said between the
aunt and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) niece about Mr. Gilmore and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) offers, Mary had never
been able quite to explain her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own thoughts and feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) herself
did not believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could be brought to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and was
now stronger in that opinion than ever. But were she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to say so in
language that would convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt would no doubt ask
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), why then had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) left the man in doubt? Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew that
at every moment in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been called upon to act, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
struggled to do right, yet there hung over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a half-conviction that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been weak, and almost selfish. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dearest friends wrote to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would certainly take Mr. Gilmore
at last. Janet Fenwick wrote of it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) letters as of a thing
almost fixed; and Aunt Sarah certainly lived as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) expected
it. And yet Mary was very nearly sure that it could not be so. Would
it not be better that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should write to Mr. Gilmore at once,
and not wait till the expiration of the weary six months which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
had specified as the time at the end of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) might renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
proposals? Had Aunt Sarah known all this,--had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) been aware how
very near Mary was to the writing of such a letter,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would
not probably have suggested that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) niece should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin
anything about Mr. Gilmore. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did think that the telling of the
tale would make Cousin Walter understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) should not allow
himself to become an interloper; but the tale, if told as Mary would
tell it, might have a very different effect.

<p/>Nevertheless Mary thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would tell it. It would be so nice
to consult a brother! It would be so pleasant to discuss the matter
with some one that would sympathise with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),--with some one who
would not wish to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) into Mr. Gilmore's arms simply because
Mr. Gilmore was an excellent gentleman, with a snug property! Even
from Janet Fenwick, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) loved dearly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had never succeeded
in getting the sort of sympathy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wanted. Janet was the best
friend in the world,--was actuated in this matter simply by a desire
to do a good turn to two people whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) loved. But there was no
sympathy between her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) and Mary in the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet/Janet Fenwick/JANET FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Janet, <div class="bookquote">``and you will adore him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Janet/Janet Fenwick/JANET FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to adore him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would tell Walter Marrable what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
position. They were again down on the banks of the Lurwell, sitting
together on a slope which had been made to support some hundred yards
of a canal, where the river itself rippled down a slightly rapid
fall. They were seated between the canal and the river, with their
feet towards the latter, and Walter Marrable was just lighting a
cigar. It was very easy to bring the conversation round to the
affairs of Bullhampton, as Sam was still in prison, and Janet's
letters were full of the mystery which shrouded the murder of Mr.
Trumbull.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have something to tell you about Mr.

complete the lighting of the edges in the wind.

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>After this Captain Marrable, who had been looking her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) full in the
face while he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been asking these questions, turned somewhat
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), as though the conversation were over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) remained
motionless, and was minded so to remain till he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) that
it was time to move, that they might return home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
no advice; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) presumed she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was to take what had passed as the
expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) opinion that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) duty to accept an offer so
favourable and so satisfactory to the family. At any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would
say nothing more on the subject till he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) should address her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). Though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) dearly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) cousin, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was, in some slight
degree, afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was not sure but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was
expressing towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), by his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) anger, some amount of displeasure
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) weakness and inconsistency. After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) turned round
suddenly, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) by the hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mary!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Walter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean to do, after all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What ought I to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What ought you to do? You know what you ought to do. Would you marry
a man for whom you have no more regard than you have for this stick,
simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is persistent in asking you? No more than you have
for this stick, Mary. What sort of a feeling must it be, when you say
that you would willingly see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) married to any other girl to-morrow?
Can that be love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never loved any one better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And never will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I say? It seems to me that I haven't got the feeling that
other girls have. I want some one to love me;--I do. I own that. I
want to be first with some one; but I have never found the one yet
that I cared for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better wait till you find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), raising himself up
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``Come, let us get up and go home. You have asked me for
my advice, and I have given it you. Do not throw yourself away upon
a man because other people ask you, and because you think you might
as well oblige them and oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If you do, you will soon live to
repent it. What would you do, if after marrying this man you found
there was some one you could love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think it would come to that, Walter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you tell? How can you prevent its coming to that, except
by loving the man you do marry? You don't care two straws for Mr.
Gilmore; and I cannot understand how you can have the courage to
think of becoming his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wife. Let us go home. You have asked my advice,
and you've got it. If you do not take it, I will endeavour to forget
that I gave it you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would take it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) so then; but, of
course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) should guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). With how much more accuracy, with how
much more delicacy of feeling had he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) position, than
had her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) other friends! He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had sympathised with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) at a word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) sternly, severely, almost cruelly. But it was thus that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had longed to be spoken to by some one who would care enough for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), would take sufficient interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), to be at the trouble so
to advise her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) as a brother, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) words should
be sweet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), were they ever so severe.

<p/>They walked together home in silence, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) very manner was stern
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>); but it might be just thus that a loving brother would carry
himself who had counselled his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister wisely, and had not as yet been
assured that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) counsel would be taken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, as they neared the town, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you have no
doubt about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubt about what, Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite a matter of course that I shall do as you tell me.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVII.

<p/>THE MARQUIS OF TROWBRIDGE.


<p/>By the end of September it had come to be pretty well understood that
Sam Brattle must be allowed to go out of prison, unless something
in the shape of fresh evidence should be brought up on the next
Tuesday. There had arisen a very strong feeling in the county on
the subject;--a Brattle feeling, and an anti-Brattle feeling. It
might have been called a Bullhampton feeling and an anti-Bullhampton
feeling, were it not that the biggest man concerned in Bullhampton,
with certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hangers-on and dependents, were very clearly of
opinion that Sam Brattle had committed the murder, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) should
be kept in prison till the period for hanging him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) might come round.
This very big person was the Marquis of Trowbridge, under whom poor
Farmer Trumbull had held his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) land, and who now seemed to think that
a murder committed on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) tenants was almost as bad as insult
to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) felt personally angry with Bullhampton, had ideas
of stopping his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) charities to the parish, and did resolve, then and
there, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) would have nothing to do with a subscription for the
repair of the church, at any rate for the next three years. In making
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) mind on which subject he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was, perhaps, a little influenced by
the opinions and narratives of Mr. Puddleham, the Methodist minister
in the village.

<p/>It was not only that Mr. Trumbull had been murdered. So great and
wise a man as Lord Trowbridge would, no doubt, know very well, that
in a free country, such as England, a man could not be specially
protected from the hands of murderers, or others, by the fact of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being the tenant, or dependent,--by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being in some sort
the possession of a great nobleman. The Marquis's people were all
expected to vote for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) candidates, and would soon have ceased to be
the Marquis's people had they failed to do so. They were constrained,
also in many respects, by the terms of their very short leases. They
could not kill a head of game on their farms. They could not sell
their own hay off the land, nor, indeed, any produce other than their
corn or cattle. They were compelled to crop their land in certain
rotation; and could take no other lands than those held under the
Marquis without his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) leave. In return for all this, they became the
Marquis's people. Each tenant shook hands with the Marquis perhaps
once in three years; and twice a year was allowed to get drunk at the
Marquis's expense--if such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) taste--provided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had paid
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) rent. If the duties were heavy, the privileges were great. So
the Marquis himself felt; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) knew that a mantle of security, of
a certain thickness, was spread upon the shoulders of each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
people by reason of the tenure which bound them together. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did
not conceive that this mantle would be proof against the bullet of
the ordinary assassin, or the hammer of the outside ruffian. But here
the case was very different. The hammer had been the hammer of no
outside ruffian. To the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) lordship's belief,--and in that
belief he (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) was supported by the constabulary of the whole county,--the
hammer had been wielded by a man of Bullhampton,--had been wielded
against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tenant by the son of <div class="bookquote">``a person who holds land under a
gentleman who has some property in the parish.''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>It was thus the
Marquis was accustomed to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) neighbour, Mr. Gilmore, who,
in the Marquis's eyes, was a man not big enough to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) tenants
called his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) people. That such a man as Sam Brattle should have
murdered such a one as Mr. Trumbull, was to the Marquis an insult
rather than an injury; and now it was to be enhanced by the release
of the man from prison, and that by order of a bench of magistrates
on which Mr. Gilmore sat!

<p/>And there was more in it even than all this. It was very well known
at Turnover Park,--the seat of Lord Trowbridge, near Westbury,--that
Mr. Gilmore, the gentleman who held property in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) lordship's parish
of Bullhampton, and Mr. Fenwick, who was vicar of the same, were
another Damon and Pythias. Now the ladies at Turnover, who were much
devoted to the Low Church, had heard and doubtless believed, that our
friend, Mr. Fenwick, was little better than an infidel. When first
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had come into the county, they had been very anxious to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
out to be a High Churchman, and a story or two about a cross and
a candlestick were fabricated for their gratification. There was
at that time the remnant of a great fight going on between the
Trowbridge people and another great family in the neighbourhood on
this subject; and it would have suited the Ladies Stowte,--John
Augustus Stowte was the Marquis of Trowbridge,--to have enlisted our
parson among their enemies of this class; but the accusation fell so
plump to the ground, was so impossible of support, that they were
obliged to content themselves with knowing that Mr. Fenwick was--an
infidel! To do the Marquis justice, we must declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would
not have troubled himself on this score, if Mr. Fenwick would have
submitted himself to become one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) people. The Marquis was master
at home, and the Ladies Sophie and Carolina would have been proud to
entertain Mr. Fenwick by the week together at Turnover, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) been
willing, infidel or believer, to join that faction. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) never
joined that faction, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was not only the bosom friend of the
<div class="bookquote">``gentleman who owned some land in the parish;''  (<font color='red'><b>the bosom friend</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was twice more
rebellious than that gentleman himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had contradicted the
Marquis flat to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) face,--so the Marquis said himself,--when they
met once about some business in the parish; and again, when, in the
Vicar's early days in Bullhampton, some gathering for school-festival
purposes was made in the great home field behind Farmer Trumbull's
house, Mrs. Fenwick misbehaved herself egregiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) patronised us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophie/Lady Sophie</b></font>)</div>said Lady Sophie, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
did, indeed! And you know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father was just a common
builder at Loring, who made some money by a speculation in bricks and
mortar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophie/Lady Sophie</b></font>)</div><p/>When Lady Sophie said this she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) was, no doubt, ignorant of the fact
that Mr. Balfour had been the younger son of a family much more
ancient than her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) own, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Balfour</b></font>) had taken a double-first at Oxford,
had been a member of half the learned societies in Europe, and had
belonged to two or three of the best clubs in London.

<p/>From all this it will be seen that the Marquis of Trowbridge would
be disposed to think ill of whatever might be done in regard to the
murder by the Gilmore-Fenwick party in the parish. And then there
were tales about for which there was perhaps some foundation, that
the Vicar and the murderer had been very dear friends. It was
certainly believed at Turnover that the Vicar and Sam Brattle had
for years past spent the best part of their Sundays fishing together.
There were tales of rat-killing matches in which they had been
engaged,--originating in the undeniable fact of a certain campaign
against rats at the mill, in which the Vicar had taken an ardent
part. Undoubtedly the destruction of vermin, and, in regard to one
species, its preservation for the sake of destruction,--and the
catching of fish,--and the shooting of birds,--were things lovely
in the Vicar's eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), perhaps, did let his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) pastoral dignity go
a little by the board, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) and Sam stooped together, each with
a ferret in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) hand, grovelling in the dust to get at certain
rat-advantages in the mill. Gilmore, who had seen it, had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
of this. <div class="bookquote">``I understand it all, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Fenwick had said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
friend, <div class="bookquote">``and know very well I have got to choose between two things.
I must be called a hypocrite, or else I must be one. I have no doubt
that as years go on with me I shall see the advantage of choosing the
latter.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>There were at that time frequent discussions between them
on the same subject, for they were friends who could dare to discuss
each other's modes of life; but the reader need not be troubled
further now with this digression. The position which the Vicar held
in the estimation of the Marquis of Trowbridge will probably be
sufficiently well understood.

<p/>The family at Turnover Park would have thought it a great blessing
to have had a clergyman at Bullhampton with whom they could have
cordially co-operated; but, failing this, they had taken Mr.
Puddleham, the Methodist minister, to their arms. From Mr. Puddleham
they learned parish facts and parish fables, which would never have
reached them but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) assistance. Mr. Fenwick was well aware of
this, and used to declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had no objection to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would
protest that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could not see why Mr. Puddleham should not get along
in the parish just as well as himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) having, and meaning to
keep to himself, the slight advantages of the parish church, the
vicarage-house, and the small tithes. Of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) was quite sure, that
Mr. Puddleham's religious teaching was better than none at all; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) was by no means convinced,--so he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) said,--that, for some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
parishioners, Mr. Puddleham was not a better teacher than he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) himself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) always shook hands with Mr. Puddleham, though Mr. Puddleham
would never look him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) in the face, and was quite determined that Mr.
Puddleham should not be a thorn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) side.

<p/>In this matter of Sam Brattle's imprisonment and now intended
liberation, tidings from the parish were doubtless conveyed by Mr.
Puddleham to Turnover,--probably not direct, but still in such a
manner that the great people at Turnover knew to whom they were
indebted. Now Mr. Gilmore had certainly, from the first, been by no
means disposed to view favourably the circumstances attaching to
Sam Brattle on that Saturday night. When the great blow fell on the
Brattle family, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) demeanour to them was changed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) forgave
the miller's contumacy; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had always thought that Sam had been
guilty. The parson had from the first regarded the question with
great doubt, but, nevertheless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) opinion too had at first been
averse to Sam. Even now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was so resolute that Sam should be
released, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) founded his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) demand, not on Sam's innocence, but on the
absence of any evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>)'s entitled to fair play, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would say to Gilmore, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>)
is not getting it, because there is a prejudice against him (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>). You hear
what that old ass, Sir Thomas, says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Thomas is a very good magistrate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) don't take care, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)'ll find himself in trouble for keeping the
lad locked up without authority. Is there a juryman in the country
would find him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) guilty because he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was lying in the old man's ditch a
week before?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>In this way Gilmore also became a favourer of Sam's
claim to be released; and at last it came to be understood that on
the next Tuesday he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would be released, unless further evidence should
be forthcoming.

<p/>And then it came to pass that a certain very remarkable meeting took
place in the parish. Word was brought to Mr. Gilmore on Monday, the
5th October, that the Marquis of Trowbridge was to be at the Church
Farm,--poor Trumbull's farm,--on that day at noon, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
lordship thought that it might be expedient that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) and Mr. Gilmore
should meet on the occasion. There was no note, but the message was
brought by Mr. Packer, a sub-agent, one of the Marquis's people, with
whom Mr. Gilmore was very well acquainted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll walk down about that time, Packer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore, <div class="bookquote">``and
shall be very happy to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>) lordship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/>Now the Marquis never sat as a magistrate at the Heytesbury bench,
and had not been present on any of the occasions on which Sam had
been examined; nor had Mr. Gilmore seen the Marquis since the
murder,--nor, for the matter of that, for the last twelve months. Mr.
Gilmore had just finished breakfast when the news was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) might as well walk down and see Fenwick first. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
interview with the parson ended in a promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), Fenwick, would
also look in at the farm.

<p/>At twelve o'clock the Marquis was seated in the old farmer's
arm-chair, in the old farmer's parlour. The house was dark and
gloomy, never having been altogether opened since the murder. With
the Marquis was Packer, who was standing, and the Marquis was
pretending to cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) eye over one or two books which had been
brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had been taken all over the house; had stood
looking at the bed where the old man lay when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was attacked,
as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might possibly discover, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked long enough,
something that would reveal the truth; had gazed awe-struck at the
spot on which the body had been found, and had taken occasion to
remark to himself that the house was a good deal out of order. The
Marquis was a man nearer seventy than sixty, but very hale, and with
few signs of age. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was short and plump, with hardly any beard on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) face, and short grey hair, of which nothing could be seen when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) countenance would not have been bad, had not the
weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) marquisate always been there; nor would his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) heart have
been bad, had it not been similarly burdened. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was a silly,
weak, ignorant man, whose own capacity would hardly have procured
bread for him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) in any trade or profession, had bread not been so
adequately provided for him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) fathers before him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gilmore said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would be here at twelve, Packer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it's past twelve now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One minute, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the peer looked again at poor old Trumbull's books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not wait, Packer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better tell them to put the horses to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Packer/Mr. Packer</b></font>)</div><p/>But just as Packer went out into the passage for the sake of giving
the order he (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>) met Mr. Gilmore, and ushered him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! Mr. Gilmore; yes, I am very glad to see you, Mr. Gilmore;''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>and
the Marquis came forward to shake hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) visitor. <div class="bookquote">``I thought
it better that you and I should meet about this sad affair in the
parish;--a very sad affair, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It certainly is, Lord Trowbridge; and the mystery makes it more so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose there is no real mystery, Mr. Gilmore? I suppose there can
be no doubt that that unfortunate young man did,--did,--did bear a
hand in it at least?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that there is very much doubt, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you, indeed? I think there is none,--not the least. And all the
police force are of the same opinion. I have considerable experiences
of my own in these matters; but I should not venture, perhaps, to
express my opinion so confidently, if I were not backed by the
police. You are aware, Mr. Gilmore, that the police are--very--seldom
wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be tempted to say that they are very seldom right--except
when the circumstances are all under their noses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say I differ from you entirely, Mr. Gilmore. Now, in this
case--''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>The Marquis was here interrupted by a knock at the door, and,
before the summons could be answered, the parson entered the room.
And with the parson came Mr. Puddleham. The Marquis had thought that
the parson might, perhaps, intrude; and Mr. Puddleham was in waiting
as a make-weight, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) be wanting. When Mr. Fenwick had met
the minister hanging about the farmyard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had displayed not the
slightest anger. If Mr. Puddleham chose to come in also, and make
good his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) doing so before the Marquis, it was nothing to Mr. Fenwick.
The great man looked up, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were very much startled and
somewhat offended; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did at last condescend to shake hands,
first with one clergyman and then with the other, and to ask them to
sit down. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come over to make some personal
inquiry into the melancholy matter, and then proceeded with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
opinion respecting Sam Brattle. <div class="bookquote">``From all that I can hear and see,''
 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lordship, <div class="bookquote">``I fear there can be no doubt that this murder has
been due to the malignity of a near neighbour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean the poor boy that is in prison, my lord?''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>asked the
parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do, Mr. Fenwick. The constabulary are of opinion--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We know that, Lord Trowbridge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, Mr. Fenwick, you will allow me to express my own ideas. The
constabulary, I say, are of opinion that there is no manner of doubt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was one of those who broke into my tenant's house on that
fatal night; and, as I was explaining to Mr. Gilmore when you did us
the honour to join us, in the course of a long provincial experience
I have seldom known the police to be in error.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Lord Trowbridge--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, Mr. Fenwick, I will go on. My time here cannot be
long, and I have a proposition which I am desirous of making to
Mr. Gilmore, as a magistrate acting in this part of the county. Of
course, it is not for me to animadvert upon what the magistrates may
do at the bench to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure your lordship would make no such animadversion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not intend it, for many reasons. But I may go so far as to say
that a demand for the young man's release will be made.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is to be released, I presume, as a matter of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the
parson.

<p/>The Marquis made no allusion to this, but went on. <div class="bookquote">``If that be
done,--and I must say that I think no such step would be taken by the
bench at Westbury,--whither will the young man betake himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Home to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Back into this parish, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paramour, to murder more of my
tenants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord, I cannot allow such an unjust statement to be made,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said
the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to speak for one moment; and I wish it to be remembered that
I am addressing myself especially to your neighbour, Mr. Gilmore, who
has done me the honour of waiting upon me here at my request. I do
not object to your presence, Mr. Fenwick, or to that of any other
gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>and the Marquis bowed to Mr. Puddleham, who had stood by
hitherto without speaking a word; <div class="bookquote">``but, if you please, I must carry
out the purpose that has brought me here. I shall think it very sad
indeed, if this young man be allowed to take up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) residence in the
parish after what has taken place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father has a house here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am aware of the fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis. <div class="bookquote">``I believe that the young
man's father holds a mill from you, and some few acres of land?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has a very nice farm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it. We will not quarrel about terms. I believe there is no
lease?--though, of course, that is no business of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say that it is not, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore, who was
waxing wrothy and becoming very black about the brows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just said so; but I suppose you will admit that I have some
interest in this parish? I presume that these two gentlemen, who are
God's ministers here, will acknowledge that it is my duty, as the
owner of the greater part of the parish, to interfere?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Puddleham.

<p/>Mr. Fenwick said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) sat, or rather leant, against the edge
of a table, and smiled. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) brow was not black, like that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
friend; but Gilmore, who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and who looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) face,
began to fear that the Marquis would be addressed before long in
terms stronger than he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) himself, Mr. Gilmore, would approve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) lordship, <div class="bookquote">``that the unfortunate
man who has fallen a victim had been for nearly half a century a
tenant of myself and of my family, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was foully murdered
on my own property,--dragged from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed in the middle of the night,
and ruthlessly slaughtered in this very house in which I am sitting,
and that this has been done in a parish of which I own, I think,
something over two-thirds--''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two thousand and two acres out of two thousand nine hundred and
ten,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Puddleham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so. Well, Mr. Puddleham, you need not have interrupted
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg pardon, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I mean to say is this, Mr. Gilmore,--that you should take steps
to prevent that young man's return among our people. You should
explain to the father that it cannot be allowed. From what I hear, it
would be no loss if the whole family left the parish. I am told that
one of the daughters is a--prostitute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too true, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Puddleham.

<p/>The parson turned round and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) colleague, but said
nothing. It was one of the principles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) life that he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) wouldn't
quarrel with Mr. Puddleham; and at the present moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) certainly
did not wish to waste his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) anger on so weak an enemy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that you should look to this, Mr. Gilmore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>said the
Marquis, completing his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) harangue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot conceive, my lord, what right you have to dictate to me in
such a matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not dictated at all; I have simply expressed my opinion,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my lord, will you allow me for a moment?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick.
<div class="bookquote">``In the first place, if Sam Brattle could not find a home at the
mill,--which I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) will do for many a long year to come,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
should have one at the Vicarage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/>Mr. Puddleham held up both hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might as well hold your tongue, Frank,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a matter on which I wish to say a word or two, Harry. I have
been appealed to as one of God's ministers here, and I acknowledge my
responsibility. I never in my life heard any proposition more cruel
or inhuman than that made by Lord Trowbridge. This young man is to be
turned out because a tenant of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lordship has been murdered! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
to be adjudged to be guilty by us, without any trial, in the absence
of all evidence, in opposition to the decision of the magistrates--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not in opposition to the magistrates, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to be forbidden to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own home, simply because Lord
Trowbridge thinks him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) guilty! My lord, his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) father's house is his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own,
to entertain whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) may please, as much as is yours. And were I to
suggest to you to turn out your daughters, it would be no worse an
offence than your suggesting to Mr. Brattle that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) should turn out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My daughters!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, your daughters, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you mention my daughters?''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``How dare you mention my daughters?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``The ladies, I am well aware, are all that is respectable. I have
not the slightest wish that you should ill-use them. But if you
desire that your family concerns should be treated with reserve and
reticence, you had better learn to treat the family affairs of others
in the same way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The Marquis by this time was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) feet, and was calling for
Packer,--was calling for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) carriage and horses,--was calling on
the very gods to send down their thunder to punish such insolence
as this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had never heard of the like in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) experience. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
daughters! And then there came across his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) dismayed mind an idea that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) daughters had been put upon a par with that young murderer, Sam
Brattle,--perhaps even on a par with something worse than this. And
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) daughters were such august persons,--old and ugly, it is true,
and almost dowerless in consequence of the nature of the family
settlements and family expenditure. It was an injury and an insult
that Mr. Fenwick should make the slightest allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) daughters;
but to talk of them in such a way as this, as though they were
mere ordinary human beings, was not to be endured! The Marquis had
hitherto had his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) doubts, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was quite sure that Mr. Fenwick
was an infidel. <div class="bookquote">``And a very bad sort of infidel, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said to
Lady Carolina on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) return home. <div class="bookquote">``I never heard of such conduct in
all my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>said Lord Trowbridge, walking down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) carriage.
<div class="bookquote">``Who can be surprised that there should be murderers and prostitutes
in the parish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord, they don't sit under me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Puddleham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care who they sit under,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) lordship.

<p/>As they walked away together, Mr. Fenwick had just a word to say to
Mr. Puddleham. <div class="bookquote">``My friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you were quite right about his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
lordship's acres.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those are the numbers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Puddleham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that you were quite right to make the observation. Facts are
always valuable, and I am sure Lord Trowbridge was obliged to you.
But I think you were a little wrong as to another statement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What statement, Mr. Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What you said about poor Carry Brattle. You don't know it as a
fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody says so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has not married, and become an honest woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is possible, of course. Though as for that,--when a young woman
has once gone astray--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As did Mary Magdalene, for instance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fenwick, it was a very bad case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And isn't my case very bad,--and yours? Are we not in a bad
way,--unless we believe and repent? Have we not all so sinned as to
deserve eternal punishment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Mr. Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there can't be much difference between her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) can't
deserve more than eternal punishment. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) believes and repents,
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sins will be white as snow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Mr. Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as you would of any other sister or brother,--not
as a thing that must be always vile because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has fallen once.
Women will so speak,--and other men. One sees something of a reason
for it. But you and I, as Christian ministers, should never allow
ourselves to speak so thoughtlessly of sinners. Good morning, Mr.
Puddleham.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVIII.

<p/>BLANK PAPER.


<p/>Early in October Captain Marrable was called up to town by letters
from Messrs. Block and Curling, and according to promise wrote
various letters to Mary Lowther, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) of the manner in which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) business progressed. All of these letters were shown to Aunt
Sarah,--and would have been shown to Parson John were it not that
Parson John declined to read them. But though the letters were purely
cousinly,--just such letters as a brother might write,--yet Miss
Marrable thought that they were dangerous. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did not say so; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) thought that they were dangerous. Of late Mary had spoken no word
of Mr. Gilmore; and Aunt Sarah, through all this silence, was able
to discover that Mr. Gilmore's prospects were not becoming brighter.
Mary herself, having quite made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind that Mr. Gilmore's
prospects, so far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was concerned, were all over, could not
decide how and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should communicate the resolve to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lover.
According to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) present agreement with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
at once should she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) accept any other offer; and was to wait for six
months if this should not be the case. Certainly, there was no rival
in the field, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not quite know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought
or ought not to write at once in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) present circumstances of assured
determination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) soon told herself that in this respect also she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
would go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) new-found brother for advice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would ask him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and
do just as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not already proved how fit a
person he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was to give advice on such a subject?

<p/>After an absence of ten days he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came home, and nothing could exceed
Mary's anxiety as to the tidings which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should bring with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
endeavoured not to be selfish about the matter; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not but
acknowledge that, even as regarded herself, the difference between
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) going to India or staying at home was so great as to affect
the whole colour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life. There was, perhaps, something of the
feeling of being subject to desertion about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered
that in giving up Mr. Gilmore she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must also give up the Fenwicks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
could not hope to go to Bullhampton again, at least for many a long
day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be very much alone if her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) new brother were to leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) now. On the morning after his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arrival he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came up to them at
Uphill, and told them that the matter was almost settled. Messrs.
Block and Curling had declared that it was as good as settled; the
money would be saved, and there would be, out of the L20,000 which
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had inherited, something over L4000 for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); so that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) need not
return to India. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was in very high spirits, and did not speak a
word of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father's iniquities.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Walter, what a joy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, with the tears streaming from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) by both her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) forehead. At that
moment Aunt Sarah was not in the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so very, very happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) said, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) little hands
against his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/>Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) brother? And then,
before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) remembered she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had something special to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>);--something to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Would he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) that evening?
Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) aunt, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) little arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) niece's
waist, and embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``don't fall in love with Walter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say anything so foolish, Aunt Sarah?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be very foolish to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't understand how completely different it is. Do you think
I could be so intimate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) as I am if anything of the kind were
possible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know how that may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not begrudge it me because I have found a cousin that I can love
almost as I would a brother. There has never been anybody yet for
whom I could have that sort of feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Sarah, whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) might think, had not the heart to repeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
caution; and Mary, quite happy and contented with herself, put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
hat to run down the hill and meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin at the great gates of
the Lowtown Rectory. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) be dragged up the hill, to escort
a cousin down again? This arrangement had, therefore, been made
between them.

<p/>For the first mile or two the talk was all about Messrs. Block and
Curling and the money. Captain Marrable was so full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) own
purposes, and so well contented that so much should be saved to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
out of the fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had lost, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had, perhaps, forgotten that
Mary required more advice. But when they had come to the spot on
which they had before sat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) stop and seat himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) rolled himself comfortably close
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) story, and explained her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) doubts, and asked
for the revelations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wisdom. <div class="bookquote">``Are you quite sure about the
propriety of this, Mary?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The propriety of what, Walter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Giving up a man who loves you so well, and who has so much to
offer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it you said yourself? Sure! Of course I am sure. I am quite
sure. I do not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). Did I not tell you that there could be no
doubt after what you said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean that my words should be so powerful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were powerful; but, independently of that, I am quite sure now.
If I could do it myself, I should be false to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). I know that I do
not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was lying, but was
playing with a cigar-case which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had taken out, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) were
about to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) smoking. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did not open the case, or look
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), or say a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Two minutes had perhaps passed
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke again. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it would be best that I should
write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no one else, then, you care for, Mary?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, as though the question were nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all blank paper with you?''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``It is all blank paper with you?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite blank,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, and laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, I almost think it
always will be blank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By G--! it is not blank with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, springing up
and jumping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), not in the least
understanding what he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) meant, not dreaming even that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was about to
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) love secrets in reference to another. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what you
think I'm made of, Mary;--whether you imagine I have any affection to
bestow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not in the least understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) knelt down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``it
is simply this, that you have become to me more than all the
world;--that I love you better than my own soul;--that your beauty
and sweetness, and soft, darling touch, are everything to me. And
then you come to me for advice! I can only give you one bit of advice
now, Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Love me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but love me and be my wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had to think of it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew from the first moment that the
thinking of it was a delight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not quite understand
at first that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chosen brother might become her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lover, with no
other feeling than that of joy and triumph; and yet there was a
consciousness that no other answer but one was possible. In the first
place, to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) anything, asked in love, would be impossible.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not say No to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had struggled often in reference
to Mr. Gilmore, and had found it impossible to say Yes. There was
now the same sort of impossibility in regard to the No. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) couldn't
blacken herself with such a lie. And yet, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was sure of
this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was so astounded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) declaration, so carried off her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
legs by the alteration in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) position, so hard at work within
herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) new endeavour to change the aspect in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must
look at the man, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not even bring herself to think of
answering him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would only sit down near her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) for awhile,--very
near,--and not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be happy.
Everything else was forgotten. Aunt Sarah's caution, Janet Fenwick's
anger, poor Gilmore's sorrow,--of all these she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought not at all,
or only allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) mind to dwell on them as surrounding trifles, of
which it would be necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), that they--they two who were
now all in all to each other--must dispose; as they must, also, of
questions of income, and such like little things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was without a
doubt. The man was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) master, and had her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keeping, and of
course she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would obey him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) must settle her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) voice, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
pulses become calm, and remember herself before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
so. <div class="bookquote">``Sit down again, Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I sit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I ask you. Sit down, Walter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I understand how wise you will be, and how cold; and I
understand, too, what a fool I have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter, will you not come when I ask you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I sit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I may try to tell you how dearly I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not sit, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) feet, and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) lap. There were but few more words spoken then. When it
comes to this, that a pair of lovers are content to sit and rub their
feathers together like two birds, there is not much more need of
talking. Before they had arisen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) fingers had been playing through
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) curly hair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) lips and cheeks as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
forehead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had begun to feel what it was to have a lover and to
love him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could already talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) almost as though he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) were a
part of herself, could whisper to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) little words of nonsense, could
feel that everything of hers was his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), and everything of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was hers.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew more clearly now even than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had done before that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had
never loved Mr. Gilmore, and never could have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). And that
other doubt had been solved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had said,
not yet an hour ago, <div class="bookquote">``that I think it always will be blank.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And now
every spot of the canvas was covered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must go home now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And tell Aunt Sarah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) replied, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and tell Aunt Sarah;--but not to-night. I can do nothing
to-night but think about it. Oh, Walter, I am so happy!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIX.

<p/>SAM BRATTLE RETURNS HOME.


<p/>The Tuesday's magistrates' meeting had come off at Heytesbury, and
Sam Brattle had been discharged. Mr. Jones had on this occasion
indignantly demanded that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) client should be set free without bail;
but to this the magistrates would not assent. The attorney attempted
to demonstrate to them that they could not require bail for the
reappearance of an accused person, when that accused person was
discharged simply because there was no evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>). But to
this exposition of the law Sir Thomas and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) brother magistrates
would not listen. <div class="bookquote">``If the other persons should at last be taken, and
Brattle should not then be forthcoming, justice would suffer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Charleys</b></font>)</div>said
Sir Thomas. County magistrates, as a rule, are more conspicuous for
common sense and good instincts than for sound law; and Mr. Jones
may, perhaps, have been right in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) view of the case. Nevertheless
bail was demanded, and was not forthcoming without considerable
trouble. Mr. Jay, the ironmonger at Warminster, declined. When spoken
to on the subject by Mr. Fenwick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) declared that the feeling among
the gentry was so strong against his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) brother-in-law, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could
not bring himself to put himself forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) couldn't do it for the
sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) family. When Fenwick promised to make good the money
risk, Jay declared that the difficulty did not lie there. <div class="bookquote">``There's
the Marquis, and Sir Thomas, and Squire Greenthorne, and our parson,
all say, sir, as how he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) shouldn't be bailed at all. And then, sir,
if one has a misfortune belonging to one, one doesn't want to flaunt
it in everybody's face, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div>And there was trouble, too, with
George Brattle from Fordingbridge. George Brattle was a prudent,
hard-headed, hard-working man, not troubled with much sentiment, and
caring very little what any one could say of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as long as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rent
was paid; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken it into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head that Sam was guilty,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was at any rate a thoroughly bad fellow who should be turned
out of the Brattle nest, and that no kindness was due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). With
the farmer, however, Mr. Fenwick did prevail, and then the parson
became the other bondsman himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had been strongly advised,--by
Gilmore, by Gilmore's uncle, the prebendary at Salisbury, and by
others,--not to put himself forward in this position. The favour
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had shown to the young man had not borne good results
either for the young man or for himself; and it would be unwise,--so
said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends,--to subject his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own name to more remark than
was necessary. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had so far assented as to promise not to come
forward himself, if other bailsmen could be procured. But, when the
difficulty came, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offered himself, and was, of necessity, accepted.

<p/>When Sam was released, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was like a caged animal who, when liberty
is first offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), does not know how to use it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) looked
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) in the hall of the Court House, and did not at first seem
disposed to leave it. The constable had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) had
means of getting home, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) replied, that <div class="bookquote">``it wasn't no more
than a walk.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dinner was offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) by the constable, but this he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>)
refused, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) stood glaring about him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>). After a while Gilmore
and Fenwick came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and the Squire was the first to speak.
<div class="bookquote">``Brattle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you will now go home, and remain there
working with your father for the present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know nothing about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the lad, not deigning to look
at the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sam, pray go home at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson. <div class="bookquote">``We have done what we
could for you, and you should not oppose us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fenwick, if you tells me to go to--to--to,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was going to
mention some very bad place, but was restrained by the parson's
presence,--<div class="bookquote">``if you tells me to go anywheres, I'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right. Then I tell you to go to the mill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know as father'll let me in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>), almost breaking into
sobs as he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will, heartily. Do you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that you had a word or two
with me here, and that I'll come up and call on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) pocket, and whispering something, offered
the lad money. But Sam turned away, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) head, and walked
off. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe that that fellow had any more to do with it
than you or I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore. <div class="bookquote">``Have you heard that
the Marquis is in the town? Greenthorne just told me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I had better get out of it, for Heytesbury isn't big enough
for the two of us. Come, you've done here, and we might as well jog
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/>Gilmore dined at the Vicarage that evening, and of course the day's
work was discussed. The quarrel, too, which had taken place at the
farmhouse had only yet been in part described to Mrs. Fenwick. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you know I feel half triumphant and half frightened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Fenwick
said to the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``I know that the Marquis is an old fool,
imperious, conceited, and altogether unendurable when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) attempts
to interfere. And yet I have a kind of feeling that because he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) is a
Marquis, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) owns two thousand and so many acres in the
parish, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) lives at Turnover Park, one ought to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
in awe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Frank didn't hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) in awe yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) holds nothing in awe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>said the wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wrong me there, Janet. I hold you in great awe, and every lady
in Wiltshire more or less;--and I think I may say every woman. And
I would hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) in a sort of awe, too, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) didn't drive me beyond
myself by his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) mixture of folly and pride.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) can do us a great deal of mischief, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) can do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) even gave me a bad
name, no doubt; but I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was generous enough to me in that way
before yesterday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will now declare that I am the Evil One himself,
and people won't believe that. A continued persistent enmity,
always at work, but kept within moderate bounds, is more dangerous
now-a-days, than a hot fever of revengeful wrath. The Marquis can't
send out his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) men-at-arms and have me knocked on the head, or cast
into a dungeon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) can only throw mud at me, and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) throws
at once, the less will reach me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>As to Sam, they were agreed that, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) were innocent or guilty,
the old miller should be induced to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) as innocent, as far as
their joint exertion in that direction might avail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) is innocent before the law till he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) has been proved to be guilty,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then of course there can be nothing wrong in telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) father that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) is innocent,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady.

<p/>The Squire did not quite admit this, and the parson smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
heard the argument; but they both acknowledged that it would be right
to let it be considered throughout the parish that Sam was to be
regarded as blameless for that night's transaction. Nevertheless, Mr.
Gilmore's mind on the subject was not changed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard from Loring?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>the Squire asked Mrs. Fenwick as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) got
up to leave the Vicarage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,--constantly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) is quite well, Mr. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I sometimes think that I'll go off and have a look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure both she (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) aunt would be glad to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But would it be wise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you ask me, I am bound to say that I think it would not be wise.
If I were you, I would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) for awhile. Mary is as good as gold,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is a woman; and, like other women, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is sought,
the more difficult she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It always seems to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore, <div class="bookquote">``that to be successful in
love, a man should not be in love at all; or, at any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should
hide it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) went off home alone, feeling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) heart that
pernicious load of a burden which comes from the unrestrained longing
for some good thing which cannot be attained. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) now
that nothing in life would be worth a thought if Mary Lowther should
continue to say him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) nay; and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), too, that unless the
yea were said very quickly, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) aptitudes for enjoyment would be
worn out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>).

<p/>On the next morning, immediately after breakfast, Mr. and Mrs.
Fenwick walked down to the mill together. They went through the
village, and thence by a pathway down to a little foot-bridge, and so
along the river side. It was a beautiful October morning, the 7th of
October, and Fenwick talked of the pheasants. Gilmore, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was
a sportsman, and shot rabbits and partridges about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own property,
and went occasionally to shooting-parties at a distance, preserved
no game. There had been some old unpleasantness about the Marquis's
pheasants, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had given it up. There could be no doubt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
property in the parish being chiefly low lying lands and water meads
unfit for coverts, was not well disposed for preserving pheasants,
and that in shooting he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would more likely shoot Lord Trowbridge's
birds than his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) own. But it was equally certain that Lord Trowbridge's
pheasants made no scruple of feeding on his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) land. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
had thought it right to give up all idea of keeping up a head of game
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) own use in Bullhampton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, if I were you, Gilmore,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson, as a bird
rose from the ground close at their feet, <div class="bookquote">``I should cease to be nice
about the shooting after what happened yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean that you would retaliate, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that good parson's law?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very good squire's law. And as for that doctrine of
non-retaliation, a man should be very sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own motives before
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) submits to it. If a man be quite certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is really
actuated by a Christian's desire to forgive, it may be all very well;
but if there be any admixture of base alloy in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gold, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) allows
himself to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may avoid the evils of pugnacity, and have
things go smooth for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here, and become a good Christian by the
same process, why then I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is likely to fall to the ground
between two stools.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>Had Lord Trowbridge heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) lordship
would now have been quite sure that Mr. Fenwick was an infidel.

<p/>They had both doubted whether Sam would be found at the mill; but
there he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was, hard at work among the skeleton timbers, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
friends reached the place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to see you at home again, Sam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, with
something, however, of an inner feeling that perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might be
saluting a murderer.

<p/>Sam touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) cap, but did not utter a word, or look away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
work. They passed on amidst the heaps in front of the mill, and came
to the porch before the cottage. Here, as had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) wont in all
these idle days, the miller was sitting with a pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) mouth.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) saw the lady he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) got up and ducked his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) head, and then sat down
again. <div class="bookquote">``If your wife is here, I'll just step in, Mr. Brattle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) be there, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, pointing towards the kitchen
window with his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) head. So Mrs. Fenwick lifted the latch and entered.
The parson sat himself down by the miller's side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am heartily glad, Mr. Brattle, that Sam is back with you here once
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) be there, at work among the rest o' 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) as I came along. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) will remain here now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say, Muster Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) intends to do so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say, Muster Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it not be well that you should ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not as I knows on, Muster Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>It was manifest enough that the old man had not spoken to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son
on the subject of the murder, and that there was no confidence,--at
least, no confidence that had been expressed,--between the father and
the son. No one had as yet heard the miller utter any opinion as to
Sam's innocence or his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) guilt. This of itself seemed to the clergyman
to be a very terrible condition for two persons who were so closely
united, and who were to live together, work together, eat together,
and have mutual interests.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, Mr. Brattle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that you give Sam the full benefit
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) discharge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'ll get his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) vittles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) bed, and a trifle of wages if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) works
for 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean that. I'm quite sure you wouldn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) want a
comfortable home, as long as you have one to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't much comfort about it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was speaking of your own opinion of the deed that was done. My own
opinion is that Sam had nothing to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I can't say, Muster Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it would be a comfort to you to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) is innocent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ain't no comfort in talking about it,--not at all,--and I'd
rayther not, if it's all one to you, Muster Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not ask another question, but I'll repeat my own opinion, Mr.
Brattle. I don't believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had anything more to do with the
robbery or the murder, than I had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not, Muster Fenwick. Murder is a terrible crime. And now, if
you'll tell me how much it was you paid the lawyer at Heytesbury--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say as yet. It will be some trifle. You need not trouble
yourself about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I mean to pay `un, Muster Fenwick. I can pay my way as yet,
though it's hard enough at times.''  (<font color='red'><b>The parson</b></font>)</div>The parson was obliged to promise
that Mr. Jones's bill of charges should be sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
called his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) wife, and they left the mill. Sam was still up among the
timbers, and had not once come down while the visitors were in the
cottage. Mrs. Fenwick had been more successful with the women than
the parson had been with the father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had taken upon herself to
say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thoroughly believed Sam to be innocent, and they had
thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) with many protestations of gratitude.

<p/>They did not go back by the way they had come, but went up to the
road, which they crossed, and thence to some outlying cottages which
were not very far from Hampton Privets House. From these cottages
there was a path across the fields back to Bullhampton, which led by
the side of a small wood belonging to the Marquis. There was a good
deal of woodland just here, and this special copse, called Hampton
bushes, was known to be one of the best pheasant coverts in that part
of the country. Whom should they meet, standing on the path, armed
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) gun, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) keeper behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) armed with another, than
the Marquis of Trowbridge himself. They had heard a shot or two, but
they had thought nothing of it, or they would have gone back to the
road. <div class="bookquote">``Don't speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson, as he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) walked on quickly with
his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wife on his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) arm. The Marquis stood and scowled; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had the
breeding of a gentleman, and when Mrs. Fenwick was close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hat. The parson also raised his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>), the lady bowed, and then
they passed on without a word. <div class="bookquote">``I had no excuse for doing so, or I
would certainly have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that Sam Brattle was comfortably at
home with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How you do like a fight, Frank!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it's stand up, and all fair, I don't dislike it.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XX.

<p/>I HAVE A JUPITER OF MY OWN NOW.


<p/>When Mary Lowther returned home from the last walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) cousin
that has been mentioned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was quite determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would
not disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) happiness on that night by the task of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
engagement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) aunt. It must, of course, be told, and that at
once; and it must be told also to Parson John; and a letter must be
written to Janet; and another, which would be very difficult in the
writing, to Mr. Gilmore; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) must be prepared to bear a certain
amount of opposition from all her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) friends; but for the present
moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) would free herself from these troubles. To-morrow, after
breakfast, she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) aunt. To-morrow, at lunch-time, Walter
would come up to the lane as her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) accepted lover. And then, after
lunch, after due consultation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) and with Aunt Sarah, the
letter should be written.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had solved, at any rate, one doubt, and had investigated one
mystery. While conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) own coldness towards Mr. Gilmore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
had doubted whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was capable of loving a man, of loving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as
Janet Fenwick loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would not admit to herself
that any woman that ever lived adored a man more thoroughly than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
adored Walter Marrable. It was sweet to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to see and to remember
the motions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) body. When walking by his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) side she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could hardly
forbear to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulder. When parting from him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) it was
a regret to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told herself that
all this had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the course of one morning's walk, and
wondered at it,--that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart should be a thing capable of being
given away so quickly. It had, in truth, been given away quickly
enough, though the work had not been done in that one morning's walk.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been truly honest, to herself and to others, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said
that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cousin Walter was and should be a brother to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but had
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) new brother, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) brotherly confidence, told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
heart was devoted to some other woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have suffered a
blow, though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would never have confessed even to herself that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suffered. On that evening, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reached home, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said very
little.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was so tired. Might she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go to bed? <div class="bookquote">``What, at nine o'clock?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>asked
Aunt Sarah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll stay up, if you wish it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/>But before ten she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own chamber, sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own
chair, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arms folded, feeling, rather than thinking, how
divine a thing it was to be in love. What could she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) not do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?
What would she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) not endure to have the privilege of living with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?
What other good fortune in life could be equal to this good fortune?
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) relations with Mr. Gilmore, and shuddered
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered how near she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been to accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It would
have been so wrong. And yet I did not see it! With him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) I am sure that
it is right, for I feel that in going to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) I can be every bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dreamed; and then the morning came, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had to go down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breakfast almost in
silence, having resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) story the moment
breakfast was over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had, over night, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in bed,
studiously endeavoured not to con any mode of telling it. Up to
the moment at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rose her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) happiness was, if possible, to be
untroubled. But while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dressed herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) endeavoured to arrange
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) plans. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at last came to the conclusion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could do it
best without any plan.

<p/>As soon as Aunt Sarah had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) breakfast, and just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
was about to proceed, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) morning custom, down-stairs
to the kitchen, Mary spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Aunt Sarah, I have something to tell
you. I may as well bring it out at once. I am engaged to marry Walter
Marrable.''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Sarah immediately let fall the sugar-tongs, and stood
speechless. <div class="bookquote">``Dear aunt, do not look as if you were displeased. Say a
kind word to me. I am sure you do not think that I have intended to
deceive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I do not think that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Aunt Sarah</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Sarah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much surprised. It was yesterday that you told me, when
I hinted at this, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was no more to you than a cousin,--or a
brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I thought; indeed I did. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) told me how it was with
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), I knew at once that I had only one answer to give. No other
answer was possible. I love him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) better than anyone else in all the
world. I feel that I can promise to be his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife without the least
reserve or fear. I don't know why it should be so; but it is. I
know I am right in this.''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Sarah still stood silent, meditating.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you think I was right, feeling as I do, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) so? I had
before become certain, quite, quite certain that it was impossible to
give any other answer but one to Mr. Gilmore. Dearest aunt, do speak
to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know what you will have to live upon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is settled, you know, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) will save four or five thousand
pounds out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) money, and I have got twelve hundred. It is not
much, but it will be just something. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) will remain in the
army, and I shall be a soldier's wife. I shall think nothing of going
out to India, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wishes it; but I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) means that. Dear
Aunt Sarah, do say one word of congratulation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Sarah did not know how to congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) niece. It seemed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) that any congratulation must be false and hypocritical. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
thinking, it would be a most unfitting match. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) that
such an engagement had been most foolish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was astonished at
Mary's weakness, and was indignant with Walter Marrable. As regarded
Mary, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had twice uttered a word or two, intended as a
caution, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never thought it possible that a girl so steady
in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ordinary demeanour, so utterly averse to all flirtation, so
little given to the weakness of feminine susceptibility, would fall
at once into such a quagmire of indiscreet love-troubles. The caution
had been intended, rather in regard to outward appearances, and
perhaps with the view of preventing the possibility of some slight
heart-scratches, than with the idea that danger of this nature was to
be dreaded. As Mr. Gilmore was there as an acknowledged suitor,--a
suitor, as to whose ultimate success Aunt Sarah had her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) strong
opinions,--it would be well those cousinly-brotherly associations
and confidences should not become so close as to create possible
embarrassment. Such had been the nature of Aunt Sarah's caution; and
now,--in the course of a week or two,--when the young people were
in truth still strangers to each other,--when Mr. Gilmore was still
waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) answer,--Mary came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that the
engagement was a thing completed! How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) utter a word of
congratulation?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean, then, to say that you disapprove of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, almost
sternly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say that I think it wise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not speaking of wisdom. Of course, Mr. Gilmore is very much
richer, and all that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Mary, that I would not counsel you to marry a man because
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what you mean when you tell me I am not wise. I tried
it,--with all the power of thought and calculation that I could give
to it, and I found that I could not marry Mr. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not speaking about that now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that Walter is so poor, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) never should be allowed to
marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care twopence about Walter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do, Aunt Sarah. I care more about him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) than all the world
beside. I had to think for him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not take much time to think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly a minute--and yet it was sufficient.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) paused,
waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt; but it seemed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt had nothing further
to say. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>continued Mary, <div class="bookquote">``if it must be so, it must. If you
cannot wish me joy--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest, you know well enough that I wish you all happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my happiness.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>It seemed to the bewildered old lady that the
whole nature of the girl was altered. Mary was speaking now as might
have spoken some enthusiastic young female who had at last succeeded
in obtaining for herself the possession,--more or less permanent,--of
a young man, after having fed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) imagination on novels for the last
five years; whereas Mary Lowther had hitherto, in all moods of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
life, been completely opposite to such feminine ways and doings.
<div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>continued Mary; <div class="bookquote">``we will say nothing more about it at
present. I am greatly grieved that I have incurred your displeasure;
but I cannot wish it otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have said nothing of displeasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter is to be up after lunch, and I will only ask that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) may not
be received with black looks. If it must be visited as a sin, let it
be visited on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary, that is unkind and ungenerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you knew, Aunt Sarah, how I have longed during the night for your
kind voice,--for your sympathy and approval!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Sarah paused again for a moment, and then went down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
domestic duties without another word.

<p/>In the afternoon Walter came, but Aunt Sarah did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). When
Mary went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) the old lady declared that, for the present, it
would be better so. <div class="bookquote">``I do not know what to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) at present. I
must think of it, and speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) uncle, and try to find out what
had best be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was sitting as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said this up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own room, without even a
book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand; in very truth, passing an hour in an endeavour to
decide what, in the present emergency, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought to say or do. Mary
stooped over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and the aunt returned her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) niece's
caresses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not let you and me quarrel, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Marrable.
<div class="bookquote">``Who else is there that I care for? Whose happiness is anything to me
except yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) also shall be dear to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; at any rate, not now. Of course you can marry, Mary, without any
sanction from me. I do not pretend that you owe to me that obedience
which would be due to a mother. But I cannot say,--at least, not
yet,--that such sanction as I have to give can be given to this
engagement. I have a dread that it will come to no good. It grieves
me. I do not forbid you to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); but for the present it would
be better that I should not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) objection?''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div>demanded Walter, with grave indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thinks we shall be poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we ask her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for anything? Of course we shall be poor. For the
present there will be but L300 a year, or thereabouts, beyond my
professional income. A few years back, if so much had been secured,
friends would have thought that everything necessary had been done.
If you are afraid, Mary--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I am not afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), then? Of course we shall be poor,--very poor. But
we can live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>There did come upon Mary Lowther a feeling that Walter spoke of the
necessity of a comfortable income in a manner very different from
that in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had of late been discussing the same subject ever
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had declared that it was impossible that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) should exist in England as a bachelor on his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) professional income,
and yet surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would be poorer as a married man with that L300
a year added to it, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would have been without it, and also
without a wife. But what girl that loves a man can be angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
for such imprudence and such inconsistency? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had already told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would be ready, if it were necessary, to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
India. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had said so before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aunt's room. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoped no such sacrifice would be demanded from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``There can be no sacrifice on my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had replied, <div class="bookquote">``unless I
am required to give up you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms
and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). There are moments in one's life in which not to be
imprudent, not to be utterly, childishly forgetful of all worldly
wisdom, would be to be brutal, inhuman, and devilish. <div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) told
Parson John?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) eyebrows, and suggested `that I had
changed my ideas of life.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``All right!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
replied. <div class="bookquote">``I hope that Block and Curling won't have made any mistake
about the L5000.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks we're two
fools; but then one's folly won't embarrass him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor will it embarrass Aunt Sarah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is this difference. If we come to grief, Parson John will
eat his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) dinner without the slightest interference with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) appetite
from our misfortunes; but Aunt Sarah would suffer on your account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we will not come to grief. At any rate, darling, we cannot
consent to be made wise by the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) possible sorrows on
our behalf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>It was agreed that on that afternoon Mary should write both to Mr.
Gilmore and to Janet Fenwick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) offered to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) letters, and
show them, when written, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) lover; but he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would
prefer not to see them. <div class="bookquote">``It is enough for me that I triumph,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) at once told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) aunt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would write the letters, and bring that to Mr. Gilmore to be
read by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) when they were finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would postpone it for awhile, if I were you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Sarah.

<p/>But Mary declared that any such delay would be unfair to Mr. Gilmore.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did write the letters before dinner, and they were as follows:--


<p/>MY DEAR MR. GILMORE,

<p/>When last you came down to the Vicarage to see me I
promised you, as you may perhaps remember, that if it
should come to pass that I should engage myself to any
other man, I would at once let you know that it was so. I
little thought then that I should so soon be called upon
to keep my promise. I will not pretend that the writing of
this letter is not very painful to me; but I know that it
is my duty to write it, and to put an end to a suspense
which you have been good enough to feel on my account. You
have, I think, heard the name of my cousin, Captain Walter
Marrable, who returned from India two or three months ago.
I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) staying here with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle, the clergyman,
and now I am engaged to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Perhaps it would be better that I should say nothing more
than this, and that I should leave myself and my character
and name to your future kindness,--or unkindness,--without
any attempt to win the former or to decry the latter; but
you have been to me ever so good and noble that I cannot
bring myself to be so cold and short. I have always felt
that your preference for me has been a great honour to
me. I have appreciated your esteem most highly, and have
valued your approbation more than I have been able to say.
If it could be possible that I should in future have your
friendship, I should value it more than that of any other
person. God bless you, Mr. Gilmore. I shall always hope
that you may be happy, and I shall hear with delight any
tidings which may seem to show that you are so.

<p/>Pray believe that I am
Your most sincere friend,

<p/>MARY LOWTHER.

<p/>I have thought it best to tell Janet Fenwick what I have
done.


<p/>Loring, Thursday.

<p/>DEAREST JANET,

<p/>I wonder what you will say to my news? But you must not
scold me. Pray do not scold me. It could never, never have
been as you wanted. I have engaged myself to marry my
cousin, Captain Walter Marrable, who is a nephew of Sir
Gregory Marrable, and a son of Colonel Marrable. We shall
be very poor, having not more than L300 a-year above his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
pay as a captain; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had nothing, I think I should
do the same. Do you remember how I used to doubt whether I
should ever have that sort of love for a man for which I
used to envy you? I don't envy you any longer, and I don't
regard Mr. Fenwick as being nearly so divine as I used to
do. I have a Jupiter of my own now, and need envy no woman
the reality of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love.

<p/>I have written to Mr. Gilmore by the same post as will
take this, and have just told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) the bare truth. What
else could I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)? I have said something horribly
stilted about esteem and friendship, which I would have
left out, only that my letter seemed to be heartless
without it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) has been to me as good as a man could be;
but was it my fault that I could not love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? If you knew
how I tried,--how I tried to make believe to myself that I
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); how I tried to teach myself that that sort of
very chill approbation was the nearest approach to love
that I could ever reach; and how I did this because you
bade me;--if you could understand all this, then you would
not scold me. And I did almost believe that it was so. But
now--! Oh, dear! how would it have been if I had engaged
myself to Mr. Gilmore, and that then Walter Marrable had
come to me! I get sick when I think how near I was to
saying that I would love a man whom I never could have
loved.

<p/>Of course I used to ask myself what I should do with
myself. I suppose every woman living has to ask and to
answer that question. I used to try to think that it would
be well not to think of the outer crust of myself. What
did it matter whether things were soft to me or not?
I could do my duty. And as this man was good, and a
gentleman, and endowed with high qualities and appropriate
tastes, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not have the wife he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted? I
thought that I could pretend to love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), till, after some
fashion, I should love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but as I think of it now, all
this seems to be so horrid! I know now what to do with
myself. To be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from head to foot! To feel that nothing
done for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be mean or distasteful! To stand at
a washtub and wash his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes, if it were wanted. Oh,
Janet, I used to dread the time in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have to
put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm round me and kiss me! I cannot tell you what I
feel now about that other he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>I know well how provoked you will be,--and it will all
come of love for me; but you cannot but own that I am
right. If you have any justice in you, write to me and
tell me that I am right.

<p/>Only that Mr. Gilmore is your great friend, and that,
therefore, just at first, Walter will not be your friend,
I would tell you more about him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>),--how handsome he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) is, how
manly, and how clever. And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) voice is like the
music of the spheres. You won't feel like being his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) friend
at first, but you must look forward to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) being your
friend; you must love him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)--as I do Mr. Fenwick; and you
must tell Mr. Fenwick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) must open his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) heart for the
man who is to be my husband. Alas, alas! I fear it will be
long before I can go to Bullhampton. How I do wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
would find some nice wife to suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)!

<p/>Good bye, dearest Janet. If you are really good, you will
write me a sweet, kind, loving letter, wishing me joy.
You must know all. Aunt Sarah has refused to congratulate
me, because the income is so small. Nevertheless, we have
not quarrelled. But the income will be nothing to you,
and I do look forward to a kind word. When everything is
settled, of course I will tell you.

<p/>Your most affectionate friend,

<p/>MARY LOWTHER.


<p/>The former letter of the two was shown to Miss Marrable. That lady
was of opinion that it should not be sent; but would not say that, if
to be sent, it could be altered for the better.




<p/>CHAPTER XXI.

<p/>WHAT PARSON JOHN THINKS ABOUT IT.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration-RSB-

<p/>On that same Thursday, the Thursday on which Mary Lowther wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
two despatches to Bullhampton, Miss Marrable sent a note down to
Parson John, requesting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) might have an interview with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
If he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) were at home and disengaged, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would go down to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that
evening, or he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might, if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pleased, come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). The former she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
thought would be preferable. Parson John assented, and very soon
after dinner the private brougham came round from the Dragon, and
conveyed Miss Marrable down to the rectory at Lowtown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going down to Parson John,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) to Mary. <div class="bookquote">``I think it best
to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) about the engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary received the information with a nod of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head that was
intended to be gracious, and Aunt Sarah proceeded on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) cousin alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) study, and immediately opened the
subject which had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) down the hill. <div class="bookquote">``Walter, I believe, has
told you about this engagement, Mr. Marrable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never was so astonished in my life! He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) told me last night. I had
begun to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was getting very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), but I didn't
suppose it would come to this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think it very imprudent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it's imprudent, Sarah. It don't require any thinking to
be aware of that. It's downright stupid;--two cousins with nothing
a year between them, when no doubt each of them might do very well.
They're well-born, and well-looking, and clever, and all that. It's
absurd, and I don't suppose it will ever come to anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you tell Walter what you thought?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) knows what I think without my telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>);
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) wouldn't care a pinch of snuff for my opinion. I tell you
because you ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But ought not something to be done to prevent it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can we do? I might tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) that I wouldn't have him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) here
any more, but I shouldn't like to do that. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll do your
bidding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear not, Mr. Marrable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you may be quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) won't do mine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)'ll go away and
forget her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). That'll be the end of it. It'll be as good as a year gone
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) life, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll lose this other lover of hers at--what's
the name of the place? It's a pity, but that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll have to go
through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) so light as that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>asked Aunt Sarah, shocked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)'s about the same as other men, I take it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll be the same
as other girls. They like to have their bit of fun now, and there'd
be no great harm,--only such fun costs the lady so plaguy dear. As
for their being married, I don't think Walter will ever be such a
fool as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something in this that was quite terrible to Aunt Sarah.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) Mary Lowther was to be treated in this way;--to be played with
as a plaything, and then to be turned off when the time for playing
came to an end! And this little game was to be played for Walter
Marrable's delectation, though the result of it would be the ruin of
Mary's prospects in life!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that if I believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) to be so base as that, I
would send him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) out of the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) does not mean to be base at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)'s just like the rest of 'em,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Parson John/John/Parson</b></font>)</div>said Parson John.

<p/>Aunt Sarah used every argument in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) power to show that something
should be done; but all to no purpose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) thought that if Sir
Gregory were brought to interfere, that perhaps might have an effect;
but the old clergyman laughed at this. What did Captain Walter
Marrable, who had been in the army all his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) life, and who had no
special favour to expect from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle, care about Sir Gregory? Head
of the family, indeed! What was the head of the family to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)? If
a girl would be a fool, the girl must take the result of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) folly.
That was Parson John's doctrine,--that and a confirmed assurance
that this engagement, such as it was, would lead to nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was
really very sorry for Mary, in whose praise he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said ever so many
good-natured things; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not been the first fool, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
would not be the last. It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) business, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) could do no
good by interfering. At last, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) did promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) would
himself speak to Walter. Nothing would come of it, but, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) cousin
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) nephew.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) waited for four-and-twenty hours before he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) spoke, and during that
time was subject to none of those terrors which were now making Miss
Marrable's life a burden to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). In his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) opinion it was almost a
pity that a young fellow like Walter should be interrupted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
amusement. According to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) view of life, very much wisdom was not
expected from ladies, young or old. They, for the most part, had
their bread found for them; and were not required to do anything,
whether they were rich or poor. Let them be ever so poor, the
disgrace of poverty did not fall upon them as it did upon men. But
then, if they would run their heads into trouble, trouble came harder
upon them than on men; and for that they had nobody to blame but
themselves. Of course it was a very nice thing to be in love. Verses
and pretty speeches and easy-spoken romance were pleasant enough in
their way. Parson John had no doubt tried them himself in early life,
and had found how far they were efficacious for his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own happiness.
But young women were so apt to want too much of the excitement! A
young man at Bullhampton was not enough without another young man at
Loring. That, we fear, was the mode in which Parson John looked at
the subject,--which mode of looking at it, had he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ever ventured to
explain it to Mary Lowther, would have brought down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head
from that young woman an amount of indignant scorn which would have
been very disagreeable to Parson John. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was a great deal
too wise to open his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mind on such a subject to Mary Lowther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, sir, I'd better go up and see Curling again next week,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say. Is anything not going right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I shall get the money, but I shall like to know when. I am
very anxious, of course, to fix a day for my marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not be over quick about that, if I were you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parson John/John/Parson</b></font>)</div>said Parson
John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? Situated as I am, I must be quick. I must make up my mind
at any rate where we're to live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll go back to your regiment, I suppose, next month?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. I shall go back to my regiment next month, unless we may
make up our minds to go out to India.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, you and Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I and Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As man and wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Parson John/John/Parson</b></font>)</div>said Parson John, with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How else should we go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) goes with you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must go as Mrs. Captain
Marrable, of course. But if I were you, I would not think of anything
so horrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be horrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div>said Walter Marrable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it would. India may be very well when a man is quite
young, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can keep himself from beer and wine; but to go back
there at your time of life with a wife, and to look forward to a
dozen children there, must be an unpleasant prospect, I should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div><p/>Walter Marrable sat silent and black.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should give up all idea of India,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the deuce is a man to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>asked the Captain.

<p/>The parson shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what I've been thinking of,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain. <div class="bookquote">``If I
could get a farm of four or five hundred acres--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A farm!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not a farm? I know that a man can do nothing with a farm unless
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has capital. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have L10 or L12 an acre for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) land, I
suppose. I should have that and some trifle of an income besides if
I sold out. I suppose my uncle would let me have a farm under him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'d see you--further first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't I do as well with a farm as another?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not turn shoemaker? Because you have not learned the business.
Farmer, indeed! You'd never get the farm, and if you did, you would
not keep it for three years. You've been in the army too long to be
fit for anything else, Walter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Marrable looked black and angry at being so counselled; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) believed what was said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), and had no answer to make to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must stick to the army,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>continued the old man; <div class="bookquote">``and if you'll
take my advice, you'll do so without the impediment of a wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's quite out of the question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it out of the question?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you ask me, Uncle John? Would you have me go back from an
engagement after I have made it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would have you go back from anything that was silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And tell a girl, after I have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be my wife, that I don't
want to have anything more to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that; but I should make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) understand, both
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own sake and for mine, that we had been too fast, and that
the sooner we gave up our folly the better for both of us. You can't
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), that's the truth of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll see if I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you choose to wait ten years, you may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't wait ten months, nor, if I can have my own way, ten weeks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>What a pity that Mary could not have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Half the fellows in
the army are married without anything beyond their pay; and I'm to
be told that we can't get along with L300 a year? At any rate, we'll
try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry in haste, and repent at leisure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``According to the doctrines that are going now-a-days,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the
Captain, <div class="bookquote">``it will be held soon that a gentleman can't marry unless
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has got L3000 a year. It is the most heartless, damnable teaching
that ever came up. It spoils the men, and makes women, when they do
marry, expect ever so many things that they ought never to want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you mean to teach them better, Walter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to act for myself, and not be frightened out of doing what I
think right, because the world says this and that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) so spoke, the angry Captain got up to leave the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson shot</b></font>)</div>rejoined the parson, firing the last shot; <div class="bookquote">``I'd think
twice about it, if I were you, before I married Mary Lowther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parson shot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)'s more of an ass, and twice as headstrong as I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Parson John/John/Parson</b></font>)</div>said
Parson John to Miss Marrable the next day; <div class="bookquote">``but still I don't think
it will come to anything. As far as I can observe, three of these
engagements are broken off for one that goes on. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) comes to
look at things he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)'ll get tired of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)'s going up to London next
week, and I shan't press him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) to come back. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) does come I can't
help it. If I were you, I wouldn't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) up the hill, and I should
tell Miss Mary a bit of my mind pretty plainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hitherto, as far as words went, Aunt Sarah had told very little of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mind to Mary Lowther on the subject of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) engagement, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
had spoken as yet no word of congratulation; and Mary knew that the
manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) proposed to bestow herself was not received with
favour by any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) relatives at Loring.




<p/>CHAPTER XXII.

<p/>WHAT THE FENWICKS THOUGHT ABOUT IT.


<p/>Bullhampton unfortunately was at the end of the postman's walk, and
as the man came all the way from Lavington, letters were seldom
received much before eleven o'clock. Now this was a most pernicious
arrangement, in respect to which Mr. Fenwick carried on a perpetual
feud with the Post-office authorities, having put forward a great
postal doctrine that letters ought to be rained from heaven on to
everybody's breakfast-table exactly as the hot water is brought in
for tea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), being an energetic man, carried on a long and angry
correspondence with the authorities aforesaid; but the old man
from Lavington continued to toddle into the village just at eleven
o'clock. It was acknowledged that ten was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) argued
with himself, ten and eleven were pretty much of a muchness. The
consequence of this was, that Mary Lowther's letters to Mrs. Fenwick
had been read by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) two or three hours before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had an opportunity
of speaking on the subject to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband. At last, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
returned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with the letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Frank,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Frank, what do you think has happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Bank of England must have stopped, from the look of your face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it had, with all my heart, sooner than this. Mary has gone
and engaged herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin, Walter Marrable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary Lowther!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; Mary Lowther! Our Mary! And from what I remember hearing about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is anything but nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had a lot of money left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't have been much, because Mary owns that they will be very
poor. Here is her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) letter. I am so unhappy about it. Don't you
remember hearing about that Colonel Marrable who was in a horrible
scrape about somebody's wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't judge the son from the father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've been in the army together, and they're both alike. I hate
the army. They are almost always no better than they should be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true, my dear, certainly of all services, unless it be the
army of martyrs; and there may be a doubt on the subject even as to
them. May I read it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has been half ashamed of herself every word she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has
written. I know her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so well. To think that Mary Lowther should have
engaged herself to any man after two days' acquaintance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Fenwick read the letter through attentively, and then handed it
back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a good letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that it's well written?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that it's true. There are no touches put in to make effect.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) does love the one man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) doesn't love the other. All I can
say is, that I'm very sorry for it. It will drive Gilmore out of the
place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, indeed. I never knew a man to be at the same time so strong
and so weak in such a matter. One would say that the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
affection would be the best pledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future happiness if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were
to marry the girl; but seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), one cannot
but feel that a man shouldn't stake his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happiness on a thing beyond
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think it is all up, then;--that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) really will marry this man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What else can I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These things do go off sometimes. There can't be much money,
because, you see, old Miss Marrable opposes the whole thing on
account of there not being income enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is anything but rich
herself, and is the last person of all the world to make a fuss about
money. If it could be broken off--.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I understand Mary Lowther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is not the
woman to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) match broken off for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) by any person. Of course I
know nothing about the man; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is firm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)'ll be as firm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) has written to Mr. Gilmore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all up with Harry as far as this goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick.

<p/>The Vicar had another matter of moment to discuss with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife. Sam
Brattle, after having remained hard at work at the mill for nearly a
fortnight,--so hard at work as to induce his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) father to declare that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'d bet a guinea there wasn't a man in the three parishes who could
come nigh his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Sam for a right down day's work;--after all this,
Sam had disappeared, had been gone for two days, and was said by
the constable to have been seen at night on the Devizes side, from
whence was supposed to come the Grinder, and all manner of Grinder's
iniquities. Up to this time no further arrest had been made on
account of Mr. Trumbull's murder, nor had any trace been found of the
Grinder, or of that other man who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion. The leading
policeman, who still had charge of the case, expressed himself as
sure that the old woman at Pycroft Common knew nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son's
whereabouts; but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had always declared, and still continued to
declare, that Sam Brattle could tell them the whole story of the
murder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) pleased, and there had been a certain amount of watching
kept on the young man, much to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own disgust, and to that of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
father. Sam had sworn aloud in the village--so much aloud that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had
shown his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) determination to be heard by all men--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would go to
America, and see whether anyone would dare to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had been
told of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) bail, and had replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would demand to be relieved
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) bail;--that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) bail was illegal, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would have it
all tried in a court of law. Mr. Fenwick had heard of this, and had
replied that as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was concerned he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was not in the least
afraid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) believed that the bail was illegal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) believed also
that Sam would stay where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was. But now Sam was gone, and the
Bullhampton constable was clearly of opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had gone to join
the Grinder. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s off somewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick,
<div class="bookquote">``and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother doesn't know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s gone. Old Brattle, of course,
won't say a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will it hurt you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not unless they get hold of those other fellows and require Sam's
appearance. I don't doubt but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'d turn up in that case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it does not signify?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It signifies for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). I've an idea that I know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'s gone, and
I think I shall go after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it far, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something short of Australia, luckily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Frank!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you the truth. It's my belief that Carry Brattle is living
about twenty miles off, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)'s gone to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carry Brattle!--down here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know it, and I don't want to hear it mentioned; but I fancy
it is so. At any rate, I shall go and see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor, dear, bright little Carry! But how is she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) living, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s not one of the army of martyrs, you may be sure. I daresay
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s no better than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll tell me if you see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I send her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The only thing to send her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is money. If she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is in want, I'll relieve
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),--with a very sparing hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you bring her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) back,--here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, who can say? I should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mother, and I suppose we should
have to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) father to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). I know what his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answer will
be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll refuse to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt. Then we should have to put our heads together, and the
chances are that the poor girl will be off in the meantime,--back to
London and the Devil. It is not easy to set crooked things straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite, however, of this interruption, Mary Lowther and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
engagement to Captain Marrable was the subject of greatest interest
at the Vicarage that day and through the night. Mrs. Fenwick half
expected that Gilmore would come down in the evening; but the Vicar
declared that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend would be unwilling to show himself after the
blow which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would have received. They knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would know that
they had received the news, and that therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could not come
either to tell it, or with the intention of asking questions without
telling it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) came at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) must come like a beaten cur with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) tail between his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) legs. And then there arose the question whether
it would not be better that Mary's letter should be answered before
Mr. Gilmore was seen. Mrs. Fenwick, whose fingers were itching for
pen and paper, declared at last that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would write at once; and did
write, as follows, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) went to bed:--


<p/>The Vicarage, Friday.

<p/>DEAREST MARY,

<p/>I do not know how to answer your letter. You tell me to
write pleasantly, and to congratulate you; but how is one
to do that so utterly in opposition to one's own interests
and wishes? Oh dear, oh dear! how I do so wish you had
stayed at Bullhampton! I know you will be angry with me
for saying so, but how can I say anything else? I cannot
picture you to myself going about from town to town and
living in country-quarters. And as I never saw Captain
Marrable, to the best of my belief, I cannot interest
myself about him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) as I do about one whom I know and love
and esteem. I feel that this is not a nice way of writing
to you, and indeed I would be nice if I could. Of course
I wish you to be full of joy;--of course I wish with all
my heart that you may be happy if you marry your cousin;
but the thing has come so suddenly that we cannot bring
ourselves to look upon it as a reality.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should speak for yourself, Janet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
came to this part of the letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not, however, require that
the sentence should be altered.


<p/>You talk so much of doing what is right! Nobody has ever
doubted that you were right both in morals and sentiment.
The only regret has been that such a course should be
right, and that the other thing should be wrong. Poor man!
we have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yet, nor heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Frank says
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will take it very badly. I suppose that men do
always get over that kind of thing much quicker than women
do. Many women never can get over it at all; and Harry
Gilmore, though there is so little about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) that seems to
be soft, is in this respect more like a woman than a man.
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been otherwise, and had only half cared for you,
and asked you to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife as though your taking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
were a thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't much care about, and were quite
a matter of course, I believe you would have been up at
Hampton Privets this moment, instead of going soldiering
with a captain.

<p/>Frank bids me send you his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) kindest love and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) best
wishes for your happiness. Those are his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) very words, and
they seem to be kinder than mine. Of course you have my
love and my best wishes; but I do not know how to write as
though I could rejoice with you. Your husband will always
be dear to us, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may be, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) be good to you.
At present I feel very, very angry with Captain Marrable;
as though I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) head blown off in battle.
However, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is to be the happy man, I will open my
heart to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>);--that is, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) be good.

<p/>I know this is not nice, but I cannot make it nicer now.
God bless you, dearest Mary.

<p/>Ever your most affectionate friend,

<p/>JANET FENWICK.


<p/>The letter was not posted till the hour for despatch on the following
day; but, up to that hour, nothing had been seen at the Vicarage of
Mr. Gilmore.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIII.

<p/>WHAT MR. GILMORE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.


<p/>Mr. Gilmore was standing on the doorsteps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own house when
Mary's letter was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). It was a modest-sized country
gentleman's residence, built of variegated uneven stones, black and
grey and white, which seemed to be chiefly flint; but the corners
and settings of the windows and of the door-ways, and the chimneys,
were of brick. There was something sombre about it, and many perhaps
might call it dull of aspect; but it was substantial, comfortable,
and unassuming. It was entered by broad stone steps, with iron
balustrades curving outwards as they descended, and there was an open
area round the house, showing that the offices were in the basement.
In these days it was a quiet house enough, as Mr. Gilmore was a man
not much given to the loudness of bachelor parties. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entertained
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbours at dinner perhaps once a month, and occasionally
had a few guests staying with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle, the prebendary from
Salisbury, was often with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and occasionally a brother who was in
the army. For the present, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was much more inclined, when
in want of society, to walk off to the Vicarage than to provide it
for himself at home. When Mary's letter was handed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``Times''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and other correspondence, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked, as everybody does, at
the address, and at once knew that it came from Mary Lowther. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had never hitherto received a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), but yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
handwriting well. Without waiting a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heel,
and went back into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, and through the hall to the library.
When there, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first opened three other letters, two from tradesmen
in London, and one from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle, offering to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the
next Monday. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened the <div class="bookquote">``Times,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and cut it, and put it down
on the table. Mary's letter meanwhile was in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and anyone
standing by might have thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forgotten it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had not forgotten it, nor was it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind for a moment.
While looking at the other letters, while cutting the paper, while
attempting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, to read the news, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was suffering under the
dread of the blow that was coming. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was there for twenty minutes
before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dared to break the envelope; and though during the whole of
that time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pretended to deceive himself by some employment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was simply postponing an evil thing that was coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cut the letter open, and stood for some moments looking
for courage to read it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did read it, and then sat himself down in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair, telling himself that the thing was over, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
bear it as a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) newspaper, and began to study it. It
was the time of the year when newspapers are not very interesting,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made a rush at the leading articles, and went through two of
them. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned over to the police reports. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat there for an
hour, and read hard during the whole time. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up and shook
himself, and knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a crippled man, with every function out
of order, disabled in every limb. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked from the library into the
hall, and thence to the dining-room, and so, backwards and forwards,
for a quarter of an hour. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could walk no longer, and,
closing the door of the library behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw himself on a
sofa and cried like a woman.

<p/>What was it that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted, and why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) want it? Were there not
other women whom the world would say were as good? Was it ever known
that a man had died, or become irretrievably broken and destroyed by
disappointed love? Was it not one of those things that a man should
shake off from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and have done with it? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked himself these,
and many such-like questions, and tried to philosophise with himself
on the matter. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no will of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might conquer
this enemy? No; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no will of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, and the enemy would not be
conquered. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to tell himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so poor a thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could not stand up against the evil that had fallen on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked out round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shrubberies and paddocks, and tried to take
an interest in the bullocks and the horses. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that if every
bullock and horse about the place had been struck dead it would not
enhance his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misery. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not had much hope before, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
have seen the house of Hampton Privets in flames, just for the chance
that had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) yesterday. It was not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>), or
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) regretted the absence of some recognised joys which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) would
have brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>); but that the final decision on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) part seemed
to take from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) all vitality, all power of enjoyment, all that
inward elasticity which is necessary for an interest in worldly
affairs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) had as yet hardly thought of anything but himself;--had hardly
observed the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) successful rival, or paid any attention to
aught but the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) that it was all over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>)
had not attempted to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) mind whether anything could still
be done, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) might yet have a chance, whether it would be
well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) to quarrel with the man; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) should be indignant
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>), or remonstrate once again in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) cruelty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) had
thought only of the blow, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) inability to support it. Would
it not be best that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) should go forth, and blow out his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) brains, and
have done with it?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) did not look at the letter again till he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) had returned to the
library. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) took it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) pocket, and read it very carefully.
Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) had been quick about it. Why; how long had it been since she (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>)
had left their parish? It was still October, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) had been there
just before the murder--only the other day! Captain Walter Marrable!
No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) didn't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had ever heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). Some fellow with a
moustache and a military strut--just the man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had always
hated; one of a class which, with nothing real to recommend it, is
always interfering with the happiness of everybody. It was in some
such light as this that Mr. Gilmore at present regarded Captain
Marrable. How could such a man make a woman happy,--a fellow who
probably had no house nor home in which to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comfortable?
Staying with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle the clergyman! Poor Gilmore expressed a
wish that the uncle the clergyman had been choked before he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had
entertained such a guest. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) read the concluding sentence of
poor Mary's letter, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) expressed a hope that they might be
friends. Was there ever such cold-blooded trash? Friends indeed! What
sort of friendship could there be between two persons, one of whom
had made the other so wretched,--so dead as was he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) at present!

<p/>For some half-hour he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) tried to comfort himself with an idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
could get hold of Captain Marrable and maul him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>); that it would be a
thing permissible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), a magistrate, to go forth with a whip and
flog the man, and then perhaps shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), because the man had been
fortunate in love where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been unfortunate. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the
world in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived too well to allow himself long to think that
this could really be done. It might be that it would be a better
world were such revenge practicable in it; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) well knew, it
was not practicable now, and if Mary Lowther chose to give herself to
this accursed Captain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could not help it. There was nothing that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could do but to go away and chafe at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) suffering in some part of
the world in which nobody would know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was chafing.

<p/>When the evening came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) solitude was terribly
oppressive to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would go down to the Vicarage.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been told by that false one that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) tidings had been sent to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hat and sauntered out across the fields, and
did walk as far as the churchyard gate close to poor Mr. Trumbull's
farm, the very spot on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) had last seen Mary Lowther; but when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was there he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) could not endure to go through to the Vicarage. There
is something mean to a man in the want of success in love. If a
man lose a venture of money he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend; or if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be
unsuccessful in trying for a seat in parliament; or be thrown out of
a run in the hunting-field; or even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be blackballed for a club;
but a man can hardly bring himself to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dearest comrade that
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Mary has preferred another man to himself. This wretched fact
the Fenwicks already knew as to poor Gilmore's Mary; and yet, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had come down there, hoping for some comfort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) did not dare to
face them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) went back all alone, and tumbled and tossed and fretted
through the miserable night.

<p/>And the next morning was as bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) hung about the place till about
four, utterly crushed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) burden. It was a Saturday, and when the
postman called no letter had yet been even written in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>)
uncle's proposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) was moping about the grounds, with his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) hands
in his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) pockets, thinking of this, when suddenly Mrs. Fenwick appeared
in the path before him (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>). There had been another consultation that
morning between herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband, and this visit was the
result of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dashed at the matter immediately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to talk to me about Mary Lowther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come to say a word, if I can, to comfort you. Frank bade me
to come.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't any comfort,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We knew that it would be hard to bear, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said, putting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) hand within his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arm; <div class="bookquote">``but there is comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be none for me. I had set my heart upon it so that I
cannot forget it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you had, and so had we. Of course there will be sorrow, but
it will wear off.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head without speaking. <div class="bookquote">``God is too
good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``to let such troubles remain with us long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that there is no chance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>What could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) say to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? How, under the circumstances of Mary's
engagement, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) encourage his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that there is none,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``I feel, Mrs. Fenwick,
that I do not know what to do with myself or how to hold myself. Of
course it is nonsense to talk about dying, but I do feel as though if
I didn't die I should go crazy. I can't settle my mind to a single
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is fresh with you yet, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never called him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
Harry before, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband did so always, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) used the
name in sheer tenderness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why such a thing should be different with me than with
other people,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``only perhaps I am weaker. But I've known
from the very first that I have staked everything upon her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I have
never questioned to myself that I was going for all or nothing.
I have seen it before me all along, and now it has come. Oh, Mrs.
Fenwick, if God would strike me dead this moment, it would be a
mercy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) threw himself on the ground at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
not there a moment before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was up again. <div class="bookquote">``If you knew how I despise
myself for all this, how I hate myself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), but stayed there till he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) consented to come
down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to the Vicarage. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should dine there, and Frank
should walk back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) at night. As to that question of Mr.
Chamberlaine's visit, respecting which Mrs. Fenwick did not feel
herself competent to give advice herself, it should become matter of
debate between them and Frank, and then a man and horse could be sent
to Salisbury on Sunday morning. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked down to the Vicarage
with that pretty woman at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow, things perhaps were a little
better with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XXIV.

<p/>THE REV. HENRY FITZACKERLEY CHAMBERLAINE.


<p/>It was decided that evening at the Vicarage that it would be better
for all parties that the reverend uncle from Salisbury should be told
to make his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) visit, and spend the next week at Hampton Privets; that
is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) should come on the Monday and stay till the Saturday.
The letter was written down at the Vicarage, as Fenwick feared that
it would never be written if the writing of it were left to the
unassisted energy of the Squire. The letter was written, and the
Vicar, who walked back to Hampton Privets with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend, took care
that it was given to a servant on that night.

<p/>On the Sunday nothing was seen of Mr. Gilmore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) did not come to
church, nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) dine at the Vicarage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) remained the whole day
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own house, pretending to write, trying to read, with accounts
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), with a magazine in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) hand, even with a volume of
sermons open on the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). But neither the accounts, nor
the magazines, nor the sermons, could arrest his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) attention for a
moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had staked everything on obtaining a certain object, and
that object was now beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) reach. Men fail often in other things,
in the pursuit of honour, fortune, or power, and when they fail they
can begin again. There was no beginning again for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). When Mary
Lowther should have married this captain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would be a thing lost
to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) for ever;--and was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) not as bad as married to this man
already? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do nothing to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) marriage.

<p/>Early in the afternoon of Monday the Rev. Henry Fitzackerley
Chamberlaine reached Hampton Privets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) came with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) own carriage
and a pair of post-horses, as befitted a prebendary of the good
old times. Not that Mr. Chamberlaine was a very old man, but that
it suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) tastes and tone of mind to adhere to the well-bred
ceremonies of life, so many of which went out of fashion when
railroads came in. Mr. Chamberlaine was a gentleman of about
fifty-five years of age, unmarried, possessed of a comfortable
private independence, the incumbent of a living in the fens of
Cambridgeshire, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) never visited,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) health forbidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>)
to do so,--on which subject there had been a considerable amount of
correspondence between him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) and a certain right rev. prelate, in which
the prebendary had so far got the better in the argument as not to be
disturbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) manner of life; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was, as has been before said,
the owner of a stall in Salisbury Cathedral. His (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) lines had certainly
fallen to him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) in very pleasant places. As to that living in the
fens, there was not much to prick his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) conscience, as he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) gave up the
parsonage house and two-thirds of the income to his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) curate, expending
the other third on local charities. Perhaps the argument which
had most weight in silencing the bishop was contained in a short
postscript to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) letters. <div class="bookquote">``By-the-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the postscript,
<div class="bookquote">``perhaps I ought to inform your lordship that I have never drawn
a penny of income out of Hardbedloe since I ceased to live there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's a bishop's living,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the happy holder of it, <div class="bookquote">``to one or two
clerical friends, and Dr. -- thinks the patronage would be better
in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) hands than in mine. I disagree with him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)'ll have to
write a great many letters before he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) succeeds.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) stall was
worth L800 a year and a house, and Mr. Chamberlaine, in regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>)
money matters, was quite in clover.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was a very handsome man, about six feet high, with large light
grey eyes, a straight nose, and a well cut chin. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) lips were thin,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) teeth were perfect,--only that they had been supplied by a
dentist. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) grey hair encircled his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) head, coming round upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>)
forehead in little wavy curls, in a manner that had conquered the
hearts of spinsters by the dozen in the cathedral. It was whispered,
indeed, that married ladies would sometimes succumb, and rave about
the beauty, and the dignity, and the white hands, and the deep
rolling voice of the Rev. Henry Fitzackerley Chamberlaine. Indeed,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) voice was very fine when it would be heard from the far-off end
of the choir during the communion service, altogether trumping the
exertion of the other second-rate clergyman who would be associated
with him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) at the altar. And he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had, too, great gifts of preaching,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) would exercise once a week during thirteen weeks of the
year. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) never exceeded twenty-five minutes; every word was audible
throughout the whole choir, and there was a grace about it that was
better than any doctrine. When he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was to be heard the cathedral was
always full, and he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was perhaps justified in regarding himself as one
of the ecclesiastical stars of the day. Many applications were made
to him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) to preach here and there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) always refused. Stories
were told of how he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had declined to preach before the Queen at
St. James's, averring that if Her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) Majesty would please to visit
Salisbury, every accommodation should be provided for her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>). As to
preaching at Whitehall, Westminster, and St. Paul's, it was not
doubted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had over and over again declared that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) appointed
place was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own stall, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not consider that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
called to holding forth in the market-place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was usually abroad
during the early autumn months, and would make sundry prolonged
visits to friends; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) only home was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) prebendal residence in
the Close. It was not much of a house to look at from the outside,
being built with the plainest possible construction of brick; but
within it was very pleasant. All that curtains, and carpets, and
armchairs, and books, and ornaments could do, had been done lavishly,
and the cellar was known to be the best in the city. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) always used
post-horses, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) never talked very much,
but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did speak people listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) appetite was
excellent, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was a feeder not very easy to please; it was
understood well by the ladies of Salisbury that if Mr. Chamberlaine
was expected to dinner, something special must be done in the way of
entertainment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was always exceedingly well dressed. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) did
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) hours nobody knew, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was supposed to be a man well
educated at all points. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was such a judge of all works of
art, that not another like him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was to be found in Wiltshire, nobody
doubted. It was considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was almost as big as the bishop,
and not a soul in Salisbury would have thought of comparing the dean
to him (<font color='blue'><b>dean</b></font>). But the dean had seven children, and Mr. Chamberlaine was
quite unencumbered.

<p/>Henry Gilmore was a little afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) uncle, but would always
declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was not so. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) chooses to come over here he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is
welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>the nephew would say; <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) must live just as I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>Nevertheless, though there was but little left of the '47 Lafitte in
the cellar of Hampton Privets, a bottle was always brought up when
Mr. Chamberlaine was there, and Mrs. Bunker, the cook, did not
pretend but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bunker</b></font>) was in a state of dismay from the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>)
coming to that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) going. And yet, Mrs. Bunker and the other
servants liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) to be there. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) presence honoured the Privets.
Even the boy who blacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) boots felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was blacking the
boots of a great man. It was acknowledged throughout the household
that the Squire having such an uncle, was more of a Squire than he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
would have been without him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). The clergyman, being such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was, was
greater than the country gentleman. And yet Mr. Chamberlaine was only
a prebendary, was the son of a country clergyman who had happened
to marry a wife with money, and had absolutely never done anything
useful in the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) life. It is often very curious to
trace the sources of greatness. With Mr. Chamberlaine, I think it
came from the whiteness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) hands, and from a certain knack he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>)
had of looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) could say a great deal, though it suited
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) better to be silent, and say nothing. Of outside deportment, no
doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was a master.

<p/>Mr. Fenwick always declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was very fond of Mr.
Chamberlaine, and greatly admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is the most perfect
philosopher I ever met,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Fenwick would say, <div class="bookquote">``and has gone to the very
centre depth of contemplation. In another ten years he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) will be the
great Akinetos. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) will eat and drink, and listen, and be at ease,
and desire nothing. As it is, no man that I know disturbs other
people so little.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>On the other hand, Mr. Chamberlaine did not
profess any great admiration for Mr. Fenwick, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) designated
as one of the smart <div class="bookquote">``windbag tribe, clever, no doubt, and perhaps
conscientious, but shallow and perhaps a little conceited.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The
Squire, who was not clever and not conceited, understood them both,
and much preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) friend the Vicar to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) uncle the prebendary.

<p/>Gilmore had once consulted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) uncle,--once in an evil moment, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) now felt,--whether it would not be well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) to marry Miss
Lowther. The uncle had expressed himself as very adverse to the
marriage, and would now, on this occasion, be sure to ask some
question about it. When the great man arrived the Squire was out,
still wandering round among the bullocks and sheep; but the evening
after dinner would be very long. On the following day Mr. and Mrs.
Fenwick, with Mr. and Mrs. Greenthorne, were to dine at the Privets.
If this first evening were only through, Gilmore thought that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could get some comfort, even from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) uncle. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) came near
the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) went into the yard, and saw the Prebendary's grand
carriage, which was being washed. No; as far as the groom knew, Mr.
Chamberlaine had not gone out; but was in the house then. So Gilmore
entered, and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) uncle in the library.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) first questions were about the murder. <div class="bookquote">``You did catch one man,
and let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Prebendary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; a tenant of mine; but there was no evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
not the man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not have let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chamberlaine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not have kept a man that was innocent?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not have let the young man go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the law would not support us in detaining him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless, I would not have let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chamberlaine.
<div class="bookquote">``I heard all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From whom did you hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From Lord Trowbridge. I certainly would not have let him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>It
appeared, however, that Lord Trowbridge's opinion had been given to
the Prebendary prior to that fatal meeting which had taken place in
the house of the murdered man.

<p/>The uncle drank his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) claret in silence on this evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said
nothing, at least, about Mary Lowther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know where you got it, Harry, but that is not a bad glass of
wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We think there's none better in the country, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Gilmore/Gilmore</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very sorry to commit myself so far; but it is a good
glass of wine. By the bye, I hope your chef has learned to make a
cup of coffee since I was here in the spring. I think we will try it
now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The coffee was brought, and the Prebendary shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head,--the
least shake in the world,--and smiled blandly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coffee is the very devil in the country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Gilmore/Gilmore</b></font>)</div>said Harry Gilmore, who
did not dare to say that the mixture was good in opposition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
uncle's opinion.

<p/>After the coffee, which was served in the library, the two men sat
silent together for half an hour, and Gilmore was endeavouring to
think what it was that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) uncle come to Bullhampton. At last,
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had arrived at any decision on this subject, there came
first a little nod, then a start and a sweet smile, then another nod
and a start without the smile, and, after that, a soft murmuring of a
musical snore, which gradually increased in deepness till it became
evident that the Prebendary was extremely happy. Then it occurred to
Gilmore that perhaps Mr. Chamberlaine might become tired of going to
sleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) own house, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) had come to the Privets, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>)
could not do so with comfortable self-satisfaction in the houses
of indifferent friends. For the benefit of such a change it might
perhaps be worth the great man's while to undergo the penalty of a
bad cup of coffee.

<p/>And could not he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, go to sleep,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Gilmore? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) not fall
asleep,--not only for a few moments on such an occasion as this,--but
altogether, after the Akinetos fashion, as explained by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend
Fenwick? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) not become an immoveable one, as was this divine
uncle of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)? No Mary Lowther had ever disturbed that man's
happiness. A good dinner, a pretty ring, an easy chair, a china
tea-cup, might all be procured with certainty, as long as money
lasted. Here was a man before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) superbly comfortable, absolutely
happy, with no greater suffering than what might come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from a
chance cup of bad coffee, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Harry Gilmore himself, was as
miserable a devil as might be found between the four seas, because a
certain young woman wouldn't come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) and take half of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
owned! If there were any curative philosophy to be found, why could
not he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) find it? The world might say that the philosophy was a low
philosophy; but what did that matter, if it would take away out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) breast that horrid load which was more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could bear?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) declared to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would sell his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) heart with all its
privileges for half-a-farthing, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could find anybody to take it
with all its burden. Here, then, was a man who had no burden. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
snoring with almost harmonious cadence,--slowly, discreetly,--one
might say, artistically, quite like a gentleman; and the man who so
snored could not but be happy. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, d--n it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore, in a
private whisper, getting up and leaving the room; but there was more
of envy than of anger in the exclamation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you've been out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chamberlaine, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) nephew
returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Been to look at the horses made up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never can see the use of that; but I believe a great many men
do it. I suppose it's an excuse for smoking generally.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>Now, Mr.
Chamberlaine did not smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; I did light my pipe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not the slightest necessity for telling me so, Harry. Let us
see if Mrs. Bunker's tea is better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Bunker</b></font>) coffee.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>Then the bell
was rung, and Mr. Chamberlaine desired that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) might have a cup of
black tea, not strong, but made with a good deal of tea, and poured
out rapidly, without much decoction. <div class="bookquote">``If it be strong and harsh I
can't sleep a wink,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) said. The tea was brought, and sipped very
leisurely. There was then a word or two said about certain German
baths from which Mr. Chamberlaine had just returned; and Mr. Gilmore
began to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) should not be asked to say anything about
Mary Lowther that night.

<p/>But the Fates were not so kind. The Prebendary had arisen with the
intention of retiring for the night, and was already standing before
the fire, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) bedroom candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) hand, when something,--the
happiness probably of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own position in life, which allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) to
seek the blessings of an undivided couch,--brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) memory the
fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) nephew had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) about some young woman, some
young woman who had possessed not even the merit of a dowry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what has become of that flame of yours,
Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Harry Gilmore became black and glum. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) did not like to hear
Mary spoken of as a flame. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was standing at this moment with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) uncle, and so remained, without answering him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you
mean to say that you did not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Bunker</b></font>), after all?''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>asked the uncle.
<div class="bookquote">``If there be any scrape, Harry, you had better let me hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you call a scrape,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Gilmore/Gilmore</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bunker</b></font>)'s not going
to marry me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>Gilmore turned round, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) uncle did
not probably see his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I can assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>continued Mr.
Chamberlaine, <div class="bookquote">``that the idea made me quite uncomfortable. I set some
inquiries on foot, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bunker</b></font>) was not the sort of girl that you should
marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By G--,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore, <div class="bookquote">``I'd give every acre I have in the world,
and every shilling, and every friend, and twenty years of my life, if
I could only be allowed at this moment to think it possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bunker</b></font>)
would ever marry me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chamberlaine. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was saying it, Harry
Gilmore walked off, and did not show himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) uncle again that
night.




<p/>CHAPTER XXV.

<p/>CARRY BRATTLE.


<p/>On the day after the dinner-party at Hampton Privets Mr. Fenwick made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) little excursion out in the direction towards Devizes, of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had spoken to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife. The dinner had gone off very quietly, and
there was considerable improvement in the coffee. There was some
gentle sparring between the two clergymen, if that can be called
sparring in which all the active pugnacity was on one side. Mr.
Fenwick endeavoured to entrap Mr. Chamberlaine into arguments, but
the Prebendary escaped with a degree of skill,--without the shame of
sullen refusal,--that excited the admiration of Mr. Fenwick's wife.
<div class="bookquote">``After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is a clever man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went home, <div class="bookquote">``or he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
could never slip about as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does, like an eel, and that with so very
little motion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On the next morning the Vicar started alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) gig. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had
at first said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would take with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) a nondescript boy, who
was partly groom, partly gardener, and partly shoeblack, and who
consequently did half the work of the house; but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) decided
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would go alone. <div class="bookquote">``Peter is very silent, and most meritoriously
uninterested in everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wouldn't tell
much, but even he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) might tell something.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) got himself into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) gig, and drove off alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) took the Devizes road, and passed
through Lavington without asking a question; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was half way
between that place and Devizes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) horse at a lane that
led away to the right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been on the road before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) did
not know that lane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) waited awhile till an old woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) saw
coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whether the lane would take
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) across to the Marlborough Road. The old woman knew nothing of
the Marlborough Road, and looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never heard of
Marlborough. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) asked the way to Pycroft Common. Yes; the lane
would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) to Pycroft Common. Would it take him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) to the Bald-faced
Stag? The old woman said it would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) to Rump End Corner,
<div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bunker</b></font>) didn't know nowt o' t`other place.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) took the lane,
however, and without much difficulty made his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) way to the Bald-faced
Stag,--which, in the days of the glory of that branch of the Western
Road, used to supply beer to at least a dozen coaches a-day, but
which now, alas! could slake no drowth but that of the rural
aborigines. At the Bald-faced Stag, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could
get a feed of corn, and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) horse,--and saw the corn
eaten.

<p/>Pycroft Common was a mile from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), and to Pycroft Common he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) walked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) took the road towards Marlborough for half a mile, and then broke
off across the open ground to the left. There was no difficulty in
finding this place, and now it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) object to discover the cottage
of Mrs. Burrows without asking the neighbours for her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) by name. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had
obtained a certain amount of information, and thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could
act on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) walked on to the middle of the common, and looked for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) points of bearing. There was the beer-house, and there was the
lane that led away to Pewsey, and there were the two brick cottages
standing together. Mrs. Burrows lived in the little white cottage
just behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) walked straight up to the door, between the
sunflowers and the rose-bush, and, pausing for a few moments to think
whether or no he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would enter the cottage unannounced, knocked at the
door. A policeman would have entered without doing so,--and so would
a poacher knock over a hare on its form; but whatever creature a
gentleman or a sportsman be hunting, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will always give it a chance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) rapped, and immediately heard that there were sounds within. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
rapped again, and in about a minute was told to enter. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) opened
the door, and found but one person within. It was a young woman, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stood for a moment looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Carry Brattle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad that I have found you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laws, Mr. Fenwick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carry, I am so glad to see you;'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Fenwick, I ain't fit for the likes of you to touch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said. But as his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand was still stretched out she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own into
it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) held it in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grasp for a few seconds. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a poor,
sickly-looking thing now, but there were the remains of great beauty
in the face,--or rather, the presence of beauty, but of beauty
obscured by flushes of riotous living and periods of want, by
ill-health, harsh usage, and, worst of all, by the sharp agonies of
an intermittent conscience. It was a pale, gentle face, on which
there were still streaks of pink,--a soft, laughing face it had been
once, and still there was a gleam of light in the eyes that told of
past merriment, and almost promised mirth to come, if only some great
evil might be cured. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) long flaxen curls still hung down her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) face,
but they were larger, and, as Fenwick thought, more tawdry than of
yore; and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cheeks were thin, and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes were hollow; and then
there had come across her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mouth that look of boldness which the use
of bad, sharp words, half-wicked and half-witty, will always give.
She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was dressed decently, and was sitting in a low chair, with a
torn, disreputable-looking old novel in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand. Fenwick knew that
the book had been taken up on the spur of the moment, as there had
certainly been someone there when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had knocked at the door.

<p/>And yet, though vice had laid its heavy hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), the glory
and the brightness, and the sweet outward flavour of innocence, had
not altogether departed from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). Though her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mouth was bold, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
eyes were soft and womanly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looked up into the face of the
clergyman with a gentle, tamed, beseeching gaze, which softened and
won his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) heart at once. Not that his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) heart had ever been hard against
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). Perhaps it was a fault with him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) never hardened his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) heart
against a sinner, unless the sin implied pretence and falsehood.
At this moment, remembering the little Carry Brattle of old, who
had sometimes been so sweetly obedient, and sometimes so wilful,
under his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) hands, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had petted, and caressed, and scolded, and
loved,--whom he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had loved undoubtedly in part because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had been so
pretty,--whom he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) might live to marry to some good
farmer, in whose kitchen he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) would ever be welcome, and whose children
he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) would christen;--remembering all this, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) would now, at this
moment, have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) arms and embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) dared,
showing her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) did not account her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to be vile, begging her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to
become more good, and planning some course for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) future life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come across from Bullhampton, Carry, to find you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a poor place you're come to, Mr. Fenwick. I suppose the police
told you of my being here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had heard of it. Tell me, Carry, what do you know of Sam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of Sam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--of Sam. Don't tell me an untruth. You need tell me nothing, you
know, unless you like. I don't come to ask as having any authority,
only as a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) paused a moment before she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Sam hasn't done any harm to
nobody,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) has. I only want to know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) is. You can
understand, Carry, that it would be best that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) should be at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) paused again, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) blurted out her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) answer. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) went out
o' that back door, Mr. Fenwick, when you came in at t`other.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div>The
Vicar immediately went to the back door, but Sam, of course, was not
to be seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) be hiding if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has done no harm?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought it was one of them police. They do be coming here a`most
every day, till one's heart faints at seeing 'em. I'd go away if I'd
e'er a place to go to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you no place at home, Carry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; no place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This was so true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) couldn't tell himself why he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had asked the
question. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) certainly had no place at home till her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father's heart
should be changed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Carry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), speaking very slowly, <div class="bookquote">``they tell me that you are
married. Is that true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would tell me, if you can. The state of a married woman
is honest at any rate, let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband be who he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My state is not honest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not married, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hardly knew how to go on with this interrogation, or to ask
questions about her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) past and present life, without expressing a
degree of censure which, at any rate for the present, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wished to
repress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are living here, I believe, with old Mrs. Burrows?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was told that you were married to her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They told you untrue, sir. I know nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) son, except just to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that true, Carry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true. It wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was it, Carry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) son;--but what does it signify? He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s gone away, and I shall

won't talk about un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was not your husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Fenwick; I never had a husband, nor never shall, I suppose.
What man would take the likes of me? I have just got one thing to do,
and that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What thing is that, Carry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To die and have done with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, bursting out into loud
sobs. <div class="bookquote">``What's the use o' living? Nobody 'll see me, or speak to me.
Ain't I just so bad that they'd hang me if they knew how to catch
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Fenwick, thinking for the moment that
from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) words she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), too, might have had some part in the murder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't the police coming here after me a`most every day? And when

And where can I go out o' this? I don't want to be living here always
with that old woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is the old woman, Carry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you knows, Mr. Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Burrows, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) is the mother of the

they accuse of the murder?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Yet again she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``There was
another man?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nodded it again. <div class="bookquote">``And they say that there was a

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then they lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shouted, jumping up from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">``They lie

Mr. Fenwick could not help joining this terribly earnest threat and
the Marquis of Trowbridge together in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) imagination. <div class="bookquote">``Sam hadn't no

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; because you're good, and kind, and don't think ill of poor folk

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not come here, however, to talk about the murder, Carry. If I

ought to be at home. Why has he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) home and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) work while his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)

me, I ain't no business to speak of nobody. How should I know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
comes and why he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) goes? If I said as how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'d come to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) sister,
it wouldn't sound true, would it, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) being what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) got up and went to the front door, and opened it, and looked about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was looking for nothing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) eyes were full of tears, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) didn't care to wipe the drops away in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Carry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said, coming back to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it wasn't all for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that I

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For who else, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember how we loved you when you were young, Carry? Do you
remember my wife, and how you used to come and play with the children

one or two at Bullhampton who never will forget it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody loves me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, talking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shoulder,
which was turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought for a moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) that the Lord loved
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); but there was something human at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) heart, something perhaps
too human, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) feel that were he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) down low upon the ground,
some love that was nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), some love that was more easily
intelligible, which had been more palpably felt, would in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) frailty
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wickedness be of more immediate avail to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) than the love
even of the Lord God.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you think that, Carry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I am bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we were to love only the good, we should love very few. I love

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father would kill me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.

would not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not comprehend the extent
of the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) question. <div class="bookquote">``If it be so, and if you will not

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked no further questions about herself, but reverted to the
subject of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brother. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bring him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in to say a few words to
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) old friend? But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was gone, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did
not know whither; that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might probably return this very day to the
mill, having told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) purpose to do so soon. When he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
expressed a hope that Sam held no consort with those bad men who had
murdered and robbed Mr. Trumbull, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) with such naive
assurance that any such consorting was out of the question, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
became at once convinced that the murderers were far away, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew that such was the case. As far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) could learn from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
Sam had really been over to Pycroft with the view of seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
sister, taking probably a holiday of a day or two on the way. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
again reverted to herself, having as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) thought obtained a favourable
answer to that vital question which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you nothing to ask of your mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sam has told me of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and of Fan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And would you not care to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Care, Mr. Fenwick! Wouldn't I give my eyes to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? But how can

spoke to me. Sometimes I think I'll walk there all the day, and so
get there at night, and just look about the old place, only I know
I'd drown myself in the mill-stream. I wish I had. I wish it was
done. I've seed an old poem in which they thought much of a poor girl
after she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was drowned, though nobody wouldn't think nothing at all

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't drown yourself, Carry, and I'll care for you. Keep your

no answer. <div class="bookquote">``I will not ask you for a spoken promise, but make it

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't forget them. You can begin again. And now I must ask

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wheresoever I may send for you? Do you think that I would have you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it'd be--for a prison; or to live along with a lot of
others. Oh, Mr. Fenwick, I could not stand that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) did not dare to proceed any further lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) should be tempted to
make promises which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) himself could not perform; but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) an assurance before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) went that if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) present abode
within a month, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) know whither she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was going.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) went to the Bald-faced Stag and got his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) gig; and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) way home,
just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was leaving the village of Lavington, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) overtook Sam
Brattle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) stopped and spoke to the lad, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was
returning home, and offering him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) a seat in the gig. Sam declined the
seat, but said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was going straight to the mill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very hard to make crooked things straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick
to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) drove up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own hall-door.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVI.

<p/>THE TURNOVER CORRESPONDENCE.


<p/>It is hoped that the reader will remember that the Marquis of
Trowbridge was subjected to very great insolence from Mr. Fenwick
during the discussion which took place in poor old farmer Trumbull's
parlour respecting the murder. Our friend, the Vicar, did not content
himself with personal invective, but made allusion to the Marquis's
daughters. The Marquis, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was driven home in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) carriage, came
to sundry conclusions about Mr. Fenwick. That the man was an infidel
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had now no matter of doubt whatever; and if an infidel, then also
a hypocrite, and a liar, and a traitor, and a thief. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) not
robbing the parish of the tithes, and all the while entrapping the
souls of men and women? Was it not to be expected that with such a
pastor there should be such as Sam Brattle and Carry Brattle in the
parish? It was true that as yet this full blown iniquity had spread
itself only among the comparatively small number of tenants belonging
to the objectionable <div class="bookquote">``person,''  (<font color='red'><b>tenants</b></font>)</div>who unfortunately owned a small number
of acres in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) lordship's parish;--but his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) lordship's tenant had
been murdered! And with such a pastor in the parish, and such an
objectionable person, owning acres, to back the pastor, might it not
be expected that all his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) tenants would be murdered? Many applications
had already been made to the Marquis for the Church Farm; but as it
happened that the applicant whom the Marquis intended to favour, had
declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did not wish to live in the house because of the
murder, the Marquis felt himself justified in concluding that if
everything about the parish were not changed very shortly, no decent
person would be found willing to live in any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) houses. And now,
when they had been talking of murderers, and worse than murderers,
as the Marquis said to himself, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) head with horror in the
carriage as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) thought of such iniquity, this infidel clergyman had
dared to allude to his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) lordship's daughters! Such a man had no right
even to think of women so exalted. The existence of the Ladies Stowte
must no doubt be known to such men, and among themselves probably
some allusion in the way of faint guesses might be made as to their
modes of life, as men guess at kings and queens, and even at gods and
goddesses. But to have an illustration, and a very base illustration,
drawn from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own daughters in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own presence, made with the
object of confuting himself,--this was more than the Marquis could
endure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could not horsewhip Mr. Fenwick; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) send out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) retainers to do so; but, thank God, there was a bishop! He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did
not quite see his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) way, but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) thought that Mr. Fenwick might be made
at least to leave that parish. <div class="bookquote">``Turn my daughters out of my house,
because--oh, oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) almost put his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) fist through the carriage window
in the energy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) action as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought of it.

<p/>As it happened, the Marquis of Trowbridge had never sat in the House
of Commons, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had a son who sat there now. Lord St. George was
member for another county in which Lord Trowbridge had an estate,
and was a man of the world. His (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) father admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) much, and trusted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) a good deal, but still had an idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) son hardly estimated
in the proper light the position in the world which he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) was called
to fill. Lord St. George was now at home at the Castle, and in the
course of that evening the father, as a matter of course, consulted
the son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) considered that it would be his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) duty to write to the
bishop, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would like to hear St. George's idea on the subject.
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) began, of course, by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not doubt but that St.
George would agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't make any fuss about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! pass it over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you understand the kind of allusion that was made to your
sisters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't hurt them, my lord; and people make allusion to everything
now-a-days. The bishop can't do anything. For aught you know he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) and
Fenwick may be bosom friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The bishop, St. George, is a most right-thinking man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt. The bishops, I believe, are all right-thinking men, and it
is well for them that they are so very seldom called on to go beyond
thinking. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll think that this fellow was indiscreet; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can't go beyond thinking. You'll only be raising a blister for
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Raising a what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A blister, my lord. The longer I live the more convinced I become
that a man shouldn't keep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own sores open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something in the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) son's conversation which
pained the Marquis much; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son was known to be a wise and
prudent man, and one who was rising in the political world. The
Marquis sighed, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) head, and murmured something as to the
duty which lay upon the great to bear the troubles incident to their
greatness;--by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) meant that sores and blisters should be
kept open, if the exigencies of rank so required. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) ended the
discussion at last by declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would rest upon the matter
for forty-eight hours. Unfortunately before those forty-eight hours
were over Lord St. George had gone from Turnover Castle, and the
Marquis was left to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own lights. In the meantime, the father and
son and one or two friends, had been shooting over at Bullhampton;
so that no further steps of warfare had been taken when Mr. and Mrs.
Fenwick met the Marquis on the pathway.

<p/>On the following day his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) lordship sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) own private room
thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) grievance. He (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) had thought of it and of little else
for now nearly sixty hours. <div class="bookquote">``Suggest to me to turn out my daughters!
Heaven and earth! My daughters!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) was well aware that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) son often differed, he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) could never so safely keep himself out
of trouble as by following his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) son's advice. But surely this was a
matter per se, standing altogether on its own bottom, very different
from those ordinary details of life on which he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) son were wont
to disagree. His (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) daughters! The Ladies Sophie and Carolina Stowte! It
had been suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) to turn them out of his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) house because-- Oh!
oh! The insult was so great that no human marquis could stand it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) longed to be writing a letter to the bishop. He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) was proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>)
letters. Pen and paper were at hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) did write.


<p/>RIGHT REV. AND DEAR LORD BISHOP,

<p/>I think it right to represent to your lordship the
conduct,--I believe I may be justified in saying the
misconduct,--of the Reverend -- Fenwick, the vicar of
Bullhampton.


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew our friend's Christian name very well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not choose
to have it appear that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) august memory had been laden with a thing
so trifling.


<p/>You may have heard that there has been a most horrid
murder committed in the parish on one of my tenants; and
that suspicion is rife that the murder was committed in
part by a young man, the son of a miller who lives under
a person who owns some land in the parish. The family is
very bad, one of the daughters being, as I understand,
a prostitute. The other day I thought it right to visit
the parish with the view of preventing, if possible, the
sojourn there among my people of these objectionable
characters. When there I was encountered by Mr. Fenwick,
not only in a most unchristian spirit, but in a bearing so
little gentlemanlike, that I cannot describe it to you.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had obtruded himself into my presence, into one of my
own houses, the very house of the murdered man, and there,
when I was consulting with the person to whom I have
alluded as to the expediency of ridding ourselves of these
objectionable characters, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met me with ribaldry and
personal insolence. When I tell your lordship that he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>)
made insinuations about my own daughters, so gross that
I cannot repeat them to you, I am sure that I need go no
further. There were present at this meeting Mr. Puddleham,
the Methodist minister, and Mr. Henry Gilmore, the
landlord of the persons in question.

<p/>Your lordship has probably heard the character, in a
religious point of view, of this gentleman. It is not for
me to express an opinion of the motives which can induce
such a one to retain his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) position as an incumbent of a
parish. But I do believe that I have a right to ask from
your lordship for some inquiry into the scene which I have
attempted to describe, and to expect some protection for
the future. I do not for a moment doubt that your lordship
will do what is right in the matter.

<p/>I have the honour to be,
Right Reverend and dear Lord Bishop,
Your most obedient and faithful Servant,

<p/>TROWBRIDGE.


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>TROWBRIDGE</b></font>) read this over thrice, and became so much in love with the
composition, that on the third reading he (<font color='blue'><b>TROWBRIDGE</b></font>) had not the slightest doubt
as to the expediency of sending it. Nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>TROWBRIDGE</b></font>) much doubt but that
the bishop would do something to Mr. Fenwick, which would make the
parish too hot to hold that disgrace to the Church of England.

<p/>When Fenwick came home from Pycroft Common he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) found a letter from the
bishop awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had driven forty miles on that day, and was
rather late for dinner. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife, however, came upstairs with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) in
order that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might hear something of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) story, and brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
letters with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not open that from the bishop till he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was
half dressed, and then burst out into loud laughter as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) read it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Frank?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife, through the open door of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own
room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's such a game,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Never mind; let's have dinner, and
then you shall see it.''  (<font color='red'><b>The reader</b></font>)</div>The reader, however, may be quite sure that
Mrs. Fenwick did not wait till dinner was served before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew the
nature of the game.

<p/>The bishop's letter to the Vicar was very short and very rational,
and it was not that which made the Vicar laugh; but inside the
bishop's letter was that from the Marquis. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. Fenwick,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop,


<p/>after a good deal of consideration, I have determined to
send you the enclosed. I do so because I have made it a
rule never to receive an accusation against one of my
clergy without sending it to the person accused. You will,
of course, perceive that it alludes to some matter which
lies outside of my control and right of inquiry; but
perhaps you will allow me, as a friend, to suggest to you
that it is always well for a parish clergyman to avoid
controversy and quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) neighbours; and that it
is especially expedient that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) should be on good terms
with those who have influence in his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) parish. Perhaps
you will forgive me if I add that a spirit of pugnacity,
though no doubt it may lead to much that is good, has its
bad tendencies if not watched closely.

<p/>Pray remember that Lord Trowbridge is a worthy man, doing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) duty on the whole well; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) position, though
it be entitled to no veneration, is entitled to much
respect. If you can tell me that you will feel no grudge
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) for what has taken place, I shall be very
happy.

<p/>You will observe that I have been careful that this letter
shall have no official character.

<p/>Yours very faithfully,

<p/>&c., &c., &c.


<p/>The letter was answered that evening, but before the answer was
written, the Marquis of Trowbridge was discussed between the husband
and wife, not in complimentary terms. Mrs. Fenwick on the occasion
was more pugnacious than her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could not forgive the man
who had hinted to the bishop that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband held his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) living from
unworthy motives, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a bad clergyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Fenwick, <div class="bookquote">``what can you expect from an ass but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) ears?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't expect downright slander from such a man as the Marquis of
Trowbridge, and if I were you I should tell the bishop so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) nothing of the kind. I shall write about the
Marquis with the kindliest feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't feel kindly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. The poor old idiot has nobody to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) right, and does
the best he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) can according to his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) lights. I have no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) thinks
that I am everything that is horrid. I am not a bit angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>),
and would be as civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) to-morrow as my nature would allow me,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) would only be civil to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) letter which will complete the correspondence, and
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) dated for the following day:--


<p/>Bullhampton Vicarage, Oct. 23, 186--.

<p/>MY DEAR LORD BISHOP,

<p/>I return the Marquis's letter with many thanks. I can
assure you that I take in proper spirit your little hints
as to my pugnacity of disposition, and will endeavour
to profit by them. My wife tells me that I am given to
combativeness, and I have no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is right.

<p/>As to Lord Trowbridge, I can assure your lordship that I
will not bear any malice against him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>), or even think ill of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) complaint. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) and I probably differ in
opinion about almost everything, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) is one of those
who pity the condition of all who are so blinded as to
differ from him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>). The next time that I am thrown into his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
company I shall act exactly as though no such letter had
been written, and as if no such meeting had taken place as
that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) describes.

<p/>I hope I may be allowed to assure your lordship, without
any reference to my motives for keeping it, that I shall
be very slow to give up a living in your lordship's
diocese. As your letter to me is unofficial,--and I thank
you heartily for sending it in such form,--I have ventured
to reply in the same strain.

<p/>I am, my dear Lord Bishop,
Your very faithful servant,

<p/>FRANCIS FENWICK.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) folded it, and handed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``I
shall never see the remainder of the series. I would give a shilling
to know how the bishop gets out of it in writing to the Marquis,
and half-a-crown to see the Marquis's rejoinder.''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>The reader shall
be troubled with neither, as he (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) would hardly price them so high as
did the Vicar. The bishop's letter really contained little beyond
an assurance on his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) part that Mr. Fenwick had not meant anything
wrong, and that the matter was one with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), the bishop, had no
concern; all which was worded with most complete episcopal courtesy.
The rejoinder of the Marquis was long, elaborate, and very pompous.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did not exactly scold the bishop, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) expressed very plainly
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) opinion that the Church of England was going to the dogs, because
a bishop had not the power of utterly abolishing any clergyman who
might be guilty of an offence against so distinguished a person as
the Marquis of Trowbridge.

<p/>But what was to be done about Carry Brattle? Mrs. Fenwick, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) anger against the Marquis, was quite ready
to own that the matter of Carry's position was to them of much
greater moment than the wrath of the peer. How were they to put
out their hands and save that brand from the burning? Fenwick, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) ill-considered zeal, suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might be brought to
the Vicarage; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife at once knew that such a step would be
dangerous in every way. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) live, and what would she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) do?
And what would the other servants think of it?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why would the other servants mind it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>asked Fenwick. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife
on such a matter could have a way of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own, and that project was
soon knocked on the head. No doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's house was the proper
place for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but then her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father was so dour a man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) is the only person in the world
of whom I believe myself to be afraid. When I get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) I do not
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) as I would to another; and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) knows it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless, if anything was to be done for Carry Brattle, it seemed
as though it must be done by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's permission and assistance.
<div class="bookquote">``There can be no doubt that it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) duty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not say that as a certainty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the husband. <div class="bookquote">``There is a
point at which, I presume, a father may be justified in disowning a
child. The possession of such a power, no doubt, keeps others from
going wrong. What one wants is that a father should be presumed
to have the power; but that when the time comes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should never
use it. It is the comfortable doctrine which we are all of us
teaching;--wrath, and abomination of the sinner, before the sin;
pardon and love after it. If you were to run away from me, Janet--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Frank, do not dare to speak of anything so horrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say now probably that were you to do so, I would never
blast my eyes by looking at you again; but I know that I should run
after you, and implore you to come back to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't do anything of the kind; and it isn't proper to talk
about it; and I shall go to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very difficult to make crooked things straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the
Vicar, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) walked about the room after his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ought to go into a reformatory. But I know she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wouldn't;
and I shouldn't like to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) after what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>It is probably the case that Mr. Fenwick would have been able to do
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) duty better, had some harsher feeling towards the sinner been
mixed with his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) charity.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I NEVER SHAMED NONE OF THEM.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something must be done about Carry Brattle at once.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div>The Vicar felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had pledged himself to take some steps for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) welfare, and
it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) thought of the matter, that there were only
two steps possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) might intercede with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) might
use his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) influence to have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) received into some house of correction,
some retreat, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might be kept from evil and disciplined
for good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) knew that the latter would be the safer plan, if it
could be brought to bear; and it would certainly be the easier for
himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had almost pledged himself to the
girl not to attempt it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) felt sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not accede
to it. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend Gilmore, intending to
obtain the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend's wisdom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) found the Squire and the
Prebendary together, and at once started his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll do no good, Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chamberlaine, after the
two younger men had been discussing the matter for half an hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that I ought not to try to do any good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that such efforts never come to anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the unfortunate creatures in the world, then, should be left to
go to destruction in their own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is useless, I think, to treat special cases in an exceptional
manner. When such is done, it is done from enthusiasm, and enthusiasm
is never useful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What ought a man to do, then, for the assistance of such
fellow-creatures as this poor girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>asked the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are penitentiaries and reformatories, and it is well, no
doubt, to subscribe to them,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Prebendary. <div class="bookquote">``The subject is so
full of difficulty that one should not touch it rashly. Henry, where
is the last Quarterly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never take it, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to have remembered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chamberlaine, smiling blandly.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) took up the Saturday Review, and endeavoured to content
himself with that.

<p/>Gilmore and Fenwick walked down to the mill together, it being
understood that the Squire was not to show himself there. Fenwick's
difficult task, if it were to be done at all, must be done by himself
alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) must beard the lion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) den, and make the attack without
any assistant. Gilmore had upon the whole been disposed to think
that no such attack should be made. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'ll only turn upon you with
violence, and no good will be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) can't eat me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Fenwick had replied, acknowledging, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) approached the
undertaking with fear and trembling. Before they were far from the
house Gilmore had changed the conversation and fallen back upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
own sorrows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had not answered Mary's letter, and now declared
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) did not intend to do so. What could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
could not write and profess friendship; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could not offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) congratulations; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could not belie his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) heart by affecting
indifference. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) over, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) knew it. Of what
use would it be to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
miserable for ever? <div class="bookquote">``I shall break up the house and get away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't do that rashly, Harry. There can be no spot in the world in
which you can be so useful as you are here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All my usefulness has been dragged out of me. I don't care about the
place or about the people. I am ill already, and shall become worse.
I think I will go abroad for four or five years. I've an idea I shall
go to the States.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll become tired of that, I should think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall. Everything is tiresome to me. I don't think
anything else can be so tiresome as my uncle, and yet I dread his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
leaving me,--when I shall be alone. I suppose if one was out among
the Rocky Mountains, one wouldn't think so much about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Atra Cura sits behind the horseman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know
that travelling will do it. One thing certainly will do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hard work. Some doctor told his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) patient that if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'d live on
half-a-crown a day and earn it, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'d soon be well. I'm sure that the
same prescription holds good for all maladies of the mind. You can't
earn the half-crown a day, but you may work as hard as though you
did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Read, dig, shoot, look after the farm, and say your prayers. Don't
allow yourself time for thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a fine philosophy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't think any man
ever made himself happy by it. I'll leave you now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd go and dig, if I were you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I will. Do you know, I've half an idea that I'll go to
Loring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What good will that do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll find out whether this man is a blackguard. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is. My
uncle knows something about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, and says that a bigger scamp
never lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see what good you can do, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. And so
they parted.

<p/>Fenwick was about half a mile from the mill when Gilmore left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wished that it were a mile and a half. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) knew well that an
edict had gone forth at the mill that no one should speak to the old
man about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter. With the mother the Vicar had often spoken
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lost child, and had learned from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) how sad it was to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could never dare to mention Carry's name to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) child, and had sworn that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should never more have
part in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had brought sorrow and shame upon him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had cut her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) off with a steady resolve that there should be no
weak backsliding on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) part. Those who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) best declared that
the miller would certainly keep his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) word, and hitherto no one had
dared to speak of the lost one in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father's hearing. All this Mr.
Fenwick knew, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew also that the man was one who could be very
fierce in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife that old Brattle was the
only man in the world before whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) would be afraid to speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
mind openly, and in so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had expressed a feeling that was
very general throughout all Bullhampton. Mr. Puddleham was a very
meddlesome man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) had once ventured out to the mill to say a
word, not indeed about Carry, but touching some youthful iniquity of
which Sam was supposed to have been guilty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) never went near the
mill again, but would shudder and lift up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) hands and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) eyes when
the miller's name was mentioned. It was not that Brattle used rough
language, or became violently angry when accosted; but there was a
sullen sternness about the man, and a capability of asserting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
mastery and personal authority, which reduced those who attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
to the condition of vanquished combatants, and repulsed them, so that
they would retreat as beaten dogs. Mr. Fenwick, indeed, had always
been well received at the mill. The women of the family loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
dearly, and took great comfort in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) visits. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) first arrival
in the parish he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had been on intimate terms with them, though the old
man had never once entered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) church. Brattle himself would bear
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more kindly than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own landlord, who might
at any day have turned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) holding. But even Fenwick had
been so answered more than once as to have been forced to retreat
with that feeling of having his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) tail, like a cur, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) legs.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can't eat me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said to himself, as the low willows round the
mill came in sight. When a man is reduced to that consolation, as
many a man often is, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be nearly sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be eaten.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got over the stile into the lane close to the mill-door,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found that the mill was going. Gilmore had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) that it
might probably be so, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had heard that the repairs were nearly
finished. Fenwick was sure that after so long a period of enforced
idleness Brattle would be in the mill, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) went at first into
the house and there found Mrs. Brattle and Fanny. Even with them he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
hardly felt himself to be at home, but after a while managed to ask a
few questions about Sam. Sam had come back, and was now at work, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had had some terribly hard words with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father. The old man had
desired to know where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son had been. Sam had declined to tell, and
had declared that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was to be cross-questioned about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) comings
and goings he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would leave the mill altogether. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had better go. Sam had not gone, but the two had been
working on together since without interchanging a word. <div class="bookquote">``I want to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) especially,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean Sam, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>asked the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father. I will go out into the lane, and perhaps Fanny will
ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) to come to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Brattle immediately became dismayed by a
troop of fears, and looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) face with soft, supplicating,
tearful eyes. So much of sorrow had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) of late! <div class="bookquote">``There is
nothing wrong, Mrs. Brattle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought perhaps you had heard something of Sam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but what has made me surer than ever that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had no part in
what was done at Mr. Trumbull's farm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God for that!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) by the hand. Then
Fanny went into the mill, and the Vicar followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) out of the
house, on to the lane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) stood leaning against a tree till the old
man came to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then shook the miller's hand, and made some
remark about the mill. They had begun again that morning, the miller
said. Sam had been off again, or they might have been at work on
yesterday forenoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has been on a good work,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the
Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good or bad, I know nowt of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, and if you wish I will tell you; but there is another
thing I must say first. Come a little way down the lane with me, Mr.
Brattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>The Vicar had assumed a tone which was almost one of rebuke,--not
intending it, but falling into it from want of histrionic power in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) attempt to be bold and solemn at the same time. The miller at
once resented it. <div class="bookquote">``Why should I come down the lane?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You're
axing me to come out at a very busy moment, Muster Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing can be so important as that which I have to say. For the
love of God, Mr. Brattle,--for the love you bear your wife and
children, endure with me for ten minutes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) paused, and walked
on, and Mr. Brattle was still at his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) elbow. <div class="bookquote">``My friend, I have seen
your daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which daughter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, arresting his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your daughter Carry, Mr. Brattle.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Then the old man turned round and
would have hurried back to the mill without a word; but the Vicar
held him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) coat. <div class="bookquote">``If I have ever been a friend to you or yours
listen to me now one minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I come to your house and tell you of your sorrows and your shame?
Let me go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brattle, if you will stretch forth your hand, you may save her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is your own child--your flesh and blood. Think how easy it is for
a poor girl to fall,--how great is the temptation and how quick, and
how it comes without knowledge of the evil that is to follow! How
small is the sin, and how terrible the punishment! Your friends, Mr.
Brattle, have forgiven you worse sins than ever she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has committed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never shamed none of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), struggling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) way back to
the mill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is that, then;--your own misfortune and not the girl's sin that
would harden your heart against your own child? You will let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
perish in the streets, not because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has fallen, but because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
has hurt you in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fall! Is that to be a father? Is that to be a
man? Mr. Brattle, think better of yourself, and dare to obey the
instincts of your heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>But by this time the miller had escaped, and was striding off in
furious silence to the mill. The Vicar, oppressed by a sense of utter
failure, feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) interference had been absolutely valueless,
that the man's wrath and constancy were things altogether beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
reach, stood where he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been left, hardly daring to return to the
mill and say a word or two to the women there. But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) did
go back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) knew well that Brattle himself would not be seen in the
house till his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) present mood was over. After any encounter of words
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would go and work in silence for half a day, and would seldom or
never refer again to what had taken place; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would never, so thought
the Vicar, refer to the encounter which had just taken place; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
would remember it always, and it might be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would never again
speak in friendship to a man who had offended him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so deeply.

<p/>After a moment's thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) determined to tell the wife, and informed
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and Fanny that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen Carry over at Pycroft Common. The
mother's questions as to what her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child was doing, how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
living, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were ill or well, and, alas! whether she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were
happy or miserable, who cannot imagine?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is anything but happy, I fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor Carry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should be happy till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) be brought back
to the decencies of life. What shall we do to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) come if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were let to come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>asked Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would. I feel sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) say, Mr. Fenwick?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>asked the mother. The Vicar only
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)'s very good; to me he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)'s ever been good as gold.
But, oh, Mr. Fenwick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) is so hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) will not let you speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never a word, Mr. Fenwick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'d look at you, sir, so that the gleam
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) eyes would fall on you like a blow. I wouldn't dare;--nor yet
wouldn't Fanny, who dares more with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) than any of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it'd serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), I'd speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But couldn't I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), Mr. Fenwick? Couldn't you take me in the
gig with you, sir? I'd slip out arter breakfast up the road, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
wouldn't be no wiser, at least till I war back again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wouldn't ax
no questions then, I'm thinking. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), Fan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'d ask at dinner; but if I said you were out for the day along
with Mr. Fenwick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wouldn't say any more, maybe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'d know well
enough where you was gone to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Fenwick said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would think of it, and let Fanny know on
the following Sunday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would not make a promise now, and at any
rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could not go before Sunday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not like to pledge himself
suddenly to such an adventure, knowing that it would be best that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
should first have his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife's ideas on the matter. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
leave, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) went out of the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) saw the miller standing at
the door of the mill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) hand and said, <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but
the miller quickly turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) and retreated into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
mill.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) walked up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) house through the village he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) met Mr.
Puddleham. <div class="bookquote">``So Sam Brattle is off again, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>said the minister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Off what, Mr. Puddleham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone clean away. Out of the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has told you that, Mr. Puddleham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it true, sir? You ought to know, Mr. Fenwick, as you're one of
the bailsmen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just been at the mill, and I didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you'll ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) at the mill again, Mr. Fenwick;
nor yet in Bullhampton, unless the police have to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I was saying, I didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) at the mill, Mr. Puddleham,
because I didn't go in; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)'s working there at this moment, and
has been all the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)'s all right, Mr. Puddleham. You go and have
a few words with him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>), or with his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) father, and you'll find they're
quite comfortable at the mill now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Constable Hicks told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) was out of the country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Puddleham, walking away in considerable disgust.

<p/>Mrs. Fenwick's opinion was, upon the whole, rather in favour of the
second expedition to Pycroft Common, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) declared that the mother
should at any rate be allowed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) indeed would not
submit to the idea of the miller's indomitable powers. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) were
Mrs. Brattle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)'d pull the old man's ears, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
give way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You go and try,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/>On the Sunday morning following, Fanny was told that on Wednesday
Mr. Fenwick would drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother over to Pycroft Common. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had no
doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said, but that Carry would still be found living with Mrs.
Burrows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) explained that the old woman had luckily been absent
during his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) visit, but would probably be there when they went again.
As to that they must take their chance. And the whole plan was
arranged. Mr. Fenwick was to be on the road in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) gig at Mr.
Gilmore's gate at ten o'clock, and Mrs. Brattle was to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) there
at that hour.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII.

<p/>MRS. BRATTLE``S JOURNEY.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration-RSB-

<p/>Mrs. Brattle was waiting at the stile opposite to Mr. Gilmore's gate
as Mr. Fenwick drove up to the spot. No doubt the dear old woman
had been there for the last half-hour, thinking that the walk would
take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) twice as long as it did, and fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might keep
the Vicar waiting. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had put on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Sunday clothes and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Sunday
bonnet, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) climbed up into the vacant place beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
friend she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position to be so strange that for a while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
could hardly speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said a few words to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with
no questions, understanding the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) embarrassment. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could
not but think that of all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) parishioners no two were so unlike
each other as were the miller and his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) wife. The one was so hard and
invincible;--the other so soft and submissive! Nevertheless it had
always been said that Brattle had been a tender and affectionate
husband. By degrees the woman's awe at the horse and gig and
strangeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position wore off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had brought a little bundle with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
might supply feminine wants, and had apologised humbly for venturing
to come so laden. Fenwick, who remembered what Carry had said about
money that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still had, and who was nearly sure that the murderers
had gone to Pycroft Common after the murder had been committed, had
found a difficulty in explaining to Mrs. Brattle that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) child was
probably not in want. The son had been accused of the murder of the
man, and now the Vicar had but little doubt that the daughter was
living on the proceeds of the robbery. <div class="bookquote">``It's a hard life she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) must be
living, Mr. Fenwick, with an old `ooman the likes of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Brattle. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps if I'd brought a morsel of some'at to eat--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think they're pressed in that way, Mrs. Brattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't they now? But it's a`most worse, Mr. Fenwick, when one thinks
where it's to come from. The Lord have mercy on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
out of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bright at all, and simple still? She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was the brightest,
simplest lass in all Bull`ompton, I used to think. I suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) old
ways have a`most left her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), Mr. Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) very like what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) used to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Deed now, did you, Mr. Fenwick? And she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) wasn't mopish and
slatternly like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was tidy enough. You wouldn't wish me to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was
happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not, Mr. Fenwick. I shouldn't ought;--ought I, now? But,
Mr. Fenwick, I'd give my left hand she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should be happy and gay once
more. I suppose none but a mother feels it, but the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
voice through the house was ever the sweetest music I know'd on.
It'll never have the same ring again, Mr. Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) that it would. That sainted sinner of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>)
had reminded Mr. Puddleham, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had attained to the joy of the
Lord,--even she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had never regained the mirth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) young innocence.
There is a bloom on the flower which may rest there till the
flower has utterly perished, if the handling of it be sufficiently
delicate;--but no care, nothing that can be done by friends on earth,
or even by better friendship from above, can replace that when once
displaced. The sound of which the mother was thinking could never be
heard again from Carry Brattle's voice. <div class="bookquote">``If we could only get her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
home once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might be a good daughter to you
still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd be a good mother to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Mr. Fenwick;--but I'm thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'ll
never have it so. I never knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to change on a thing like that,
Mr. Fenwick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) felt it that keenly, it nigh killed `im. Only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
took it out o' hisself in thrashing that wicked man, I a`most think
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'d a' died o' it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>Again the Vicar drove to the Bald-faced Stag, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) walked
along the road and over the common. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) arm to the old
woman, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wouldn't accept it; nor would she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) upon any entreaty
allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bundle. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) doing so
would make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) utterly wretched, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) gave up the point.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suffered nothing from fatigue, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) two
miles' walk would not be more than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Sunday journey to church and
back. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew near to the house she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) became uneasy, and once
asked to be allowed to pause for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``May be, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``after all, my girl'd rather that I wouldn't trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) took
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by the arm and led her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) along, and comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
that if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms Carry would for the
moment be in a heaven of happiness. <div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into my arms, Mr.
Fenwick? Why,--isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in my very heart of hearts at this moment?
And I won't say not a word sharp to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>);--not now, Mr. Fenwick. And
why would I say sharp words at all? I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) understands it
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does, Mrs. Brattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>They had now reached the door, and the Vicar knocked. No answer came
at once; but such had been the case when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) knocked before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had
learned to understand that in such a household it might not be wise
to admit all comers without consideration. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) knocked again,--and
then again. But still there came no answer. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) tried the door,
and found that it was locked. <div class="bookquote">``May be she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)'s seen me coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the
mother, <div class="bookquote">``and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) won't let me in.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>The Vicar then went round the
cottage, and found that the back door also was closed. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) looked
in at one of the front windows, and became aware that no one was
sitting, at least in the kitchen. There was an upstairs room, but of
that the window was closed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that neither of them is at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) heard the voice of a woman calling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) from the
door of the nearest cottage,--one of the two brick tenements which
stood together,--and from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) learned that Mrs. Burrows had gone
into Devizes, and would not probably be home till the evening. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) asked after Carry, not mentioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) name, but speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) as
the young woman who lived with Mrs. Burrows. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) young man come and
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) up to Lon`on o' Saturday,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman.

<p/>Fenwick heard the words, but Mrs. Brattle did not hear them. It did
not occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) not to believe the woman's statement, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
hopes about the poor creature were at once dashed to the ground. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
first feeling was no doubt one of resentment, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had broken
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not go within a month
without letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) know that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going; and there is no fault,
no vice, that strikes any of us so strongly as falsehood or injustice
against ourselves. And then the nature of the statement was so
terrible! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had gone back into utter degradation and iniquity. And
who was the young man? As far as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could obtain a clue, through the
information which had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from various sources, this young
man must be the companion of the Grinder in the murder and robbery of
Mr. Trumbull. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) has gone away, Mrs. Brattle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>), with as sad
a voice as ever a man used.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And where be she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) gone to, Mr. Fenwick? Cannot I go arter her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
simply shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by the arm to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) away. <div class="bookquote">``Do
they know nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), Mr. Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) has gone away; probably to London. We must think no more about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), Mrs. Brattle--at any rate for the present. I can only say that I
am very, very sorry that I brought you here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bullhampton/BULLHAMPTON</b></font>)</div><p/>The drive back to Bullhampton was very silent and very sad. Mrs.
Brattle had before her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) the difficulty of explaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) journey to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) husband, together with the feeling that the difficulty had been
incurred altogether for nothing. As for Fenwick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was angry with
himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own past enthusiasm about the girl. After all, Mr.
Chamberlaine had shown himself to be the wiser man of the two. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had declared it to be no good to take up special cases, and the
Vicar as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) drove himself home notified to himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) assent with
the Prebendary's doctrine. The girl had gone off the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had ascertained that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends were aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) presence and
situation. What to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been the kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clerical friend,
or the stories brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) early home, or the dirt and
squalor of the life which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was leading? The moment that there was
a question of bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back to the decencies of the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
escaped from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends and hurried back to the pollution which, no
doubt, had charms for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had allowed himself to think that in
spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) impurity, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might again be almost pure, and this was
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reward! He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) deposited the poor woman at the spot at which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
taken her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up, almost without a word, and then drove himself home with
a heavy heart. <div class="bookquote">``I believe it will be best to be like her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father, and
never to name her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what has she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) done, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone back to the life which I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) likes best. Let us say no
more about it,--at any rate for the present. I'm sick at heart when I
think of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Brattle, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) got over the stile close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) own home, saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) husband standing at the mill door. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) heart sank within her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), if
that could be said to sink which was already so low. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not move,
but stood there with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
might get into the house unobserved by him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and learn from Fanny what
had taken place; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt so like a culprit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hardly dared
to enter the door. Would it not be best to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) at once, and ask
his (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) pardon for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had done? When he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) did
at last, his (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) voice was a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Where hast been, Maggie?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>)
asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>), put her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand on the lappet of his (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) coat and
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Best go in and sit easy, and hear what God sends,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What's the use of scouring about the country here and
there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There has been no use in it to-day, feyther,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There arn't no use in it,--not never,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) said; and after that there
was no more about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went into the house and handed the bundle
to Fanny, and sat down on the bed and cried. On the following morning
Frank Fenwick received the following letter:--


<p/>London, Sunday.

<p/>HONOURED SIR,

<p/>I told you that I would write if it came as I was going
away, but I've been forced to go without writing. There
was nothing to write with at the cottage. Mrs. Burrows
and me had words, and I thought as she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) would rob me, and
perhaps worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) is a bad woman, and I could stand it no
longer, so I just come up here, as there was nowhere else
for me to find a place to lie down in. I thought I'd just
write and tell you, because of my word; but I know it
isn't no use.

<p/>I'd send my respects and love to father and mother, if I
dared. I did think of going over; but I know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d kill me,
and so he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ought. I'd send my respects to Mrs. Fenwick,
only that I isn't fit to name her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>);--and my love to sister
Fanny. I've come away here, and must just wait till I die.

<p/>Yours humbly, and most unfortunate,

<p/>CARRY.

<p/>If it's any good to be sorry, nobody can be more sorry
than me, and nobody more unhappy. I did try to pray when
you was gone, but it only made me more ashamed. If there
was only anywhere to go to, I'd go.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIX.

<p/>THE BULL AT LORING.


<p/>Gilmore had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would do two things,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
would start off and travel for four or five years, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would
pay a visit to Loring. Fenwick had advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to do neither, but to
stay at home and dig and say his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) prayers. But in such emergencies
no man takes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend's advice; and when Mr. Chamberlaine had
left him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>), Gilmore had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would at any rate go
to Loring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) went to church on the Sunday morning, and was half
resolved to tell Mrs. Fenwick of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) purpose; but chance delayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
in the church, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) sauntered away home without having mentioned
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) let half the next week pass by without stirring beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
own ground. During those three days he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) mind half a dozen
times; but at last, on the Thursday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) portmanteau packed
and started on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) journey. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was preparing to leave the house
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wrote one line to Fenwick in pencil. <div class="bookquote">``I am this moment off to
Loring.--H. G.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) left in the village as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) drove through to
the Westbury station.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had formed no idea in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own mind of any definite purpose in
going. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) should do or what say when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) got to
Loring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) had told himself a hundred times that any persecution of
the girl on his (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) part would be mean and unworthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) was
also aware that no condition in which a man could place himself was
more open to contempt than that of a whining, pining, unsuccessful
lover. A man is bound to take a woman's decision against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), bear
it as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may, and say as little against it as possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is bound
to do so when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is convinced that a woman's decision is final; and
there can be no stronger proof of such finality than the fact that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has declared a preference for some other man. All this Gilmore
knew, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would not divest himself of the idea that there might
still be some turn in the wheel of fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had heard a vague
rumour that Captain Marrable, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) rival, was a very dangerous man.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle was quite sure that the Captain's father was thoroughly
bad, and had thrown out hints against the son, which Gilmore in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
anxiety magnified till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) felt convinced that the girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) loved
with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) heart was going to throw herself into the arms of a
thorough scamp. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) not do something, if not for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own sake,
then for hers? Might it not be possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) to deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) danger? What, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) should discover some great iniquity;--would
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not then in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gratitude be softened towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)? It was on
the cards that this reprobate was married already, and was about
to commit bigamy. It was quite probable that such a man should be
deeply in debt. As for the fortune that had been left to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mr.
Chamberlaine had already ascertained that that amounted to nothing.
It had been consumed to the last shilling in paying the joint debts
of the father and son. Men such as Mr. Chamberlaine have sources of
information which are marvellous to the minds of those who are more
secluded, and not the less marvellous because the information is
invariably false. Gilmore in this way almost came to a conviction
that Mary Lowther was about to sacrifice herself to a man utterly
unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taught himself, not to think,--but to believe
it to be possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might save her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>). Those who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the last man in the world to be carried away
by a romantic notion;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own idea of romance as plainly
developed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind as was ever the case with a knight of old, who
went forth for the relief of a distressed damsel. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do
anything towards saving her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do it, or try to do it, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be brought to ruin in the attempt. Might it not be that at
last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have the reward which other knights always attained?
The chance in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favour was doubtless small, but the world was
nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without this chance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been at Loring before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had learned the way. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
went to Chippenham and Swindon, and then by the train to Loring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>)
had no very definite plan formed for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) rather thought that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) would call at Miss Marrable's house,--call if possible when Mary
Lowther was not there,--and learn from the elder lady something of
the facts of the case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) had been well aware for many weeks past,
from early days in the summer, that old Miss Marrable had been in
favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) claim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) had heard too that there had been family
quarrels among the Marrables, and a word had been dropped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>)
hearing by Mrs. Fenwick, which had implied that Miss Marrable was
by no means pleased with the match which her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) niece Mary Lowther was
proposing to herself. Everything seemed to show that Captain Marrable
was a most undesirable person.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) reached the station at Loring it was incumbent on him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) to go
somewhither at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) must provide for himself for the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
found two omnibuses at the station, and two inn servants competing
with great ardour for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) carpet bag. There were the Dragon and the
Bull fighting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). The Bull in the Lowtown was commercial and
prosperous. The Dragon at Uphill was aristocratic, devoted to county
purposes, and rather hard set to keep its jaws open and its tail
flying. Prosperity is always becoming more prosperous, and the
allurements of the Bull prevailed. <div class="bookquote">``Are you a going to rob the gent
of his (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) walise?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Bull</b></font>)</div>said the indignant Boots of the Bull as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) rescued
Mr. Gilmore's property from the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) natural enemy, as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had secured the entrance of Mr. Gilmore into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own vehicle.
Had Mr. Gilmore known that the Dragon was next door but one to Miss
Marrable's house, and that the Bull was nearly equally contiguous
to that in which Captain Marrable was residing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) choice probably
would not have been altered. In such cases, the knight who is to be
the deliverer desires above all things that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) may be near to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)
enemy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was shown up to a bedroom, and then ushered into the commercial
room of the house. Loring, though it does a very pretty trade as a
small town, and now has for some years been regarded as a thriving
place in its degree, is not of such importance in the way of business
as to support a commercial inn of the first class. At such houses the
commercial room is as much closed against the uninitiated as is a
first-class club in London. In such rooms a non-commercial man would
be almost as much astray as is a non-broker in Capel Court, or an
attorney in a bar mess-room. At the Bull things were a little mixed.
The very fact that the words <div class="bookquote">``Commercial Room''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were painted on the
door proved to those who understood such matters that there was a
doubt in the case. They had no coffee room at the Bull, and strangers
who came that way were of necessity shown into that in which the
gentlemen of the road were wont to relax themselves. Certain
commercial laws are maintained in such apartments. Cigars are not
allowed before nine o'clock, except upon some distinct arrangement
with the waiter. There is not, as a rule, a regular daily commercial
repast; but when three or more gentlemen dine together at five
o'clock, the dinner becomes a commercial dinner, and the commercial
laws as to wine, &c., are enforced, with more or less restriction as
circumstances may seem to demand. At the present time there was but
one occupant of the chamber to greet Mr. Gilmore when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) entered,
and this greeting was made with all the full honours of commercial
courtesy. The commercial gentleman is of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nature gregarious, and
although he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) be exclusive to a strong degree, more so probably than
almost any other man in regard to the sacred hour of dinner, when
in the full glory of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confraternity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will condescend, when
the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) profession have separated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
professional brethren, to be festive with almost any gentleman whom
chance may throw in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way. Mr. Cockey had been alone for a whole
day when Gilmore arrived, having reached Loring just twenty-four
hours in advance of our friend, and was contemplating the sadly
diminished joys of a second solitary dinner at the Bull, when fortune
threw this stranger in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) way. The waiter, looking at the matter in
a somewhat similar light, and aware that a combined meal would be for
the advantage of all parties, very soon assisted Mr. Cockey in making
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) arrangements for the evening. Mr. Gilmore would no doubt want to
dine. Dinner would be served at five o'clock. Mr. Cockey was going to
dine, and Mr. Gilmore, the waiter thought, would probably be glad to
join him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). Mr. Cockey expressed himself as delighted, and would only
be too happy. Now men in love, let their case be ever so bad, must
dine or die. So much no doubt is not admitted by the chroniclers
of the old knights who went forth after their ladies; but the
old chroniclers, if they soared somewhat higher than do those
of the present day, are admitted to have been on the whole less
circumstantially truthful. Our knight was very sad at heart, and
would have done according to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) prowess as much as any Orlando of
them all for the lady whom he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) loved,--but nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was an
hungered; the mention of dinner was pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) accepted
the joint courtesies of Mr. Cockey and the waiter with gratitude.

<p/>The codfish and beefsteak, though somewhat woolly and tough, were
wholesome; and the pint of sherry which at Mr. Cockey's suggestion
was supplied to them, if not of itself wholesome, was innocent
by reason of its dimensions. Mr. Cockey himself was pleasant and
communicative, and told Mr. Gilmore a good deal about Loring. Our
friend was afraid to ask any leading questions as to the persons in
the place who interested himself, feeling conscious that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own
subject was one which would not bear touch from a rough hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did
at last venture to make inquiry about the clergyman of the parish.
Mr. Cockey, with some merriment at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) own wit, declared that the
church was a house of business at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) did not often call for
orders. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) had been coming to Loring now for four years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>)
had never heard anything of the clergyman; but the waiter no doubt
would tell them. Gilmore rather hesitated, and protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
cared little for the matter; but the waiter was called in and
questioned, and was soon full of stories about old Mr. Marrable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
was a good sort of man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) way, the waiter thought, but not much
of a preacher. The people liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) never interfered with
them. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) don't go poking his (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) nose into people's `ouses like some
of 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>said the waiter, who then began to tell of the pertinacity
in that respect of a younger clergyman at Uphill. Yes; Parson
Marrable had a relation living at Uphill; an old lady. <div class="bookquote">``No; not
his (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) grandmother.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cockey/Cockey</b></font>)</div>This was in answer to a joke on the part of Mr.
Cockey. Nor yet a daughter. The waiter thought she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was some kind of
a cousin, though he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) did not know what kind. A very grand lady was
Miss Marrable, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) showing, and much thought of by the
quality. There was a young lady living with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), though the waiter
did not know the young lady's name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does the Rev. Mr. Marrable live alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>asked Gilmore. <div class="bookquote">``Well, yes;
for the most part quite alone. But just at present he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had a visitor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>Then the waiter told all that he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) knew about the Captain. The most
material part of this was that the Captain had returned from London
that very evening;--had come in by the Express while the two <div class="bookquote">``gents''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>were at dinner, and had been taken to the Lowtown parsonage by the
Bull `bus. <div class="bookquote">``Quite the gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman the Captain</b></font>)</div>was the Captain, according to the
waiter, and one of the <div class="bookquote">``handsomest gents as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)'d set his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) eyes
upon.''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``D-- him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Gilmore/Gilmore</b></font>)</div>said poor Harry Gilmore to himself. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
ventured upon another question. Did the waiter know anything of
Captain Marrable's father? The waiter only knew that the Captain's
father was <div class="bookquote">``a military gent, and was high up in the army.''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain father</b></font>)</div>From all
which the only information which Gilmore received was the fact that
the match between Marrable and Mary Lowther had not as yet become the
talk of the town. After dinner Mr. Cockey proposed a glass of toddy
and a cigar, remarking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) would move a bill for dispensing
with the smoking rule for that night only, and to this also Gilmore
assented. Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was at Loring he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) did not know what to do with
himself better than drinking toddy with Mr. Cockey. Mr. Cockey
declared the bill to be carried nem. con., and the cigars and toddy
were produced. Mr. Cockey remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) had heard of Sir Gregory
Marrable, of Dunripple Park. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) travelled in Warwickshire, and was in
the habit, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said, of fishing up little facts. Sir Gregory wasn't
much of a man, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) account. The estate was small and,
as Mr. Cockey fancied, a little out at elbows. Mr. Cockey thought it
all very well to be a country gentleman and a <div class="bookquote">``barrow knight,''  (<font color='red'><b>a country gentleman knight</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>)
called it, as long as you had an estate to follow; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) thought
very little of a title without plenty of stuff. Commerce, according
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) notions, was the back bone of the nation;--and that the corps
of travelling commercial gentlemen was the back bone of trade, every
child knew. Mr. Cockey became warm and friendly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>)
toddy. <div class="bookquote">``Now, I don't know what you are, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not very much of anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not, sir. Let that be as it may. But a man, sir, that feels
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s one of the supports of the commercial supremacy of this
nation ain't got much reason to be ashamed of himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not on that account, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor yet on no other account, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s true to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) employers.
Now you talk of country gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't talk of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,--no,--you didn't; but they do, you know. What does a country
gentleman know, and what does he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) do? What's the country the better of
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) `unts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shoots, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) goes to bed with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) skin full
of wine, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gets up and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) `unts and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shoots again, and
`as his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) skin full once more. That's about all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s a magistrate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, justices' justice! we know all about that. Put an old man in
prison for a week because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) `ay-field on a Sunday; or
send a young one to the treadmill for two months because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knocks
over a `are! All them cases ought to be tried in the towns, and there
should be beaks paid as there is in London. I don't see the good of a
country gentleman. Buying and selling;--that's what the world has to
go by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They buy and sell land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; they don't. They buy a bit now and then when they're screws, and
they sell a bit now and then when the eating and drinking has gone
too fast. But as for capital and investment, they know nothing about
it. After all, they ain't getting above two-and-a-half per cent. for
their money. We all know what that must come to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cockey/Cockey</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cockey had been so mild before the pint of sherry and the glass
of toddy, that Mr. Gilmore was somewhat dismayed by the change. Mr.
Cockey, however, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) altered aspect seemed to be so much the less
gracious, that Gilmore left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) and strolled out into the town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
climbed up the hill and walked round the church and looked up at the
windows of Miss Marrable's house, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had learned the site;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had no adventure, saw nothing that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and at
half-past nine took himself wearily to bed.

<p/>That same day Captain Marrable had run down from London to Loring
laden with terrible news. The money on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had counted was all
gone! <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle; <div class="bookquote">``have the lawyers been
deceiving you all through?''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the ruined man. <div class="bookquote">``It is all gone. They have
satisfied me that nothing more can be done.''  (<font color='red'><b>Parson John/John/Parson</b></font>)</div>Parson John whistled
with a long-drawn note of wonder. <div class="bookquote">``The people they were dealing with
would be willing enough to give up the money, but it's all gone. It's
spent, and there's no trace of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow!''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: Parson John and Walter Marrable.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've seen my father, uncle John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what passed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was a scoundrel, and then I left him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). I didn't

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hope not that, Walter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I kept my hands off him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>); but when a man has ruined you as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has

are much the same to you then. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was worn, and old, and pale, or I
should have felled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what will you do now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just go to that hell upon earth on the other side of the globe.

and told them why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the uncle nephew</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing more was said that night between the uncle and nephew, and
no word had been spoken about Mary Lowther. On the next morning the
breakfast at the parsonage passed by in silence. Parson John had been
thinking a good deal of Mary, but had resolved that it was best that
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) should hold his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tongue for the present. From the moment in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had first heard of the engagement, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mind that
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nephew and Mary Lowther would never be married. Seeing what
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nephew was--or rather seeing that which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fancied his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nephew
to be,--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would not sacrifice himself by such a
marriage. There was always a way out of things, and Walter Marrable
would be sure to find it. The way out of it had been found now with
a vengeance. Immediately after breakfast the Captain took his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hat
without a word, and walked steadily up the hill to Uphill Lane. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) passed the door of the Bull he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) saw, but took no notice of, a
gentleman who was standing under the covered entrance to the inn, and
who had watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) coming out from the parsonage gate; but Gilmore,
the moment that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) eyes fell upon the Captain, declared to himself
that that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) rival. Captain Marrable walked straight up the
hill and knocked at Miss Marrable's door. Was Miss Lowther at home?
Of course Miss Lowther was at home at such an hour. The girl said
that Miss Mary was alone in the breakfast parlour. Miss Marrable had
already gone down to the kitchen. Without waiting for another word,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) walked into the little back room, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) love.
<div class="bookquote">``Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said, jumping up and running to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``how good of you
to come so soon! We didn't expect you these two days.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had thrown
herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) arms, but, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did not kiss
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``There is something the matter!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) drew away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) and looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) smiled
and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) head, still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) by the waist. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Walter;
I know there is something wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only that dirty money. My father has succeeded in getting it
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All, Walter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), again drawing herself away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every shilling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be very bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a doubt of it. I felt it just as you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And all our pretty plans are gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--all our pretty plans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what shall you do now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is only one thing. I shall go to India again. Of course it is

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not say it, my dear, when I feel it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't feel it. I know it must be bad for you, but it is not
quite that. I will not think that you have nothing left worth living

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can ask you to take me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said;--<div class="bookquote">``though perhaps it will be

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling!--my own darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) shoulders, and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) hand till it came again round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) waist. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) forehead, and smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) hair. <div class="bookquote">``Swear
to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that whatever happens you will not put me away

resolved that I would put you away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And even now I know that they will tell me that I should do so. How
can I take you out there to such a life as that without having the
means of keeping a house over your head?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Officers do marry without fortunes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--and what sort of a time do their wives have? Oh, Mary, my own,
my own, my own!--it is very bad! You cannot understand it all at
once, but it is very bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it be better for you, Walter,--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said, again drawing herself
away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not that, and do not say that it is. Let us at any rate trust
each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) gave herself a little shake before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I will
trust you in everything;--as God is my judge, in everything. What you
tell me to do, I will do. But, Walter, I will say one thing first.
I can look forward to nothing but absolute misery in any life that
will separate me from you. I know the difference between comfort and
discomfort in money matters, but all that is as a feather in the
balance. You are my god upon earth, and to you I must cling. Whether
you be away from me or with me, I must cling to you the same. If I
am to be separated from you for a time, I can do it with hope. If
I am to be separated from you for ever, I shall still do so,--with
despair. And now I will trust you, and I will do whatever you tell
me. If you forbid me to call you mine any longer,--I will obey, and
will never reproach you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will always be yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, dearest, you shall not find me wanting for anything you may
ask of me. Of course you can't decide at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have decided that I must go to India. I have asked for the
exchange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I understand; but about our marriage. It may be that you
should go out first. I would not be unmaidenly, Walter; but remember
this--the sooner the better, if I can be a comfort to you;--but I can
bear any delay rather than be a clog upon you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div><p/>Marrable, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had walked up the hill,--and during all his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) thoughts,
indeed, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had been convinced that the money was gone from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>),--had been disposed to think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) duty to Mary required him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wife when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) believed his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
circumstances to be other than they were; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) knew that the
life he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had to offer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was one of extreme discomfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had
endeavoured to shake off any idea that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) must go back to India it
would be more comfortable for himself to return without than with a
wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wanted to make the sacrifice of himself, and had determined
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would do so. Now, at any rate for the moment, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
resolves were thrown to the wind. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own love was so strong and was
so gratified by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) love, that half his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) misery was carried away in an
enthusiasm of romantic devotion. Let the worst come to the worst, the
man that was so loved by such a woman could not be of all men the
most miserable.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left the house, giving to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the charge of telling the bad news
to Miss Marrable; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw in the street before the
house the man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen standing an hour before under the
gateway of the inn. And Gilmore saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) too, and well knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
had been.




<p/>CHAPTER XXX.

<p/>THE AUNT AND THE UNCLE.


<p/>Miss Marrable heard the story of the Captain's loss in perfect
silence. Mary told it craftily, with a smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face, as though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were but slightly affected by it, and did not think very much on
the change it might effect in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) plans and those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lover. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
has been ill-treated; has he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very badly treated. I can't understand it, but it seems to me that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) has been most shamefully treated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) tried to explain it all to me; but I don't know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
succeeded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did the lawyers deceive him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was a little rash there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) took what they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) for
more than it was worth. There was some woman who said that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
resign her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) claim; but when they came to look into it, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) too had
signed some papers and the money was all gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) could recover it
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) father by law, only that his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) father has got nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that is to be the end of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the end of our five thousand pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, forcing
a little laugh. Miss Marrable for a few moments made no reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
sat fidgety in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) seat, feeling that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) duty to explain to
Mary what must, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opinion, be the inevitable result of this
misfortune, and yet not knowing how to begin her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) task. Mary was
partly aware of what was coming, and had fortified herself to reject
all advice, to assert her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) right to do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pleased with herself,
and to protest that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cared nothing for the prudent views of
worldly-minded people. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was afraid of what was coming. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
knew that arguments would be used which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would find it very
difficult to answer; and, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had settled upon certain
strong words which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be
driven at last to quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt. On one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was quite
resolved. Nothing should induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) engagement,--short
of the expression of a wish to that effect from Walter Marrable
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How will this affect you, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Marrable at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have been a poor man's wife any how. Now I shall be the
wife of a very poor man. I suppose that will be the effect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has, aunt, made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind to go to India.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind to anything else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I know what you mean, aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you not know? I mean, that a man going out to India, and
intending to live there as an officer on his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) pay, cannot be in want
of a wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak of a wife as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were the same as a coach-and-four, or
a box at the opera,--a sort of luxury for rich men. Marriage, aunt,
is like death, common to all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In our position in life, Mary, marriage cannot be made so common as
to be undertaken without foresight for the morrow. A poor gentleman
is further removed from marriage than any other man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One knows, of course, that there will be difficulties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I mean, Mary, is, that you will have to give it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, Aunt Sarah. I shall never give it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that you will marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now, at once, and go out to
India with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as a dead weight round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall choose about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is for you to choose, Mary. Don't be angry. I am bound to tell
you what I think. You can, of course, act as you please; but I think
that you ought to listen to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot go back from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) engagement
without laying himself open to imputation of bad conduct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor can I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, dear. That depends, I think, upon what passes between
you. It is at any rate for you to propose the release to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--not to
fix him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the burthen of proposing it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>Mary's heart quailed as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) heard this, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did not show her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) feeling by any expression
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``For a man, placed as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, about to return to such a
climate as that of India, with such work before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as I suppose men
have there,--the burden of a wife, without the means of maintaining
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) according to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) views of life and hers--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have no views of life. We know that we shall be poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the old story of love and a cottage,--only under the most
unfavourable circumstances. A woman's view of it is, of course,
different from that of a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has seen more of the world, and
knows better than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does what poverty and a wife and family mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no reason why we should be married at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A long engagement for you would be absolutely disastrous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, there is disaster,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``The loss of Walter's
money is disastrous. One has to put up with disaster. But the worst
of all disasters would be to be separated. I can stand anything but
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me, Mary, that within the last few weeks your character
has become altogether altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You used to think so much more of other people than yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), Aunt Sarah?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As of a thing of your own. Two months ago you did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and
now you are a millstone round his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) neck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will never be a millstone round anybody's neck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary,
walking out of the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt had been very cruel
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),--had attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) misery without mercy; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
knew that every word that had been uttered had been spoken in pure
affection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt's chief purpose had been
to save Walter from the fruits of an imprudent marriage. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
so believed, the words would have had more effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw,
or thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt was trying to save herself
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own will, and at this she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was indignant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
determined to persevere; and this endeavour to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feel that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) perseverance would be disastrous to the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) loved was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
thought, very cruel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stalked upstairs with unruffled demeanour;
but when there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) threw herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bed and sobbed bitterly.
Could it be that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) duty, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sake, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the
whole thing should be at an end? It was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to do so
now, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had sworn to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be guided altogether
by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present troubles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) word to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
whatever happened; but of this she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was quite sure,--that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should
show the slightest sign of a wish to be free from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) engagement,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) free--at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) free, and would
never allow herself to think for a moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been wrong.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own feelings were very plainly,--perhaps,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) enthusiasm, too plainly,--and now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must judge for himself
and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). In respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would endeavour to avoid
any further conversation on the subject till her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lover should have
decided finally what would be best for both of them. If he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) should
choose to say that everything between them should be over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would
acquiesce,--and all the world should be over for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at the same
time.

<p/>While this was going on in Uphill Lane something of the same kind was
taking place at the Lowtown Parsonage. Parson John became aware that
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nephew had been with the ladies at Uphill, and when the young
man came in for lunch, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked some question which introduced the
subject. <div class="bookquote">``You've told them of this fresh trouble, no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't see Miss Marrable,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that Miss Marrable much signifies. You haven't asked
Miss Marrable to be your wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw Mary, and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you made no bones about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that you two had had your little game of play,
like two children, and that there must be an end of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I didn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what you have got to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in some kind of language, and
the sooner you do it the better. Of course you can't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). You
couldn't have done it if this money had been all right, and it's out
of the question now. Bless my soul! how you would hate each other
before six months were over. I can understand that for a strong
fellow like you, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s used to it, India may be a jolly place
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a great deal more than I can understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But for a poor man with a wife and family;--oh dear! it must be very
bad indeed. And neither of you have ever been used to that kind of
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor has she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). That old lady up there is not rich, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is as proud
as Lucifer, and always lives as though the whole place belonged to
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s a good manager, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) don't run in debt;--but Mary
Lowther knows no more of roughing it than a duchess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I may never have to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust you never may. It's a very bad lesson for a young man
to have to teach a young woman. Some women die in the learning.
Some won't learn it at all. Others do, and become dirty and rough
themselves. Now, you are very particular about women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to see them well turned out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you think of your own wife, nursing perhaps a couple of
babies, dressed nohow when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gets up in the morning, and going on
in the same way till night? That's the kind of life with officers who
marry on their pay. I don't say anything against it. If the man likes
it,--or rather if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s able to put up with it,--it may be all very
well; but you couldn't put up with it. Mary's very nice now, but
you'd come to be so sick of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), that you'd feel half like cutting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) throat,--or your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be the latter for choice, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it would. But even that isn't a pleasant thing to look
forward to. I'll tell you the truth about it, my boy. When you first
came to me and told me that you were going to marry Mary Lowther, I
knew it could not be. It was no business of mine; but I knew it could
not be. Such engagements always get themselves broken off somehow.
Now and again there are a pair of fools who go through with it;--but
for the most part it's a matter of kissing and lovers' vows for a
week or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to know all about it, Uncle John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't lived to be seventy without knowing something, I suppose.
And now here you are without a shilling. I dare say, if the truth
were known, you've a few debts here and there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may owe three or four hundred pounds or so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As much as a year's income;--and you talk of marrying a girl without
a farthing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has twelve hundred pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just enough to pay your own debts, and take you out to India,--so
that you may start without a penny. Is that the sort of career that
will suit you, Walter? Can you trust yourself to that kind of thing,
with a wife under your arm? If you were a man of fortune, no doubt
Mary would make a very nice wife; but, as it is,--you must give it
up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Whereupon Captain Marrable lit a pipe and took himself into the
parson's garden, thence into the stables and stable-yard, and again
back to the garden, thinking of all this. There was not a word spoken
by Parson John which Walter did not know to be true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had already
come to the conclusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) must go out to India before he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
married. As for marrying Mary at once and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) this
winter, that was impossible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) must go and look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>);--and as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) thought of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was forced to acknowledge to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
regarded the delay as a reprieve. The sooner the better had been
Mary's view with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was loath enough to entertain the
idea of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was obliged to confess that, like the
condemned man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) desired a long day. There was nothing happy before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) in the whole prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) life. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) loved Mary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very dearly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so dearly, that to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) taken
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would be to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) heart plucked asunder. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) swore to
himself;--and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was in doubt whether it would not be better that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) heart should be plucked asunder, than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should be made to
live in accordance with those distasteful pictures which his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) uncle
had drawn for him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). Of himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would not think at all. Everything
must be bad for him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). What happiness could a man expect who had been
misused, cheated, and mined by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own father? For himself it did not
much matter what became of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to doubt whether for
Mary's sake it would not be well that they should be separated. And
then Mary had thrust upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the whole responsibility of a decision!




<p/>CHAPTER XXXI.

<p/>MARY LOWTHER FEELS HER WAY.


<p/>That afternoon there came down to the parsonage a note from Mary to
the Captain, asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lover to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) before
dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and they took their accustomed stroll along the
towing-path and into the fields. Mary had thought much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt's
words before the note was written, and had a fixed purpose of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own
in view. It was true enough that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) loved this man with all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart and soul, so loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not look forward to
life apart from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without seeing that such life would be a great
blank, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hardly knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). We are apt to
suppose that love should follow personal acquaintance; and yet love
at third sight is probably as common as any love at all, and it takes
a great many sights before one human being can know another. Years
are wanted to make a friendship, but days suffice for men and women
to get married. Mary was, after a fashion, aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been
too quick in giving away her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart, and that now, when the gift had
been made in full, it became her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) business to learn what sort of man
was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had given it. And it was not only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature as
it affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature as it affected himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
must study. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not doubt but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was good, and true, and
noble-minded; but it might be possible that a man good, true, and
noble-minded, might have lived with so many indulgences around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
as to be unable to achieve the constancy of heart which would be
necessary for such a life as that which would be now before them if
they married. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should decide for himself
and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) also,--thus throwing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the responsibility, and
throwing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also, very probably, the necessity of a sacrifice.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had meant to be generous and trusting; but it might be that of
all courses that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had adopted was the least generous. In
order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might put this wrong right, if there were a wrong,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to come and walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). They met at the usual
spot, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) accustomed smile,
leaning upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) somewhat heavily for a minute, as girls do when they
want to show that they claim the arm that they lean on as their own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you told Parson John?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just what a crabbed, crafty, selfish old bachelor of seventy would
be sure to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) has told you to give up all idea of comforting
yourself with a wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Aunt Sarah has been saying exactly the same to me. You can't
think how eloquent Aunt Sarah has been. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) energy has quite
surprised me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think Aunt Sarah was ever much of a friend of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said
the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the way of matrimony; in other respects she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) approves of you
highly, and is rather proud of you as a Marrable. If you were only
heir to the title, or something of that kind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would think you the
finest fellow going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), with all my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) is such a dear old creature! You don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) in the least,
Walter. I am told she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was ever so pretty when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was a girl; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
had no fortune of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) own at that time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) didn't care to marry
beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) position. You mustn't abuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) has been saying I am sure is very true; and I dare say
Parson John has been saying the same thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) has caused you to change your mind, say so at once, Mary. I
shan't complain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arm involuntarily, and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) so dearly for the
little burst of wrath. Was it really true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), too, had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
heart upon it?--that all that the crafty old uncle had said had been
of no avail?--that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) also loved so well that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was willing to
change the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) life and become another person for the
sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)? If it were so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not say a word that could by
possibility make him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was afraid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
way carefully, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) might not be led by a chance phrase to
imagine that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was about to say was said on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own behalf.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be very careful, but at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be so
explicit that there should be no doubt on his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mind but that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) full permission to retire from the engagement if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) thought it
best to do so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was quite ready to share the burthens of life with
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), let them be what they might; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not be a mill-stone
round his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) neck. At any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) should not be weighted with the
mill-stone, if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) himself looked upon a loving wife in that light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has not caused me to change my mind at all, Walter. Of course I
know that all this is very serious. I knew that without Aunt Sarah's
telling me. After all, Aunt Sarah can't be so wise as you ought to
be, who have seen India and who know it well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``India is not a nice place to live in--especially for women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that Loring is very nice;--but one has to take that as
it comes. Of course it would be nicer if you could live at home and
have plenty of money. I wish I had a fortune of my own. I never cared
for it before, but I do now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Things don't come by wishing, Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but things do come by resolving and struggling. I have no doubt
but that you will live yet to do something and to be somebody. I have
that faith in you. But I can well understand that a wife may be a
great impediment in your way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to think of myself at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must think of yourself. For a woman, after all, it doesn't
matter much. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) isn't expected to do anything particular. A man
of course must look to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own career, and take care that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does
nothing to mar it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite understand what you're driving at,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--I'm driving at this: that I think that you are bound to
decide upon doing that which you feel to be wisest without reference
to my feelings. Of course I love you better than anything in the
world. I can't be so false as to say it isn't so. Indeed, to tell the
truth, I don't know that I really ever loved anybody else. But if it
is proper that we should be separated, I shall get over it,--in a
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean you'd marry somebody else in the process of time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Walter; I don't mean that. Women shouldn't make protestations;
but I don't think I ever should. But a woman can live and get on very
well without being married, and I should always have you in my heart,
and I should try to comfort myself with remembering that you had
loved me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite sure that I shall never marry anyone else,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the
Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what I'm driving at now;--eh, Walter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Partly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to know wholly. I told you this morning that I should
leave it to you to decide. I still say the same. I consider myself
for the present as much bound to obey you as though I were your wife
already. But after saying that, and after hearing Aunt Mary's sermon,
I felt that I ought to make you understand that I am quite aware
that it may be impossible for you to keep to your engagement. You
understand all that better than I do. Our engagement was made when
you thought you had money, and even then you felt that there was
little enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now there is none. I don't profess to be afraid of poverty
myself, because I don't quite know what it means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It means something very unpleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt; and it would be unpleasant to be parted;--wouldn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be horrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arm again as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``You must judge between the
two. What I want you to understand is this, that whatever you may
judge to be right and best, I will agree to it, and will think that
it is right and best. If you say that we will get ourselves married
and try it, I shall feel that not to get ourselves married and not to
try it is a manifest impossibility; and if you say that we should be
wrong to get married and try it, then I will feel that to have done
so was quite a manifest impossibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you're an angel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I'm a woman who loves well enough to be determined not to
hurt the man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loves if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is one thing on which I think we must decide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must at any rate go out before we are married.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>Mary Lowther felt
this to be a decision in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) favour,--to be a decision which for the
time made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) happy and light-hearted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had so dreaded a positive
and permanent separation, that the delay seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to be hardly
an evil.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXII.

<p/>MR. GILMORE``S SUCCESS.


<p/>Harry Gilmore, the prosperous country gentleman, the county
magistrate, the man of acres, the nephew of Mr. Chamberlaine,
respected by all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>),--with the single exception of the
Marquis of Trowbridge,--was now so much reduced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) felt himself
to be an inferior being to Mr. Cockey, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) breakfasted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>)
had come to Loring, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) was there he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) did not know what to do
with himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) had come there, in truth, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) really
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) could do any good, but driven out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) home by sheer
misery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) was a man altogether upset, and verging on to a species of
insanity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) was so uneasy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) could read nothing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) was half-ashamed of being looked at by those who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>); and
had felt some relief in the society of Mr. Cockey till Mr. Cockey
had become jovial with wine, simply because Mr. Cockey was so poor a
creature that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) felt no fear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>). But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) had come to Loring,
it was necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) should do something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) could not come to
Loring and go back again without saying a word to anybody. Fenwick
would ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) questions, and the truth would come out. There came
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) this morning an idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would not go back home;--that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would leave Loring and go away without giving any reason to any
one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) own master. No one would be injured by anything
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) might do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) had a right to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) income as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) pleased.
Everything was distasteful that reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) of Bullhampton. But
still he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) knew that this was no more than a madman's idea;--that it
would ill become him (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) so to act. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) had duties to perform, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) must
perform them, let them be ever so distasteful. It was only an idea,
made to be rejected; but, nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) thought of it.

<p/>To do something, however, was incumbent on him (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>). After breakfast he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>)
sauntered up the hill and saw Captain Marrable enter the house in
which Mary Lowther lived. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) felt thoroughly ashamed of himself
in thus creeping about, and spying things out,--and, in truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
had not intended thus to watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) rival. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wandered into the
churchyard, sat there sometime on the tombstones, and then again went
down to the inn. Mr. Cockey was going to Gloucester by an afternoon
train, and invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) to join an early dinner at two. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) assented,
though by this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) had come to hate Mr. Cockey. Mr. Cockey
assumed an air of superiority, and gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) opinions about matters
political and social as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) companion were considerably below
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) in intelligence and general information. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) dictated to poor
Gilmore, and laid down the law as to eating onions with beefsteaks
in a manner that was quite offensive. Nevertheless, the unfortunate
man bore with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tormentor, and felt desolate when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was left
alone in the commercial room, Cockey having gone out to complete
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) last round of visits to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) customers. <div class="bookquote">``Orders first and money
afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cockey/Cockey</b></font>)</div>Cockey had said, and Cockey had now gone out to look
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Cockey</b></font>) money.

<p/>Gilmore sat for some half-hour helpless over the fire; and then
starting up, snatched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) hat, and hurried out of the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
walked as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could up the hill, and rang the bell at Miss
Marrable's house. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) been there ten minutes sooner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would have
seen Mary Lowther tripping down the side path to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) lover. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
rang the bell, and in a few minutes found himself in Miss Marrable's
drawing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had asked for Miss Marrable, had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) name, and
had been shown upstairs. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) remained alone for a few minutes
which seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) to be interminable. During these minutes Miss
Marrable was standing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) little parlour downstairs, trying to
think what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would say to Mr. Gilmore,--trying also to think why
Mr. Gilmore should have come to Loring.

<p/>After a few words of greeting Miss Marrable said that Miss Lowther
was out walking. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) will be very glad, I'm sure, to hear good news
from her (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) friends at Bullhampton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're all very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've heard a great deal of Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Marrable; <div class="bookquote">``so
much that I seem almost to be acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your parish has become painfully known to the public by that
horrible murder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Marrable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear that they will hardly catch the perpetrator of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Marrable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore.

<p/>At this period of the conversation Miss Marrable found herself in
great difficulty. If anything was to be said about Mary Lowther, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
could not begin to say it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had heard a great deal in favour of
Mr. Gilmore. Mrs. Fenwick had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) about the man; and Mary,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), had always spoken very highly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
qualities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had gone through Oxford with credit,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was a reading man,--so reputed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was a magistrate, and
in all respects a gentleman. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had formed an idea of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) as
quite a pearl among men. Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not repress
a feeling of disappointment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was badly dressed, and bore a sad,
depressed, downtrodden aspect. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) whole appearance was what the
world now calls seedy. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) seemed to be almost unable to speak.
Miss Marrable knew that Mr. Gilmore was a man disappointed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
love, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did not conceive that love had done him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) all these
injuries. Love, however, had done them all. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going to stay
long in this neighbourhood?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Marrable, almost in despair
for a subject.

<p/>Then the man's mouth was opened. <div class="bookquote">``No; I suppose not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't know what should keep me here, and I hardly know why I'm come.
Of course you have heard of my suit to your niece.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>Miss Marrable
bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) courtly little head in token of assent. <div class="bookquote">``When Miss Lowther
left us, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) gave me some hope that I might be successful. At least,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) consented that I should ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) once more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) has now written to
tell me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is something of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Marrable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something of the kind! I suppose it is settled; isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Marrable was a sensible woman, one not easily led away by
appearances. Nevertheless, it is probable that had Mr. Gilmore been
less lugubrious, more sleek, less <div class="bookquote">``seedy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would have been more
prone than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) now was to have made instant use of Captain Marrable's
loss of fortune on behalf of this other suitor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would immediately
have felt that perhaps something might be done, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would have
been tempted to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) the whole story openly. As it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could
not so sympathise with the man before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), as to take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
confidence. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Mr. Gilmore, the favoured friend of the
Fenwicks, the owner of the Privets, and the man of whom Mary had
often said that there was no fault to be found with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But there
was nothing bright about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know how to encourage
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a lover. <div class="bookquote">``As Mary has told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose there
can be no harm in my repeating that they are engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Marrable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they are. I am aware of that. I believe the gentleman is
related to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a cousin,--not very near.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has your good will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that, Mr. Gilmore, I don't know that I can do any good by
speaking. Young ladies in these days don't marry in accordance with
the wishes of their old aunts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Miss Lowther thinks so much of you! I don't want to ask any
questions that ought not to be asked. If this match is so settled
that it must go on, why there's an end of it. I'll just tell you the
truth openly, Miss Marrable. I have loved,--I do love your niece with
all my heart. When I received her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) letter it upset me altogether, and
every hour since has made the feeling worse. I have come here just
to learn whether there may still possibly be a chance. You will not
quarrel with me because I have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) so well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Marrable, whose heart was gradually becoming
soft, and who was learning to forget the mud on Mr. Gilmore's boots
and trousers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard that Captain Marrable was,--at any rate, not a very rich
man; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could hardly afford to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) cousin. I did hear,
also, that the match might in other respects not be suitable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no other objection, Mr. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the case, Miss Marrable, that these things sometimes come
on suddenly and go off suddenly. I won't deny that if I could
have gained Miss Lowther's heart without the interference of any
interloper, it would have been to me a brighter joy than anything
that can now be possible. A man cannot be proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position who
seeks to win a woman who owns a preference for another man.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>Miss
Marrable's heart had now become very soft, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) began to perceive,
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own knowledge, that Mr. Gilmore was at any rate a gentleman.
<div class="bookquote">``But I would take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in any way that I could get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Perhaps--that
is to say, it might be--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) stopped.

<p/>Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) everything? She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had a strong idea that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
first duty to be true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own sex and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own niece. But were
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) to tell the man the whole story it would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) niece no harm.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) still believed that the match with Captain Marrable must be
broken off. Even were this done it would be very long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) thought,
before Mary would bring herself to listen with patience to another
suitor. But of course it would be best for them all that this episode
in Mary's life should be forgotten and put out of sight as soon as
possible. Had not this dangerous captain come up, Mary, no doubt,--so
thought Miss Marrable,--would at last have complied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) friends'
advice, and have accepted a marriage which was in all respects
advantageous. If the episode could only get itself forgotten and put
out of sight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) might do so still. But there must be delay. Miss
Marrable, after waiting for half a minute to consider, determined
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) something. <div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Captain
Marrable's income is so small that the match is one that Mary's
friends cannot approve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think much of money,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still it is essential to comfort, Mr. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I mean to say is, that I am the last man in the world to insist
upon that kind of thing, or to appear to triumph because my income is
larger than another man's.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>Miss Marrable was now quite sure that Mr.
Gilmore was a gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``But if the match is to be broken off--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say that it will be broken off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it may be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly it is possible. There are difficulties which may
necessarily separate them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it be so, my feelings will be the same as they have always been
since I first knew her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). That is all that I have got to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) pretty nearly everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said nothing of the
money which Walter Marrable would have inherited had it not been for
Colonel Marrable's iniquity; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) that the young
people would have no income except the Captain's pay, and poor Mary's
little fifty pounds a-year; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went on to explain that, as
far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was concerned, and as far as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin the clergyman
was concerned, everything would be done to prevent a marriage so
disastrous as that in question, and the prospect of a life with so
little of allurement as that of the wife of a poor soldier in India.
At the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) remember that Mary Lowther was a girl
very apt to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own judgment, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was for the present
absolutely devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``I think it will be broken off,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That is my opinion. I don't think it can go on. But it is
he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) that will do it; and for a time she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will suffer greatly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore. <div class="bookquote">``I will go home, and wait
again. If there be a chance, I can live and hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God grant that you may not hope in vain!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would do my best to make her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) happy. I will leave you now, and am
very thankful for your kindness. There would be no good in my seeing
Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not, Mr. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would only feel that I was teasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). You will
not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) of my being here, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would do no good, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None in the least. I'll just go home and wait. If there should be
anything to tell me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If the match be broken off, I will take care that you shall hear it.
I will write to Janet Fenwick. I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) is your friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Gilmore left the house, descended the hill without seeing
Mary, packed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) things, and returned by the night train to
Westbury. At seven o'clock in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) reached home in a
Westbury gig, very cold, but upon the whole, a much more comfortable
man than when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had almost brought himself to think
that even yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would succeed at last.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII.

<p/>FAREWELL.


<p/>Christmas came, and a month beyond Christmas, and by the end of
January Captain Marrable and Miss Lowther had agreed to regard
all their autumn work as null and void,--to look back upon the
love-making as a thing that had not been, and to part as friends.
Both of them suffered much in this arrangement,--the man being the
louder in the objurgations which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ill-fortune, and
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assurances to himself and others that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ruined for life.
And, indeed, no man could have been much more unhappy than was Walter
Marrable in these days. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was added the trouble, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did
not endeavour to hide from himself or Mary, that all this misery
came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own father. Before the end of November, sundry
renewed efforts were made to save a portion of the money, and the
lawyers descended so low as to make an offer to take L2000. They
might have saved themselves the humiliation, for neither L2000 nor
L200 could have been made to be forthcoming. Walter Marrable, when
the time came, was painfully anxious to fight somebody; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was
told very clearly by Messrs. Block and Curling, that there was nobody
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could fight but his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) father, and that even by fighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would never obtain a penny. <div class="bookquote">``My belief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Curling,
<div class="bookquote">``is, that you could put your father in prison, but that probably is
not your object.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Marrable was forced to own that that was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
object; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did so in a tone which seemed to imply that a prison,
were it even for life, would be the best place for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) father. Block
and Curling had been solicitors to the Marrables for ever so many
years; and though they did not personally love the Colonel, they
had a professional feeling that the blackness of a black sheep of a
family should not be made public, at any rate by the family itself
or by the family solicitors. Almost every family has a black sheep,
and it is the especial duty of a family solicitor to keep the family
black sheep from being dragged into the front and visible ranks
of the family. The Captain had been fatally wrong in signing the
paper which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had signed, and must take the consequences. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
think, Captain Marrable, that you would save yourself in any way by
proceeding against the Colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Curling. <div class="bookquote">``I have not the
slightest intention of proceeding against him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain, in
great dudgeon,--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) left the office and shook the dust off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) feet, as against Block and Curling as well as against his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father.

<p/>After this,--immediately after it,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had one other interview with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) uncle, the devil prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to go down
to Portsmouth to see the man to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) interests should have been
dearer than to all the world beside, and who had robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) so
ruthlessly. There was nothing to be gained by such a visit. Neither
money nor counsel, nor even consolation would be forthcoming from
Colonel Marrable. Probably Walter Marrable felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) anger that
it would be unjust that his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) father should escape without a word to
remind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son's mouth of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son.
The Colonel held some staff office at Portsmouth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) son came
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) lodgings one evening as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was dressing to go out
to dinner. <div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Walter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the reprobate</b></font>)</div>said the battered old reprobate,
appearing at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) bed-room; <div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the reprobate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--what would you have me say? If you'll only behave decently, I
shall be glad to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've given me an example in that way, sir; have you not? Decency
indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Walter, if you're going to talk about that horrid money, I tell
you at once, that I won't listen to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's kind of you, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been unfortunate. As soon as I can repay it, or a part of it,
I will. Since you've been back, I've done everything in my power to
get a portion of it for you,--and should have got it, but for those
stupid people in Bedford Row. After all, the money ought to have been
mine, and that's what I suppose you felt when you enabled me to draw
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By heavens, that's cool!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to be cool;--I'm always cool. The cab will be here to take
me to dinner in a very few minutes. I hope you will not think I am
running away from you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean you to go till you've heard what I've got to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said
the Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, pray say it quickly.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>Upon this, the Colonel stood still and
faced his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) son; not exactly with a look of anger, but assuming an
appearance as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) were the person injured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was a thin old
man, who wore padded coats, and painted his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) beard and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) eyebrows,
and had false teeth, and who, in spite of chronic absence of means,
always was possessed of clothes apparently just new from the hands of
a West-end tailor. He (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) was one of those men who, through their long,
useless, ill-flavoured lives, always contrive to live well, to eat
and drink of the best, to lie softly, and to go about in purple
and fine linen,--and yet, never have any money. Among a certain
set Colonel Marrable, though well known, was still popular. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was
good-tempered, well-mannered, sprightly in conversation, and had not
a scruple in the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was over seventy, had lived hard, and must
have known that there was not much more of it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). But yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
had no qualms, and no fears. It may be doubted whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) knew that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was a bad man,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), than whom you could find none worse though
you were to search the country from one end to another. To lie, to
steal,--not out of tills or pockets, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) knew the danger; to
cheat--not at the card-table, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had never come in the way
of learning the lesson; to indulge every passion, though the cost to
others might be ruin for life; to know no gods but his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own bodily
senses, and no duty but that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) owed to those gods; to eat all,
and produce nothing; to love no one but himself; to have learned
nothing but how to sit at table like a gentleman; to care not at all
for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) country, or even for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) profession; to have no creed, no
party, no friend, no conscience, to be troubled with nothing that
touched his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heart;--such had been, was, and was to be the life of
Colonel Marrable. Perhaps it was accounted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) as a merit by some
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did not quail at any coming fate. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) doctor warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) must go soon, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would refrain from this and that
and the other,--so wording his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) caution that the Colonel could not
but know and did know, that let him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) refrain as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) must go
soon,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would refrain, thinking that the charms
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wretched life were sweet enough to be worth such sacrifice;
but in no other respect did the caution affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) never asked
himself whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had aught even to regret before he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) died, or to
fear afterwards.

<p/>There are many Colonel Marrables about in the world, known well to be
so at clubs, in drawing-rooms, and by the tradesmen who supply them.
Men give them dinners and women smile upon them. The best of coats
and boots are supplied to them. They never lack cigars nor champagne.
They have horses to ride, and servants to wait upon them more
obsequious than the servants of other people. And men will lend them
money too,--well knowing that there is no chance of repayment. Now
and then one hears a horrid tale of some young girl who surrenders
herself to such a one, absolutely for love! Upon the whole the
Colonel Marrables are popular. It is hard to follow such a man quite
to the end and to ascertain whether or no he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does go out softly at
last, like the snuff of a candle,--just with a little stink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will say it as quickly as I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain. <div class="bookquote">``I can gain
nothing I know by staying here in your company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not while you are so very uncivil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Civil, indeed! I have to-day made up my mind, not for your sake, but
for that of the family, that I will not prosecute you as a criminal
for the gross robbery which you have perpetrated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is nonsense, Walter, and you know it as well as I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going back to India in a few weeks, and I trust I may never be
called upon to see you again. I will not, if I can help it. It may
be a toss-up which of us may die first, but this will be our last
meeting. I hope you may remember on your death-bed that you have
utterly ruined your son in every relation of life. I was engaged to
marry a girl,--whom I loved; but it is all over, because of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had heard of that, Walter, and I really congratulate you on your
escape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't strike you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; don't do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because of your age, and because you are my father. I suppose you
have no heart, and that I cannot make you feel it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy, I have an appetite, and I must go and satisfy it.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>So
saying the Colonel escaped, and the Captain allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father to
make his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) way down the stairs and into the cab before he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) followed.

<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had thus spoken to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) blasted hopes in
regard to Mary Lowther, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had not as yet signified his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) consent to
the measure by which their engagement was to be brought altogether
to an end. The question had come to be discussed widely among their
friends, as is the custom with such questions in such circumstances,
and Mary had been told from all sides that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was bound to give it
up,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was bound to give it up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own sake, and more
especially for his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>); that the engagement, if continued, would never
lead to a marriage, and that it would in the meantime be absolutely
ruinous to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),--and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). Parson John came up and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
with a strength for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not hitherto given Parson John
credit. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Aunt Sarah was very gentle with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), but never veered
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) opinion that the engagement must of necessity be abandoned.
Mr. Fenwick wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) a letter full of love and advice, and Mrs.
Fenwick made a journey to Loring to discuss the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). The
discussion between them was very long. <div class="bookquote">``If you are saying this on my
account,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``it is quite useless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On what other account? Mr. Gilmore? Indeed, indeed, I am not
thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is out of my mind altogether. I say it because I
know it is impossible that you and your cousin should be married, and
because such an engagement is destructive to both the parties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``it can make no difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will make the greatest difference. It would wear you to pieces
with a deferred hope. There is nothing so killing, so terrible, so
much to be avoided. And then for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)!-- How is a man, thrown about on
the world as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be, to live in such a condition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>The upshot of it all was that Mary wrote a letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin
proposing to surrender her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) engagement, and declaring that it would be
best for them both that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should agree to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) surrender. That
plan which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had adopted before, of leaving all the responsibility
to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), would not suffice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had come to perceive during these
weary discussions that if a way out of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) bondage was to be given to
Walter Marrable it must come from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) action and not from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had intended to be generous when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) left everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>); but it
was explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), both by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt and Mrs. Fenwick, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
generosity was of a kind which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could not use. It was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to
take the responsibility upon herself; it was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to make the
move; it was, in short, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to say that the engagement should be
over.

<p/>The very day that Mrs. Fenwick left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wrote the letter, and
Captain Marrable had it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) pocket when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) went down to bid a
last farewell to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) father. It had been a sad, weary, tear-laden
performance,--the writing of that letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had resolved that
no sign of a tear should be on the paper, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had rubbed the
moisture away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) eyes a dozen times during the work lest it
should fall. There was but little of intended pathos in it; there
were no expressions of love till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) at the end that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
would always love him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) dearly; there was no repining,--no mention of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own misery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) used all the arguments which others had used to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), and then drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) conclusion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) remembered that were she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would still be true to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would in fact be
asking for some such pledge back from him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said not a word
of any such constancy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own part. It was best for both of them
that the engagement should be broken off; and, therefore, broken off
it was, and should be now and for ever. That was the upshot of Mary
Lowther's letter.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Mary Lowther writes to Walter Marrable.-RSB-


<p/>Captain Marrable when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) received it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) acknowledged the
truth of all the arguments, loved the girl far too well to feel that
this release gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) any comfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had doubtless felt that the
engagement was a burthen on him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>),--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would not have entered into
it had he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) not felt sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) diminished fortune, and that there
was a fearful probability that it might never result in their being
married; but not the less did the breaking up of it make him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) very
wretched. An engagement for marriage can never be so much to a man as
it is to a woman,--marriage itself can never be so much, can never
be so great a change, produce such utter misery, or of itself be
efficient for such perfect happiness,--but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love was true and
steadfast, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learned that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as
a man who had been robbed of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) treasure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) letter was long and
argumentative. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reply was short and passionate;--and the reader
shall see it.


<p/>Duke Street, January, 186--.

<p/>DEAREST MARY,

<p/>I suppose you are right. Everybody tells me so, and no
doubt everybody tells you the same. The chances are that
I shall get bowled over; and as for getting back again, I
don't know when I can hope for it. In such a condition it
would I believe be very wrong and selfish were I to go and
leave you to think of me as your future husband. You would
be waiting for that which would never come.

<p/>As for me, I shall never care for any other woman. A
soldier can get on very well without a wife, and I shall
always regard myself now as one of those useless but
common animals who are called <div class="bookquote">``not marrying men.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shall
never marry. I shall always carry your picture in my
heart, and shall not think that I am sinning against you
or any one else when I do so after hearing that you are
married.

<p/>I need not tell you that I am very wretched. It is not
only that I am separated from you, my own dear, dearest
girl, but that I cannot refrain from thinking how it has
come to pass that it is so. I went down to see my father
yesterday. I did see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and you may imagine of what
nature was the interview. I sometimes think, when I lie in
bed, that no man was ever so ill-treated as I have been.

<p/>Dearest love, good-bye. I could not have brought myself to
say what you have said, but I know that you are right. It
has not been my fault, dear. I did love you, and do love
you as truly as any man ever loved a woman.

<p/>Yours with all my heart,

<p/>WALTER MARRABLE.

<p/>I should like to see you once more before I start. Is
there any harm in this? I must run down to my uncle's, but
I will not go up to you if you think it better not. If you
can bring yourself to see me, pray, pray do.


<p/>In answer to this Mary wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would certainly
see him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) came. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew no reason, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, why they should
not meet. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had written her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) note she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt's opinion.
Aunt Sarah would not take upon herself to say that no such meeting
ought to take place, but it was very evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) thought that it
would be dangerous.

<p/>Captain Marrable did come down to Loring about the end of January,
and the meeting did take place. Mary had stipulated that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should
be alone when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) called. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had suggested that they should walk out
together, as had been their wont; but this she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had declined, telling
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) that the sadness of such a walk would be too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and
saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt with a smile that were she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) once again out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
on the towing-path, there would be no chance of their ever coming
home. <div class="bookquote">``I could not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to turn back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when I should
know that it would be for the last time.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was arranged, therefore,
that the meeting should take place in the drawing-room at Uphill
Lane.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) came into the room with a quick, uneasy step, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) reached
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had formed certain
little resolutions on this subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) should kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
pleased, once again when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) went,--and only once. And now, almost
without a motion on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) part that was perceptible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took herself
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) arms. There should be no word about that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could help
it,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was bound to remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) now but
a distant cousin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) must cease to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lover, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). Nay,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had so ceased already. There must be no more laying of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) shoulder, no more twisting of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fingers through
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) locks, no more looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) eyes, no more amorous pressing
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips against his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own. Much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must remember
now that such outward signs of love as these would not befit her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to see you! And yet I do not know
but what it would have been better that you should have stayed away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should it have been better? It would have been unnatural not to
have met each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I thought. Why should not friends endure to say good-bye, even
though their friendship be as dear as ours? I told Aunt Sarah that
I should be angry with myself afterwards if I feared to tell you to
come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing to fear,--only that it is so wretched an ending,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In one way I will not look on it as an ending. You and I cannot be
married, Walter; but I shall always have your career to look to, and
shall think of you as my dearest friend. I shall expect you to write
to me;--not at first, but after a year or so. You will be able to
write to me then as though you were my brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never be able to do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes;--that is, if you will make the effort for my sake. I do not
believe but what people can manage and mould their own wills if they
will struggle hard enough. You must not be unhappy, Walter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not so wise or self-confident as you, Mary. I shall be unhappy.
I should be deceiving myself if I were to tell myself otherwise.
There is nothing before me to make me happy. When I came home there
was very little that I cared for, though I had the prospect of this
money and thought that my cares in that respect were over. Then I
met you, and the whole world seemed altered. I was happy even when
I found how badly I had been treated. Now all that has gone, and I
cannot think that I shall be happy again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to be happy, Walter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you may, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are gradations in happiness. The highest I ever came to yet
was when you told me that you loved me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
attempted to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) withdrew from him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), almost without
a sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was doing so. <div class="bookquote">``I have not quite lost that yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``and I do not mean to lose it altogether. I shall always
remember that you loved me; and you will not forget that I too loved
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forget it?--no, I don't exactly think that I shall forget it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why it should make us altogether unhappy. For a time, I
suppose, we shall be down-hearted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall, I know. I can't pretend to such strength as to say that I
can lose what I want, and not feel it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall both feel it, Walter;--but I do not know that we must be
miserable. When do you leave England?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing is settled. I have not had the heart to think of it. It will
not be for a month or two yet. I suppose I shall stay out my regular
Indian time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what shall you do with yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no plans at all, Mary. Sir Gregory has asked me to Dunripple,
and I shall remain there probably till I am tired of it. It will be
so pleasant, talking to my uncle of my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not talk of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at all, Walter. You will best forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) by not
talking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). We shall hear, I suppose, of what you do from Parson
John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seated herself a little away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did not attempt
to draw near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) again till at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bidding he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) rose to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) sat there for nearly an hour, and during that time much more was
said by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) than by him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) endeavoured to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) understand that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was as free as air, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would hope some day to hear that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was married. In reply to this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) asserted very loudly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
would never call any woman his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wife, unless unexpected circumstances
should enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) to return and again ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Not that you
are to wait for me, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) smiled, but made no definite
answer to this. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had told herself that it would not be for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
welfare that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should allude to the possibility of a renewed
engagement, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not allude to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said at last, coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) and offering
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, for ever and ever, dearest Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) arms and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again and again. It was to be the last,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not seem to shun him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), went as far as
the door,--and returned again. <div class="bookquote">``Dearest, dearest Mary. You will give
me one more kiss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be the last, Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>),
as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother that was going from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and
escaping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) arms she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) left the room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had come to Loring late on the previous evening, and on that same
day he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) returned to London. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) dined at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) club, drank a
pint of wine and smoked a cigar or two, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did it all after a
lugubrious fashion. Men knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had fallen into great trouble in
the matter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) inheritance, and did not expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) to be joyful
and of pleasant countenance. <div class="bookquote">``By George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said little Captain Boodle,
<div class="bookquote">``if it was my governor, I'd go very near being hung for him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>); I would,
by George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Which remark obtained a good deal of general sympathy in
the billiard-room of that military club. In the meantime Mary Lowther
at Loring had resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would not be lugubrious, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) sat
down to dinner opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) aunt with a pleasant smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
face. Before the evening was over, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had in some degree
broken down. <div class="bookquote">``I fear I can't get along with novels, Aunt Sarah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think I could find something to do.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Then the old
lady came round the room and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) niece;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) made no other
reply.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV.

<p/>BULLHAMPTON NEWS.


<p/>When the matter was quite settled at Loring,--when Miss Marrable not
only knew that the engagement had been surrendered on both sides, but
that it had been so surrendered as to be incapable of being again
patched up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) bethought herself of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) promise to Mr. Gilmore.
This did not take place for a fortnight after the farewell which
was spoken in the last chapter,--at which time Walter Marrable was
staying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle, Sir Gregory, at Dunripple. Miss Marrable
had undertaken that Mr. Gilmore should be informed as soon as the
engagement was brought to an end, and had been told that this
information should reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) through Mrs. Fenwick. When a fortnight
had passed, Miss Marrable was aware that Mary had not herself written
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend at Bullhampton; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt herself to be shy
of the subject, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) entertained a repugnance to make any
communication based on a hope that Mary might after a while receive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) old lover graciously,--for time must of course be needed before
such grace could be accorded,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did write a few lines to Mrs.
Fenwick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) explained that Captain Marrable was to return to India,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was to go as a free man. Mary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) burden
well. Of course, it must be some time before the remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
cousin would cease to be a burden to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
heavy task with a good will,--so said Miss Marrable,--and would no
doubt conquer her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own unhappiness after a time by the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
personal character. Not a word was spoken of Mr. Gilmore, but Mrs.
Fenwick understood it all. The letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew well, was a message
to Mr. Gilmore;--a message which it would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) duty to give as soon
as possible, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) might extract from it such comfort as it would
contain for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>),--though it would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) duty not to act upon it for,
at any rate, many months to come. <div class="bookquote">``And it will be a comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) read Miss Marrable's letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of all the men I know, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) is the most constant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick,
<div class="bookquote">``and best deserves that his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) constancy should be rewarded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the man's nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) will get
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) at last; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) has got her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) will be quite contented with
the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) has won her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>). There's nothing like going on
with a thing. I believe I might be a bishop if I set my heart on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that the beauty of the thing is so well-defined to me
as is Mary Lowther's to poor Harry. In perseverance and success of
that kind the man's mind should admit of no doubt. Harry is quite
clear of this,--that in spite of Mary's preference for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin, it
would be the grandest thing in the world to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). The certainty of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) condition will pull him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) through at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/>Two days after this Mrs. Fenwick put Miss Marrable's letter into Mr.
Gilmore's hand,--having perceived that it was specially written that
it might be so treated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) kept it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) pocket till she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) should
chance to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and at last handed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
walking on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own grounds. <div class="bookquote">``I have a letter from Loring,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--from Mary's aunt. I have it here, and I think you had better
read it. To tell you the truth, Harry, I have been looking for you
ever since I got it. Only you must not make too much of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) read the letter. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``by making too
much of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not suppose that Mary is the same as before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw this
cousin of hers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--yes, in body and in soul, no doubt. But such an experience
leaves a mark which cannot be rubbed out quite at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that I must wait before I ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) again.''

know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will wait; but as for the rubbing out of the mark, I take it that
will be altogether beyond me. Do you think, Mrs. Fenwick, that no
woman should ever, under any circumstances, marry one man when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
loves another?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could not bring herself to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) opinion Mary
Lowther would of all women be the least likely to do so. <div class="bookquote">``That is one
of those questions,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``which it is almost impossible for a

have a clear definition of love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what I mean well enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do know what you mean, but I hardly do know how to answer you. If
you went to Mary Lowther now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would take it almost as an insult;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would feel it in that light, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is aware that you
know of this story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall not go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such things cannot be forgotten,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, <div class="bookquote">``it is probable that Mary will be

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never be cured of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), laughing. <div class="bookquote">``As for Mary,
I hardly know what to think. I suppose girls do marry without caring
very much for the men they take. One sees it every day; and then
afterwards, they love their husbands. It isn't very romantic, but it
seems to me that it is so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think of it too much, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick. <div class="bookquote">``If you still

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then wait awhile, and we will have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at Bullhampton again. You
know at any rate what our wishes are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Everything had been very quiet at Bullhampton during the last three
months. The mill was again in regular work, and Sam had remained at
home with fair average regularity. The Vicar had heard nothing more
of Carry Brattle, and had been unable to trace her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) or to learn where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was living. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had taken various occasions to mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) name to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) mother, but Mrs. Brattle knew nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), and believed that
Sam was equally ignorant with herself. Both she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) and the Vicar found
it impossible to speak to Sam on the subject, though they knew that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had been with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sister more than once when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was living at
Pycroft Common. As for the miller himself, no one had mentioned
Carry's name to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) since the day on which the Vicar had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
attempt. And from that day to the present there had been, if not ill
blood, at least cold blood between Mr. Fenwick and old Brattle. The
Vicar had gone down to the mill as often as usual, having determined
that what had occurred should make no difference with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>); and the
intercourse with Mrs. Brattle and Fanny had been as kind on each side
as usual;--but the miller had kept out of his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) way, retreating from
him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) openly, going from the house to the mill as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) appeared,
never speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>), and taking no other notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) beyond a
slight touch of the hat. <div class="bookquote">``Your husband is still angry with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
said one day to Mrs. Brattle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) head and smiled sadly,
and said that it would pass over some day,--only that Jacob was so
persistent. With Sam, the Vicar held little or no communication.
Sam in these days never went to church, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) worked at the
mill pretty constantly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would absent himself from the village
occasionally for a day or two together, and tell no one where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had
been.

<p/>The strangest and most important piece of business going on at
this time in Bullhampton was the building of a new chapel or
tabernacle,--the people called it a Salem,--for Mr. Puddleham. The
first word as to the erection reached Mr. Fenwick's ears from Grimes,
the builder and carpenter, who, meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) in Bullhampton Street,
pointed out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) a bit of spare ground just opposite the vicarage
gates,--a morsel of a green on which no building had ever yet stood,
and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) that the Marquis had given it for a chapel. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Fenwick. <div class="bookquote">``I hope it may be convenient and large enough for them.
All the same, I wish it had been a little farther from my gate.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said in a cheery tone, showing thereby considerable presence of
mind. That such a building should be so placed was a trial to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew at once that the spot must have been selected to annoy
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). Doubtless, the land in question was the property of the Marquis
of Trowbridge. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) came to think of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had no doubt on
the matter. Nevertheless, the small semi-circular piece of grass
immediately opposite to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own swinging gate, looked to all the
world as though it were an appendage of the Vicarage. A cottage
built there would have been offensive; but a staring brick Methodist
chapel, with the word Salem inserted in large letters over the door,
would, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was aware, flout him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) left or entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had always been specially careful to avoid any semblance
of a quarrel with the Methodist minister, and had in every way shown
his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) willingness to regard Mr. Puddleham's flock as being equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>)
own in the general gifts of civilisation. To Mr. Puddleham himself,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) had been very civil, sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) fruit and vegetables out of
the Vicarage garden, and lending him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) newspapers. When the little
Puddlehams were born, Mrs. Fenwick always inquired after the mother
and infant. The greatest possible care had been exercised at the
Vicarage since Mr. Fenwick's coming to show that the Established
Church did not despise the dissenting congregation. For the last
three years there had been talk of a new chapel, and Mr. Fenwick had
himself discussed the site with Mr. Puddleham. A large and commodious
spot of ground, remote from the vicarage, had, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) believed, been
chosen. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) heard those tidings, and saw what would be the effect
of the building, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) almost impossible that a Marquis
could condescend to such revenge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) went at once to Mr. Puddleham,
and learned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) that Grimes' story was true. This had been in
December. After Christmas, the foundations were to be begun at once,
said Mr. Puddleham, so that the brickwork might go on as soon as the
frosts were over. Mr. Puddleham was in high spirits, and expressed a
hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) should be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) new chapel by next August. When the
Vicar asked why the change of site was made, being careful to show
no chagrin by the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) voice, Mr. Puddleham remarked that
the Marquis's agent thought that it would be an improvement, <div class="bookquote">``in
which opinion I quite coincide,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis agent</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Puddleham, looking very
stern,--showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) teeth, as it were, and displaying an inclination
for a parish quarrel. Fenwick, still prudent, made no objection to
the change, and dropped no word of displeasure in Mr. Puddleham's
hearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) can do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, boiling with
passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) can, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say the street is his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>);--to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) likes with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The street is the Queen's highway,--which means that it belongs to
the public; but this is not the street. I take it that all the land
in the village belongs to the Marquis. I never knew of any common
right, and I don't believe there is any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the meanest thing I ever heard of in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There I agree with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Later in the day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been thinking
of it for hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) again spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``I shall write to the
Marquis and remonstrate. It will probably be of no avail; but I think
I ought to do so for the sake of those who come after me. I shall be
able to bother him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) a good deal, if I can do nothing else,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) added,
laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I feel, too, that I must quarrel with somebody, and I
won't quarrel with dear old Puddleham, if I can help it.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXV.

<p/>MR. PUDDLEHAM``S NEW CHAPEL.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration-RSB-

<p/>The Vicar devoted a week to the consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) grievance about
the chapel, and then did write to the Marquis. Indeed, there was no
time to be lost if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) intended to do anything, as on the second day
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) interview with Mr. Grimes, Grimes himself, with two men to
assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>), began their measuring on the devoted spot, sticking in
little marks for the corners of the projected building, and turning
up a sod here and there. Mr. Grimes was a staunch Churchman; and
though in the way of business he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) was very glad to have the building
of a Methodist chapel,--or of a Pagan temple, if such might come in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) way,--yet, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) possibly might give some offence to
the great man's shadow in Bullhampton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) was willing to postpone
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) work for two or three days at the Vicar's request. <div class="bookquote">``Grimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>the
Vicar said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not quite sure that I like this.''


 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: Site of Mr. Puddleham's new chapel.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir;--no, sir. I was thinking myself, sir, that maybe you
might take it unkind in the Marquis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>). Perhaps you wouldn't mind giving over
for a day or two.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>Grimes yielded at once, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) spade and
measurements away, although Mr. Puddleham fretted a good deal. Mr.
Puddleham had been much elated by the prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) new Bethel, and
had, it must be confessed, received into his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) mind an idea that it
would be a good thing to quarrel with the Vicar under the auspices of
the landlord. Fenwick's character had hitherto been too strong for
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had been forced into parochial quiescence and religious
amity almost in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) conscience. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was a much older man than
Mr. Fenwick, having been for thirty years in the ministry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had
always previously enjoyed the privilege of being on bad terms with
the clergyman of the Establishment. It had been his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) glory to be a
poacher on another man's manor, to filch souls, as it were, out of
the keeping of a pastor of a higher grade than himself, to say severe
things of the short comings of an endowed clergyman, and to obtain
recognition of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) position by the activity of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) operations in the
guise of a blister. Our Vicar, understanding something of this, had,
with some malice towards the gentleman himself, determined to rob
Mr. Puddleham of his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) blistering powers. There is no doubt a certain
pleasure in poaching which does not belong to the licit following of
game; but a man can't poach if the right of shooting be accorded to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Mr. Puddleham had not been quite happy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) mind amidst the
ease and amiable relations which Mr. Fenwick enforced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), and
had long since begun to feel that a few cabbages and peaches did not
repay him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) for the loss of those pleasant and bitter things, which it
would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to say in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) daily walks and from the pulpit of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) Salem, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) not been thus hampered, confined, and dominated.
Hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had hardly gained a single soul from under Mr. Fenwick's
grasp,--had indeed on the balance lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) grasp on souls, and was
beginning to be aware that this was so because of the cabbages and
the peaches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) told himself that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had not hankered after
these flesh-pots, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would have preferred to be without
the flesh-pots, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had submitted to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was painfully conscious
of the guile of this young man, who had, as it were, cheated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out
of that appropriate acerbity of religion, without which a proselyting
sect can hardly maintain its ground beneath the shadow of an endowed
and domineering Church. War was necessary to Mr. Puddleham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) had
come to be hardly anybody at all, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) was at peace with the
vicar of the parish in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) was established. His (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) eyes had been
becoming gradually open to all this for years; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) had been
present at the bitter quarrel between the Vicar and the Marquis,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had at once told himself that now was his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) opportunity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had
intended to express a clear opinion to Mr. Fenwick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), Mr.
Fenwick, had been very wrong in speaking to the Marquis as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had
spoken, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was walking out of the farm-house he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was preparing
some words as to the respect due to those in authority. It happened,
however, that at that moment the wind was taken out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) sails by
a strange comparison which the Vicar made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) between the sins
of them two, ministers of God as they were, and the sins of Carry
Brattle. Mr. Puddleham at the moment had been cowed and quelled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
was not quite able to carry himself in the Vicar's presence as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) were the Vicar's equal. But the desire for a quarrel remained,
and when it was suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) by Mr. Packer, the Marquis's man of
business, that the green opposite to the Vicarage gate would be a
convenient site for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) chapel, and that the Marquis was ready to
double his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) before-proffered subscription, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) saw plainly that
the moment had come, and that it was fitting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) should gird up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) loins and return all future cabbages to the proud donor.

<p/>Mr. Puddleham had his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) eye keenly set on the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) future
ministration, and was aware of Grimes's default almost as soon as
that man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) myrmidons had left the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once went to
Grimes with heavy denunciations, with threats of the Marquis, and
with urgent explanation as to the necessity of instant work. But
Grimes was obdurate. The Vicar had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) to leave the work for
a day or two, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) must do what the Vicar asked. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) couldn't be allowed to do as much as that for the Vicar of the
parish, Bullhampton wouldn't be, in Mr. Grimes's opinion, any place
for anybody to live in. Mr. Puddleham argued the matter out, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
argued in vain. Mr. Grimes declared that there was time enough, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) would have the work finished by the time fixed,--unless,
indeed, the Marquis should change his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) mind. Mr. Puddleham regarded
this as a most improbable supposition. <div class="bookquote">``The Marquis doesn't change
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) mind, Mr. Grimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) said; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) walked forth from Mr.
Grimes's house with much offence.

<p/>By this time all Bullhampton knew of the quarrel,--knew of it,
although Mr. Fenwick had been so very careful to guard himself from
any quarrelling at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had not spoken a word in anger on the
subject to anyone but his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife; and in making his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) request to Grimes
had done so with hypocritical good humour. But, nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) was
aware that the parish was becoming hot about it; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) sat down
to write his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) letter to the Marquis he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was almost minded to give up
the idea of writing, to return to Grimes, and to allow the measuring
and sod-turning to be continued. Why should a place of worship
opposite to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) gate be considered by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) as an injury? Why should
the psalm-singing of Christian brethren hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) ears as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) walked
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) garden? And if, through the infirmity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) nature, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) ears were hurt, what was that to the great purport for
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had been sent into the parish? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) not about to create
enmity by his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) opposition; and was it not his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) special duty to foster
love and goodwill among his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) people? After all he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), within his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own
Vicarage grounds, had all that it was intended that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) should
possess; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) held very firmly. Poor Mr. Puddleham had no such
firm holding; and why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) quarrel with Mr. Puddleham because
that ill-paid preacher sought to strengthen the ground on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
Salem stood?

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) paused, however, to think of all this, there came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) the
conviction that in this thing that was to be done the Marquis was
determined to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) personally, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could not resist the
temptation of fighting the Marquis. And then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) succumbed easily
in this matter, would it not follow almost as a matter of course that
the battle against him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would be carried on elsewhere? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) yielded
now, resolving to ignore altogether any idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own comfort or
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own taste, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) thereby maintain that tranquillity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
parish which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) thought so desirable? He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had already seen that in Mr.
Puddleham's manner to himself which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) sure that Mr. Puddleham
was ambitious to be a sword in the right hand of the Marquis.
Personally the Vicar was himself pugnacious. Few men, perhaps, were
more so. If there must be a fight let them come on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would do
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) best. Turning the matter thus backwards and forwards in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) mind,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) came at last to the conclusion that there must be a fight, and
consequently he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wrote the following letter to the Marquis;--


<p/>Bullhampton Vicarage, January 3, 186--.

<p/>MY LORD MARQUIS,

<p/>I learned by chance the other day in the village that
a new chapel for the use of the Methodist congregation
of the parish was to be built on the little open green
immediately opposite the Vicarage gate, and that this
special spot of ground had been selected and given by
your lordship for this purpose. I do not at all know what
truth there may be in this,--except that Mr. Grimes, the
carpenter here, has received orders from your agent about
the work. It may probably be the case that the site has
been chosen by Mr. Packer, and not by your lordship. As no
real delay to the building can at this time of the year
arise from a short postponement of the beginning, I have
asked Mr. Grimes to desist till I shall have written to
you on the subject.

<p/>I can assure your lordship, in the first place, that no
clergyman of the Established Church in the kingdom can be
less unwilling than I am that they who dissent from my
teaching in the parish should have a commodious place of
worship. If land belonged to me in the place I would give
it myself for such a purpose; and were there no other
available site than that chosen, I would not for a moment
remonstrate against it. I had heard, with satisfaction,
from Mr. Puddleham himself that another spot was chosen
near the cross roads in the village, on which there is
more space, to which as I believe there is no objection,
and which would certainly be nearer than that now selected
to the majority of the congregation.

<p/>But of course it would not be for me to trouble your
lordship as to the ground on which a Methodist chapel
should be built, unless I had reason to show why the
site now chosen is objectionable. I do not for a moment
question your lordship's right to give the site. There is
something less than a quarter of an acre in the patch in
question; and though hitherto I have always regarded it
as belonging in some sort to the Vicarage,--as being a
part, as it were, of the entrance,--I feel convinced that
you, as landlord of the ground, would not entertain the
idea of bestowing it for any purpose without being sure
of your right to do so. I raise no question on this
point, believing that there is none to be raised; but I
respectfully submit to your lordship, whether such an
erection as that contemplated by you will not be a lasting
injury to the Vicarage of Bullhampton, and whether you
would wish to inflict a lasting and gratuitous injury
on the vicar of a parish, the greatest portion of which
belongs to yourself.

<p/>No doubt life will be very possible to me and my wife, and
to succeeding vicars and their wives, with a red-brick
chapel built as a kind of watch-tower over the Vicarage
gate. So would life be possible at Turnover Park with
a similar edifice immediately before your lordship's
hall-door. Knowing very well that the reasonable wants of
the Methodists cannot make such a building on such a spot
necessary, you no doubt would not consent to it; and I now
venture to ask you to put a stop to this building here for
the same reason. Were there no other site in the parish
equally commodious I would not say a word.

<p/>I have the honour to be,
Your lordship's most obedient servant,

<p/>FRANCIS FENWICK.


<p/>Lord Trowbridge, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) received this letter,--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) had only
partially read it, and had not at all digested it, was disposed to
yield the point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) was a silly man, thinking much too highly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
own position, believing himself entitled to unlimited deference from
all those who in any way came within the rays of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) magnificence,
and easily made angry by opposition; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) was not naturally prone
to inflict evil, and did in some degree recognise it as a duty
attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) splendour that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) should be beneficent to the
inferiors with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) was connected. Great as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) wrath against
the present Vicar of Bullhampton, and thoroughly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) conceived it
to be expedient that so evil-minded a pastor should be driven out of
the parish, nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) felt some scruple at taking a step which
would be injurious to the parish vicar, let the parish vicar be who
he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) might. Packer was the sinner who had originated the new plan for
punishing Mr. Fenwick,--Packer, with the assistance of Mr. Puddleham;
and the Marquis, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had in some sort authorised the plan, had
in truth thought very little about it. When the Vicar spoke of the
lasting injury to the Vicarage, and when Lord Trowbridge remembered
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) owned two thousand and two acres within the parish,--as Mr.
Puddleham had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>),--he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) began to think that the chapel had better
be built elsewhere. The Vicar was a pestilent man to whom punishment
was due, but the punishment should be made to attach itself to the
man, rather than to the man's office. So was working the Marquis's
mind, till the Marquis came upon that horrid passage in the Vicar's
letter, in which it was suggested that the building of a Methodist
chapel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own park, immediately in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own august
hall-door might under certain circumstances be expedient. The remark
was almost as pernicious and unpardonable as that which had been
made about his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) lordship's daughters. It was manifest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) that the
Vicar intended to declare that marquises were no more than other
people,--and that the declaration was made and insisted on with the
determination of insulting him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). Had this apostate priest been capable
of feeling any proper appreciation of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) own position and that
of the Marquis, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would have said nothing of Turnover Park. When
the Marquis had read the letter a second time and had digested it
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) perceived that its whole tenour was bad, that the writer was
evil-minded, and that no request made by him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) should be granted. Even
though the obnoxious chapel should have to be pulled down for the
benefit of another vicar, it should be put up for the punishment of
this vicar. A man who wants to have a favour done for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), can hardly
hope to be successful if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks for the favour with insolence. So
the heart of the Marquis was hardened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was strengthened to do
that which misbecame him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) both as a gentleman and a landlord.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did not answer the letter for some time; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) saw Packer, saw
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) head agent, and got out the map of the property. The map of
the property was not very clear in the matter, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) remembered
the space well, and convinced himself that no other place in all
Bullhampton could be so appropriate for a Methodist chapel. At the
end of a week he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) caused a reply to be written to Mr. Fenwick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
would not demean himself by writing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own hand, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) gave
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) orders to the head agent. The head agent merely informed the
Vicar that it was considered that the spot of ground in question was
the most appropriate in the village for the purpose in hand.

<p/>Mrs. Fenwick when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) heard the reply burst out into tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was a
woman by no means over devoted to things of this world, who thought
much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) duties and did them, who would have sacrificed anything
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband and children, who had learned the fact that both
little troubles and great, if borne with patience, may be borne with
ease; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did think much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) house, was proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) garden,
and rejoiced in the external prettiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) surroundings. It was
gall to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that this hideous building should be so placed as to
destroy the comeliness of that side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) abode. <div class="bookquote">``We shall hear
their singing and ranting whenever we open our front windows,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we won't open them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't help ourselves. Just see what it will be whenever we go in
and out. We might just as well have it inside the house at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak as though Mr. Puddleham were always in his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) pulpit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're always doing something,--and then the building will be there
whether it's open or shut. It will alter the parish altogether, and I
really think it will be better that you should get an exchange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And run away from my enemy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be running away from an intolerable nuisance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``If there were no other reason for
staying, I won't put it in the power of the Marquis of Trowbridge
to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) has turned me out of my parish, and so punished me
because I have not submitted myself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>). I have not sought the
quarrel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) has been overbearing and insolent, and now is meanly
desirous to injure me because I will not suffer his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) insolence. No
doubt, placed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) can do much; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) cannot turn me out of
Bullhampton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the good of staying, Frank, if we are to be made wretched?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We won't be made wretched. What! be wretched because there is an
ugly building opposite to your outside gate? It is almost wicked to
say so. I don't like it. I like the doing of the thing less even than
the thing itself. If it can be stopped, I will stop it. If it could
be prevented by any amount of fighting, I should think myself right
to fight in such a cause. If I can see my way to doing anything to
oppose the Marquis, it shall be done. But I won't run away.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Fenwick said nothing more on the subject at that moment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) felt
that the glory and joy of the Vicarage were gone from it.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI.

<p/>SAM BRATTLE GOES OFF AGAIN.


<p/>Mr. Grimes had suggested to the Vicar in a very low whisper that the
new chapel might perhaps be put down as a nuisance. <div class="bookquote">``It ain't for me
to say, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimes, <div class="bookquote">``and in the way of business one
building is as good as another as long as you see your money. But
buildings is stopped because they're nuisances.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>This occurred a day
or two after the receipt of the agent's letter from Turnover, and the
communication was occasioned by orders given to Mr. Grimes to go on
with the building instantly, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) intended to withdraw from the
job. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think, Grimes, that I can call a place of Christian
worship a nuisance,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. To this Grimes rejoined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>)
had known a nunnery bell to be stopped because it was a nuisance, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) didn't see why a Methodist chapel bell was not as bad as a
nunnery bell. Fenwick had declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would fight if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could
find a leg to stand upon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thanked Grimes, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) would
think of the suggestion. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) thought of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) did not see
that any remedy was open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) on that side. In the meantime Mr.
Puddleham attacked Grimes with great severity because the work was
not continued. Mr. Puddleham, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) had the Marquis at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) back, was eager for the fight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) had already received in the
street a salutation from the Vicar, cordial as usual, with the
very slightest bend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) neck, and the sourest expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
mouth. Mrs. Puddleham had already taught the little Puddlehams that
the Vicarage cabbages were bitter with the wormwood of an endowed
Establishment, and ought no longer to be eaten by the free children
of an open Church. Mr. Puddleham had already raised up his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) voice in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) existing tabernacle, as to the injury which was being done to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) flock, and had been very touching on the subject of the little
vineyard which the wicked king coveted. When he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) described himself as
Naboth, it could not but be supposed that Ahab and Jezebel were both
in Bullhampton. It went forth through the village that Mr. Puddleham
had described Mrs. Fenwick as Jezebel, and the torch of discord had
been thrown down, and war was raging through the parish.

<p/>There had come to be very high words indeed between Mr. Grimes and
Mr. Puddleham, and some went so far as to declare that they had heard
the builder threaten to punch the minister's head. This Mr. Grimes
denied stoutly, as the Methodist party were making much of it in
consequence of Mr. Puddleham's cloth and advanced years. <div class="bookquote">``There's no
lies is too hot for them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimes, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) energy, and <div class="bookquote">``no
lawlessness too heavy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimes/Grimes</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) absolutely refused to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) hand to
a spade or a trowel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) time named in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) contract, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) said,
and nobody had a right to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>). This was ended by the appearance
on a certain Monday morning of a Baptist builder from Salisbury, with
all the appurtenances of his (<font color='blue'><b>builder</b></font>) trade, and with a declaration on Mr.
Grimes' part, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) would have the law on the two leading members
of the Puddleham congregation, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) had received his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) original
order. In truth, however, there had been no contract, and Mr.
Grimes had gone to work upon a verbal order which, according to the
Puddleham theory, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) had already vitiated by refusing compliance with
its terms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>), however, was hot upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) lawsuit, and thus the whole
parish was by the ears.

<p/>It may be easily understood how much Mr. Fenwick would suffer from
all this. It had been specially his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) pride that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) parish had been at
peace, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had plumed himself on the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had continued
to clip the claws with which nature had provided the Methodist
minister. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) was fond of a fight himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) had taught
himself to know that in no way could he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) do the business of his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>)
life more highly or more usefully than as a peacemaker; and as a
peacemaker he (<font color='blue'><b>peacemaker</b></font>) had done it. He (<font color='blue'><b>peacemaker</b></font>) had never put his (<font color='blue'><b>peacemaker</b></font>) hand within Mr.
Puddleham's arm, and whispered a little parochial nothing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
neighbour's ear, without taking some credit to himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
cleverness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) had called his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) peaches angels of peace, and had spoken
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) cabbages as being dove-winged. All this was now over, and
there was hardly one in Bullhampton who was not busy hating and
abusing somebody else.

<p/>And then there came another trouble on the Vicar. Just at the end of
January, Sam Brattle came up to the Vicarage and told Mr. Fenwick
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was going to leave the mill. Sam was dressed very decently;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was attired in an un-Bullhampton fashion, which was not
pleasant to Mr. Fenwick's eyes; and there was about him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) an air which
seemed to tell of filial disobedience and personal independence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you mean to come back again, Sam?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir; I don't know as I do. Father and I has had words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that is to be a reason why you should leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)? You speak of
your father as though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were no more to you than another man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't a' borne not a tenth of it from no other man, Mr.
Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--and what of that? Is there any measure of what is due by you
to your father? Remember, Sam, I know your father well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) is a very just man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) is very fond of you. You are the apple
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) eye, and now you would bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) gray hairs with sorrow to the
grave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ask mother, sir, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll tell you how it is. I just said a
word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>),--a word as was right to be said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) turned upon me,
and bade me go away and come back no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) has banished you from the mill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said what I tells you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) told mother afterwards, that if so as I
would promise never to mention that thing again, I might come and go
as I pleased. But I wasn't going to make no such promise. I up and
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) so; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)--cursed me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment or two the Vicar was silent, thinking whether in this
affair Sam had been most wrong, or the old man. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was
hearing but one side of the question. <div class="bookquote">``What was it, Sam, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
forbade you to mention?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It don't matter now, sir; only I thought I'd better come and tell
you, along of your being the bail, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that you are going to leave Bullhampton altogether?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To leave it altogether, Mr. Fenwick. I ain't doing no good here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why shouldn't you do good? Where can you do more good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't be good to be having words with father day after day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Sam, I don't think you can go away. You are bound by the
magistrates' orders. I don't speak for myself, but I fear the police
would be after you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is it to go on allays,--that a chap can't move to better
hisself, because them fellows can't catch the men as murdered old
Trumbull? That can't be law,--nor yet justice.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>Upon this there arose
a discussion in which the Vicar endeavoured to explain to the young
man that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had evidently consorted with the men who were, on the
strongest possible grounds, suspected to be the murderers, and as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had certainly been with those men where he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had no business to
be,--namely, in Mr. Fenwick's own garden at night,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had no just
cause of complaint at finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own liberty more crippled than that
of other people. No doubt Sam understood this well enough, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was
sharp and intelligent; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) fought his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own battle, declaring that
as the Vicar had not prosecuted him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) for being in the garden, nobody
could be entitled to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) for that offence; and that as it had
been admitted that there was no evidence connecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) with the
murder, no policeman could have a right to confine him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) to one parish.
He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) argued the matter so well, that Mr. Fenwick was left without much
to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was unwilling to press his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own responsibility in the
matter of the bail, and therefore allowed the question to fall
through,--tacitly admitting that if Sam chose to leave the parish,
there was nothing in the affair of the murder to hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) went
back, therefore, to the inexpediency of the young man's departure,
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would rush right into the Devil's jaws. <div class="bookquote">``May be
so, Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Sam, <div class="bookquote">``but I'm sure I'll never be out of 'em as
long as I stays here in Bullhampton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is it all about, Sam?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div>The Vicar, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) asked the question
had a very distinct idea in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own head as to the cause of the
quarrel, and was aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) sympathies were with the son rather
than with the father. Sam answered never a word, and the Vicar
repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) question. <div class="bookquote">``You have quarrelled with your father before
this, and have made it up. Why should not you make up this quarrel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) cursed me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Sam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An idle word, spoken in wrath! Don't you know your father well
enough to take that for what it is worth? What was it about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was about Carry, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What had you said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said as how she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ought to be let come home again, and that if I was
to stay there at the mill, I'd fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) struck at me with
one of the mill-bolts. But I didn't think much o' that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--cursed you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; mother came up, and I went aside with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as I'd go
on speaking to the old man about Carry;--and so I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where is Carry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>Sam made no reply to this whatever. <div class="bookquote">``You know
where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can be found, Sam?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>Sam shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) head, but didn't speak.
<div class="bookquote">``You couldn't have said that you would fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), if you didn't know

doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div><p/>So they parted, as friends rather than as enemies, though the Vicar
knew very well that the young man was wrong to go and leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
father and mother, and that in all probability he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would fall at
once into some bad mode of living. But the conversation about Carry
Brattle had so softened their hearts to each other, that Mr. Fenwick
found it impossible to be severe. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew, moreover, that no
severity of expression would have been of avail. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) couldn't have
stopped Sam from going had he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) preached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) for an hour.

<p/>After that the building of the chapel went on apace, the large
tradesman from Salisbury being quicker in his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) work than could have
been the small tradesman belonging to Bullhampton. In February there
came a hard frost, and still the bricklayers were at work. It was
said in Bullhampton that walls built as those walls were being built
could never stand. But then it might be that these reports were
spread by Mr. Grimes, that the fanatical ardour of the Salisbury
Baptist lent something to the rapidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) operations, and that
the Bullhampton feeling in favour of Mr. Fenwick and the Church
Establishment added something to the bitterness of the prevailing
criticisms. At any rate, the walls of the new chapel were mounting
higher and higher all through February, and by the end of the first
week in March there stood immediately opposite to the Vicarage gate a
hideously ugly building, roofless, doorless, windowless;--with those
horrid words,--<div class="bookquote">``New Salem, 186--''  (<font color='red'><b>England parish clergyman</b></font>)</div>legibly inscribed on a visible
stone inserted above the doorway, a thing altogether as objectionable
to the eyes of a Church of England parish clergyman as the
imagination of any friend or enemy could devise. We all know the
abominable adjuncts of a new building,--the squalid half-used heaps
of bad mortar, the eradicated grass, the truculent mud, the scattered
brickbats, the remnants of timber, the debris of the workmen's
dinners, the morsels of paper scattered through the dirt! There had
from time to time been actual encroachments on the Vicarage grounds,
and Mrs. Fenwick, having discovered that the paint had been injured
on the Vicarage gate, had sent an angry message to the Salisbury
Baptist. The Salisbury Baptist had apologised to Mr. Fenwick, saying
that such things would happen in the building of houses, &c., and Mr.
Fenwick had assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that the matter was of no consequence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was
not going to descend into the arena with the Salisbury Baptist. In
this affair the Marquis of Trowbridge was his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) enemy, and with the
Marquis he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would fight, if there was to be any fight at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would
stand at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) gate and watch the work, and speak good-naturedly to
the workmen; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was in truth sick at heart. The thing, horrible
as it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), so fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could not keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) mind
from it. During all this time it made his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) wife miserable. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
literally grown thin under the infliction of the new chapel. For more
than a fortnight she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had refused to visit the front gate of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own
house. To and from church she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) always went by the garden wicket; but
in going to the school, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had to make a long round to avoid the
chapel,--and this round she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) made day after day. Fenwick himself,
still hoping that there might be some power of fighting, had written
to an enthusiastic archdeacon, a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), who lived not very
far distant. The Archdeacon had consulted the Bishop,--really
troubled deeply about the matter,--and the Bishop had taken upon
himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) own hands, to write words of mild remonstrance to
the Marquis. <div class="bookquote">``For the welfare of the parish generally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bishop/Lord Bishop</b></font>)</div>said the
Bishop, <div class="bookquote">``I venture to make this suggestion to your lordship, feeling
sure that you will do anything that may not be unreasonable to
promote the comfort of the parishioners.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bishop/Lord Bishop</b></font>)</div>In this letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) made no
allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) late correspondence with the Marquis as to the sins
of the Vicar. Nor did the Marquis in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) reply allude to the former
correspondence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) expressed an opinion that the erection of a
place of Christian worship on an open space outside the bounds of a
clergyman's domain ought not to be held to be objectionable by that
clergyman;--and that as he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had already given the spot, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) could not
retract the gift. These letters, however, had been written before the
first brick had been laid, and the world in that part of the country
was of opinion that the Marquis might have retracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) gift. After
this Mr. Fenwick found no ground whatever on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could fight his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
battle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could only stand at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) gateway, and look at the thing as
it rose above the ground, fascinated by its ugliness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was standing there once, about a month or five weeks after his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
interview with Sam Brattle, just at the beginning of March, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
was accosted by the Squire. Mr. Gilmore, through the winter,--ever
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had heard that Mary Lowther's engagement with Walter
Marrable had been broken off,--had lived very much alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had been
pressed to come to the Vicarage, but had come but seldom, waiting
patiently till the time should come when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) might again ask Mary to
be his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was not so gloomy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had been during the time the
engagement had lasted, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was a man much altered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
former self. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) came across the road, and spoke a word or two to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``If I were you, Frank, I should not think so much about
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you would, old boy, if it touched you as it does me. It isn't
that the chapel should be there. I could have built a chapel for them
with my own hands on the same spot, if it had been necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see what there is to annoy you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This annoys me,--that after all my endeavours, there should be
people here, and many people, who find a gratification in doing that
which they think I shall look upon as an annoyance. The sting is
in their desire to sting, and in my inability to show them their
error, either by stopping what they are doing, or by proving myself
indifferent to it. It isn't the building itself, but the double
disgrace of the building.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXVII.

<p/>FEMALE MARTYRDOM.


<p/>Early in February Captain Marrable went to Dunripple to stay with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle, Sir Gregory, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) still was when the middle of
March had come. News of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) doings reached the ladies at Loring, but
it reached them through hands which were not held to be worthy of a
perfect belief,--at any rate, on Mary Lowther's part. Dunripple Park
is in Warwickshire, and lies in the middle of a good hunting country.
Now, according to Parson John, from whom these tidings came, Walter
Marrable was hunting three days a week; and, as Sir Gregory himself
did not keep hunters, Walter must have hired his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) horses,--so said
Parson John, deploring that a nephew so poor in purse should have
allowed himself to be led into such heavy expense. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) brought home
a little ready money with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson; <div class="bookquote">``and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) may have his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fling as long as that lasts.''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>No doubt Parson
John, in saying this, was desirous of proving to Mary that Walter
Marrable was not dying of love, and was, upon the whole, leading a
jolly life, in spite of the little misfortune that had happened to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). But Mary understood all this quite as well as did Parson John
himself; and simply declined to believe the hunting three days a
week. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said not a word about it, however, either to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) or to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
aunt. If Walter could amuse himself, so much the better; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
quite sure that, at such a period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) life as this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would not
spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) money recklessly. The truth lay between Parson John's
stories and poor Mary's belief. Walter Marrable was hunting,--perhaps
twice a week, hiring a horse occasionally, but generally mounted by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle, Sir Gregory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) hunted; but did so after a lugubrious
fashion, as became a man with a broken heart, who was laden with many
sorrows, and had just been separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lady love for ever and
ever. But still, when there came anything good, in the way of a run,
and when our Captain could get near to hounds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) enjoyed the fun,
and forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) troubles for a while. Is a man to know no joy because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has an ache at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) heart?

<p/>In this matter of disappointed and, as it were, disjointed affection,
men are very different from women, and for the most part, much more
happily circumstanced. Such sorrow a woman feeds;--but a man starves
it. Many will say that a woman feeds it, because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cannot but feed
it; and that a man starves it, because his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart is of the starving
kind. But, in truth, the difference comes not so much from the inner
heart, as from the outer life. It is easier to feed a sorrow upon
needle-and-thread and novels, than it is upon lawyers' papers, or
even the out-a-door occupations of a soldier home upon leave who has
no work to do. Walter Marrable told himself again and again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
was very unhappy about his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) cousin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) certainly did not suffer in
that matter as Mary suffered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had that other sorrow, arising from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) father's cruel usage of him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), to divide his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) thoughts, and probably
thought quite as much of the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had been robbed, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did of the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) love.

<p/>But poor Mary was, in truth, very wretched. When a girl asks herself
that question,--what shall she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) do with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life? it is so natural
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should answer it by saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will get married, and
give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life to somebody else. It is a woman's one career--let
women rebel against the edict as they may; and though there may
be word-rebellion here and there, women learn the truth early in
their lives. And women know it later in life when they think of
their girls; and men know it, too, when they have to deal with their
daughters. Girls, too, now acknowledge aloud that they have learned
the lesson; and Saturday Reviewers and others blame them for their
lack of modesty in doing so,--most unreasonably, most uselessly, and,
as far as the influence of such censors may go, most perniciously.
Nature prompts the desire, the world acknowledges its ubiquity,
circumstances show that it is reasonable, the whole theory of
creation requires it; but it is required that the person most
concerned should falsely repudiate it, in order that a mock modesty
may be maintained, in which no human being can believe! Such is the
theory of the censors who deal heavily with our Englishwomen of
the present day. Our daughters should be educated to be wives, but,
forsooth, they should never wish to be wooed! The very idea is but a
remnant of the tawdry sentimentality of an age in which the mawkish
insipidity of the women was the reaction from the vice of that
preceding it. That our girls are in quest of husbands, and know well
in what way their lines in life should be laid, is a fact which none
can dispute. Let men be taught to recognise the same truth as regards
themselves, and we shall cease to hear of the necessity of a new
career for women.

<p/>Mary Lowther, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had never encountered condemnation as a
husband-hunter, had learned all this, and was well aware that for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
there was but one future mode of life that could be really blessed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had eyes, and could see; and ears, and could hear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could
make,--indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could not fail to make,--comparisons between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) aunt and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) dear friend, Mrs. Fenwick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) saw, and could not
fail to see, that the life of the one was a starved, thin, poor
life,--which, good as it was in its nature, reached but to few
persons, and admitted but of few sympathies; whereas the other woman,
by means of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position as a wife and a mother, increased her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) roots
and spread out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) branches, so that there was shade, and fruit, and
beauty, and a place in which the birds might build their nests. Mary
Lowther had longed to be a wife,--as do all girls healthy in mind and
body; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had found it to be necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to love the man who
was to become her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) husband. There had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) a suitor recommended
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) by all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) friends,--recommended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) also by all outward
circumstances,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)! For a
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had been sorely perplexed, hardly knowing what it might
be her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) duty to do, not understanding how it was that the man was
indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), doubting whether, after all, the love of which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had dreamt was not a passion which might come after marriage,
rather than before it,--but still fearing to run so great a hazard.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had doubted, feared, and had hitherto declined,--when that other
lover had fallen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) way. Mr. Gilmore had wooed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) for months
without touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) heart. Then Walter Marrable had come and had
conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) almost in an hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had never felt herself disposed
to play with Mr. Gilmore's hair, to lean against his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) shoulder, to be
touched by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) fingers,--never disposed to wait for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) coming, or
to regret his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) going. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had hardly become acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
cousin before his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) presence was a pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>); and no sooner had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) love, than everything that concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was
dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>). The atmosphere that surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was sweeter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
than the air elsewhere. All those little aids which a man gives to a
woman were delightful to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) when they came to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had found the second half that was needed
to make herself one whole; that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had become round and entire in
joining herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) understood well why
it had been that Mr. Gilmore had been nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). As Mr. Fenwick
was manifestly the husband appointed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife, so had Walter
Marrable been appointed for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). And so there had come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a
dreamy conviction that marriages are made in heaven. That question,
whether they were to be poor or rich, to have enough or much less
than enough for the comforts of life, was, no doubt, one of much
importance; but, in the few happy days of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) assured engagement, it
was not allowed by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to interfere for a moment with the fact that
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and Walter were intended, each to be the companion of the other,
as long as they two might live.

<p/>Then by degrees,--by degrees, though the process had been quick,--had
fallen upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that other conviction, that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) duty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) from the burdens of that life to which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) herself had
looked forward so fondly. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) should judge
of the necessity; swearing to herself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) judgment, let it be
what it might, should be right to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had perceived that
this was not sufficient;--that in this way there would be no escape
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>);--that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) herself must make the decision, and proclaim
it. Very tenderly and very cautiously had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gone about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) task;
feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) way to the fact that this separation, if it came from
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), would be deemed expedient by him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). That she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would be right in all
this, was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) great resolve; that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might after all be wrong, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
constant fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), too, had heard of public censors, of the girl of
the period, and of the forward indelicacy with which women of the
age were charged. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew not why, but it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that the
laws of the world around her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) demanded more of such rectitude from
a woman than from a man, and, if it might be possible to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
would comply with these laws. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had convinced herself, forming her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
judgment from every tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, from every glance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye,
from every word that fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, that this separation would
be expedient for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And then, assuring herself that the task should
be hers, and not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done it. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done it, and, counting
up the cost afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had found herself to be broken in pieces.
That wholeness and roundness, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had rejoiced, had gone
from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) altogether. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would try to persuade herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could
live as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) aunt had lived, and yet be whole and round. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tried,
but knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) failed. The life to which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had looked forward
had been the life of a married woman; and now, as that was taken from
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could be but a thing broken, a fragment of humanity, created
for use, but never to be used.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bore all this well, for a while,--and indeed never ceased to bear
it well, to the eyes of those around her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). When Parson John told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
of Walter's hunting, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) laughed, and said that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would
distinguish himself. When her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) aunt on one occasion congratulated
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), telling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done well and nobly, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bore the
congratulation with a smile and a kind word. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought about it
much, and within the chambers of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own bosom there were complaints
made that the play which had been played between him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) during
the last few months should for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) have been such a very tragedy,
while for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) the matter was no more than a melodrama, touched with
a pleasing melancholy. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had not been made a waif upon the waters
by the misfortune of a few weeks, by the error of a lawyer, by a
mistaken calculation,--not even by the crime of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) father. His (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
manhood was, at any rate, perfect to him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>). Though he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) might be a poor
man, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was still a man with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hands free, and with something
before him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) could do. She (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) understood, too, that the rough
work of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) life would be such that it would rub away, perhaps too
quickly, the impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) late love, and enable him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hereafter
to love another. But for her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>),--for her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) there could be nothing but
memory, regrets, and a life which would simply be a waiting for
death. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had done nothing wrong,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) must console herself
with that, if consolation could then be found.

<p/>Then there came to her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) a letter from Mrs. Fenwick which moved her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
much. It was the second which she (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had received from her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) friend since
she (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had made it known that she (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was no longer engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) cousin.
In her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) former letter Mrs. Fenwick had simply expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) opinion
that Mary had done rightly, and had, at the same time, promised that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would write again, more at length, when the passing by of a few
weeks should have so far healed the first agony of the wound, as to
make it possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to speak of the future. Mary, dreading this
second letter, had done nothing to elicit it; but at last it came.
And as it had some effect on Mary Lowther's future conduct, it shall
be given to the reader:--


<p/>Bullhampton Vicarage, March 12, 186--.

<p/>DEAREST MARY,

<p/>I do so wish you were here, if it were only to share our
misery with us. I did not think that so small a thing as
the building of a wretched chapel could have put me out so
much, and made me so uncomfortable as this has done. Frank
says that it is simply the feeling of being beaten,--the
insult not the injury, which is the grievance; but they
both rankle with me. I hear the click of the trowel every
hour, and though I never go near the front gate, yet I
know that it is all muddy and foul with brickbats and
mortar. I don't think that anything so cruel and unjust
was ever done before; and the worst of it is that Frank,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) hates it just as much as I do, does preach
such sermons to me about the wickedness of caring for
small evils. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose you had to go to it every Sunday
yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) said the other day, trying to make me
understand what a real depth of misery there is in the
world. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind that half so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) bade me try it,--which wasn't fair because he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
knows I can't. However, they say it will all tumble down
because it has been built so badly.

<p/>I have been waiting to hear from you, but I can understand
why you should not write. You do not wish to speak of your
cousin, or to write without speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). Your aunt has
written to me twice, as doubtless you know, and has told
me that you are well, only more silent than heretofore.
Dearest Mary, do write to me, and tell me what is in
your heart. I will not ask you to come to us,--not
yet,--because of our neighbour; but I do think that if you
were here I could do you good. I know so well, or fancy
that I know so well, the current in which your thoughts
are running! You have had a wound, and think that
therefore you must be a cripple for life. But it is not
so; and such thoughts, if not wicked, are at least wrong.
I would that it had been otherwise. I would that you had
not met your cousin.--


<p/><div class="bookquote">``So would not I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary to herself; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said it she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was wrong. Of course it would be for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) welfare, and for
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) too, if his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) heart was as hers, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should never have seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).--


<p/>But because you have met him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and have fancied that you
and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would be all in all together, you will be wrong
indeed if you let that fancy ruin your future life. Or
if you encourage yourself to feel that, because you
have loved one man from whom you are necessarily parted,
therefore you should never allow yourself to become
attached to another, you will indeed be teaching yourself
an evil lesson. I think I can understand the arguments
with which you may perhaps endeavour to persuade your
heart that its work of loving has been done, and should
not be renewed; but I am quite sure that they are false
and inhuman. The Indian, indeed, allows herself to be
burned through a false idea of personal devotion; and if
that idea be false in a widow, how much falser is it in
one who has never been a wife.

<p/>You know what have ever been our wishes. They are the same
now as heretofore; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) constancy is of that nature,
that nothing will ever change it. I am persuaded that it
would have been unchanged, even if you had married your
cousin, though in that case he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would have been studious to
keep out of your way. I do not mean to press his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) claims at
present. I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should be patient, and
that if the thing be to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) as important as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) makes it,
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should be content to wait. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would
wait. I ask for no word from you at present on this
subject. It will be much better that there should be no
word. But it is right that you should know that there is
one who loves you with a devotion which nothing can alter.

<p/>I will only add to this my urgent prayer that you will not
make too much to yourself of your own misfortune, or allow
yourself to think that because this and that have taken
place, therefore everything must be over. It is hard to
say who makes the greatest mistakes, women who treat their
own selves with too great a reverence, or they who do so
with too little.

<p/>Frank sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) kindest love. Write to me at once, if only
to condole with me about the chapel.

<p/>Most affectionately yours,

<p/>JANET FENWICK.

<p/>My sister and Mr. Quickenham are coming here for
Easter week, and I have still some hopes of getting my
brother-in-law to put us up to some way of fighting the
Marquis and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) myrmidons. I have always heard it said
that there was no case in which Mr. Quickenham couldn't
make a fight.


<p/>Mary Lowther understood well the whole purport of this letter,--all
that was meant as well as all that was written. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had told herself
again and again that there had been that between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) and the lover
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had lost,--tender embraces, warm kisses, a bird-like pressure
of the plumage,--which alone should make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) deem it unfit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
should be to another man as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), even should her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
heart allow it. It was against this doctrine that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) friend had
preached, with more or less of explicitness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) sermon. And how
was the truth? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could take a lesson on that subject from any
human being in the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would take it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) friend Janet
Fenwick. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) rebelled against the preaching, and declared to
herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) friend had never been tried, and therefore did not
understand the case. Must she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) not be guided by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own feelings, and
did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) not feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could never lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) head on the shoulder of
another lover without blushing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) memories of the past?

<p/>And yet how hard was it all! It was not the joys of young love
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) regretted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) present mood, not the loss of those soft
delights of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had suddenly found herself to be so capable;
but that all the world should be dark and dreary before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)! And he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
could hunt, could dance, could work,--no doubt could love again! How
happy would it be for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) if her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) reason would allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to be a Roman
Catholic, and a nun!




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII.

<p/>A LOVER``S MADNESS.


<p/>The letter from Mrs. Fenwick, which the reader has just seen, was the
immediate effect of a special visit which Mr. Gilmore had made to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). On the 10th of March he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) with a settled purpose,
pointing out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had now waited a certain number of months
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had heard of the rupture between Mary and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin, naming
the exact period which Mrs. Fenwick had bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wait before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
should move again in the matter, and asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) might not
now venture to take some step. Mrs. Fenwick had felt it to be unfair
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) very words should be quoted against her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), as to the three or
four months, feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had said three or four instead of six
or seven to soften the matter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend; but, nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
had been induced to write to Mary Lowther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking that perhaps you might ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to come to you
again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gilmore had said when Mrs. Fenwick rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
impatience. <div class="bookquote">``If you did that, the thing might come on naturally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) wouldn't come if I did ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) hates me so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) will not venture to come near
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense that is, Harry. It has nothing to do with hating. If I
thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) even disliked you, I should tell you so, believing
that it would be for the best. But of course if I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) here
just at present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could not but remember that you are our nearest
neighbour, and feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was pressed to come with some reference
to your hopes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would not come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly; and if you will think of it, how could it be otherwise?
Wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is in India. Wait at any rate till the summer, and then
Frank and I will do our best to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore, and immediately took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) leave, as
though there were no other subject of conversation now possible to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>).

<p/>Since his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) return from Loring, Mr. Gilmore's life at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own house had
been quite secluded. Even the Fenwicks had hardly seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), though
they lived so near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had rarely been at church, had seen no
company at home since his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) uncle, the prebendary, had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and
had not dined even at the Vicarage more than once or twice. All this
had of course been frequently discussed between Mr. and Mrs. Fenwick,
and had made the Vicar very unhappy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had expressed a fear that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend would be driven half crazy by a foolish indulgence in a
hopeless passion, and had suggested that it might perhaps be for the
best that Gilmore should let his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) place and travel abroad for two
or three years, so that, in that way, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) disappointment might be
forgotten. But Mrs. Fenwick still hoped better things than this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
probably thought more of Mary Lowther than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) did of Harry Gilmore,
and still believed that a cure for both their sorrows might be found,
if one would only be patient, and the other would not despair.

<p/>Mr. Gilmore had promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would wait, and then Mrs. Fenwick
had written her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) letter. To this there came a very quick answer. In
respect to the trouble about the chapel, Mary Lowther was sympathetic
and droll, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would have been had there been upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) the weight
of no love misfortune. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had trust,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) said, ``in Mr. Quickenham,
who no doubt would succeed in harassing the enemy, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>)
might be unable to obtain ultimate conquest. And then there seemed
to be a fair prospect that the building would fall of itself, which
surely would be a great triumph. And, after all, might it not fairly
be hoped that the pleasantness of the Vicarage garden, which Mr.
Puddleham must see every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) visited his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) chapel, might be quite
as galling and as vexatious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) as would be the ugliness of the
Methodist building to the Fenwicks?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should take comfort in the reflection that his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) sides will be
quite as full of thorns as your own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary; <div class="bookquote">``and perhaps there
may come some blessed opportunity for crushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) altogether by
heaping hot coals of fire on his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) head. Offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) the use of the
Vicarage lawn for one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) school tea-parties, and that, I should
think, would about finish him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>This was all very well, and was written on purpose to show to Mrs.
Fenwick that Mary could still be funny in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) troubles; but
the pith of the letter, as Mrs. Fenwick well understood, lay in the
few words of the last paragraph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't suppose, dear, that I am going to die of a broken heart. I
mean to live and to be as happy as any of you. But you must let me go
on in my own way. I am not at all sure that being married is not more
trouble than it is worth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>That she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was deceiving herself in saying this Mary knew well enough;
and Mrs. Fenwick, too, guessed that it was so. Nevertheless, it was
plain enough that nothing more could be said about Mr. Gilmore just
at present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to blow him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) up, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) come to us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Fenwick
said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all very well to say that, but one man can't blow another
up, as women do. Men don't talk to each other about the things that
concern them nearly,--unless it be about money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do they talk about, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About matters that don't concern them nearly;--game, politics, and
the state of the weather. If I were to mention Mary's name to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would feel it to be an impertinence. You can say what you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon after this, Gilmore came again to the Vicarage; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was
careful to come when the Vicar would not be there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) sauntered into
the garden by the little gate from the churchyard, and showed himself
at the drawing-room window, without going round to the front door. <div class="bookquote">``I
never go to the front now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick; <div class="bookquote">``I have only once been
through the gate since they began to build.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is not that very inconvenient?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is. When we came home from dining at Sir Thomas's the
other day, I had myself put down at the church gate, and walked all
the way round, though it was nearly pitch dark. Do come in, Harry.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Do come in, Harry.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>Then Mr. Gilmore came in, and seated himself before the fire. Mrs.
Fenwick understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) moods so well, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would not say a word
to hurry him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) chose to talk about Mary Lowther, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) knew very
well what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would not herself introduce
the subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) spoke for awhile about the Brattles, saying that the
old man had suffered much since his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son had gone from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Sam had
left Bullhampton at the end of January, never having returned to the
mill after his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) visit to the Vicar, and had not been heard of since.
Gilmore, however, had not been to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) tenant; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
expressed an interest about the Brattles, had manifestly come to
the Vicarage with the object of talking upon matters more closely
interesting to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you write to Loring, Mrs. Fenwick?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) asked at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wrote to Mary soon after you were last here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And has she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wrote again almost at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not but write, as I
had said so much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) about the chapel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not allude to--anything else, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't quite say that, Harry. I had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) out of a
very full heart, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) what I thought as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) future life
generally, and just alluding to our wishes respecting you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said just what might have been expected,--that for the present
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would rather be let alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) alone. I have neither spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nor written to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) does not mean to say that I have troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you have not troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knows what we all
mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have waited all the winter, Mrs. Fenwick, and have said not a
word. How long was it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) cousin before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was engaged
to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has that to do with it? You know what our wishes are; but,
indeed, indeed, nothing can be done by hurrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was engaged to that man, and the engagement broken off all
within a month. It was no more than a dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the remembrance of such dreams will not fade away quickly.
Let us hope that hereafter it may be as a dream;--but time must be
allowed to efface the idea of its reality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Time;--yes; but cannot we arrange some plan for the future? Cannot
something be done? I thought you said you would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to come

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I did,--but not yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) come now? You needn't ask because I am here. There
is no saying whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) may meet, and then my chance will be gone
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all you know about women, Harry? Do you think that the girl
whom you love so dearly will take up with one man after another in
that fashion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can say? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not very long in taking up, as you call it,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you would see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and of course you would propose

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there is no hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not say that. Wait till the summer comes; and then, if I can

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is wearisome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then go up to London--or abroad--or anywhere for a change. Take some

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is so easily said, Mrs. Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No man ever did anything by moping; and you mope. I know I am
speaking plainly, and you may be angry with me, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all angry with you; but I think you hardly understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, speaking with all the energy
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could command; <div class="bookquote">``and I am most anxious to do all that you wish.
But it cannot be done in a day. If I were to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would
not come; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) came it would not be for your good. Wait till
the summer. You may be sure that no harm will be done by a little
patience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) went away, declaring again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would wait with patience;
but saying, at the same time, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would remain at home. <div class="bookquote">``As for
going to London,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I should do nothing there. When I find
that there is no chance left, then probably I shall go abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my belief,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, that evening, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) what had occurred, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) will never have him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); not because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
does not like him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), or could not learn to like him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) were as other
men are, but simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is so unreasonably unhappy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).
No woman was ever got by that sort of puling and whining love. If it
were not that I think him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) crazy, I should say that it was unmanly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is crazy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will be still worse before he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has done with it. Anything would
be good now which would take him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) away from Bullhampton. It would be a
mercy that his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) house should be burned down, or that some great loss
should fall upon him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sits there at home, and does nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
will not even look after the farm. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pretends to read, but I don't
believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) does even that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And all because he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is really in love, Frank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad that I have never been in love with the same
reality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never had any need, sir. The plums fell into your mouth too
easily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plums shouldn't be too difficult,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, <div class="bookquote">``or they lose
their sweetness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>A few days after this Mr. Fenwick was standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own gate,
watching the building of the chapel and talking to the men, when
Fanny Brattle from the mill came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would stand there by
the hour at a time, and had made quite a friendship with the foreman
of the builder from Salisbury, although the foreman, like his (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) master,
was a Dissenter, and had come into the parish as an enemy. All
Bullhampton knew how infinite was the disgust of the Vicar at what
was being done; and that Mrs. Fenwick felt it so strongly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
would not even go in and out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own gate. All Bullhampton was
aware that Mr. Puddleham spoke openly of the Vicar as his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) enemy,--in
spite of the peaches and cabbages on which the young Puddlehams
had been nourished; and that the Methodist minister had, more than
once within the last month or two, denounced his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) brother of the
Established Church from his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) own pulpit. All Bullhampton was talking
of the building of the chapel,--some abusing the Marquis and Mr.
Puddleham and the Salisbury builder; others, on the other hand,
declaring that it was very good that the Establishment should have a
fall. Nevertheless there Mr. Fenwick would stand and chat with the
men, fascinated after a fashion by the misfortune which had come upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). Mr. Packer, the Marquis's steward, had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>) there, and had
endeavoured to slink away unobserved,--for Mr. Packer was somewhat
ashamed of the share he (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>) had had in the matter,--but Mr. Fenwick had
called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), and had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) of the progress of the building.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grimes never could have done it so fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,--not so fast, Mr. Fenwick, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it won't signify about the frost?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``I
should be inclined to think that the mortar will want repointing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Packer/Mr. Packer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Packer had nothing to say to this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>) was not responsible for the
building. He (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>) endeavoured to explain that the Marquis had nothing to
do with the work, and had simply given the land.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which was all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, laughing.

<p/>It was on the same day and while Packer was still standing close to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>), that Fanny Brattle accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>) had greeted the young
woman and perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) wished to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>) withdrew
within his (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>) own gate, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) whether there was anything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>)
could do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had a letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) hand, and after a little
hesitation she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>) to read it. It was from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) brother, and had
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) by private means. A young man had brought it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father was in the mill, and had then gone off, declining to wait
for any answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, sir, knows nothing about it as yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said.

<p/>Mr. Fenwick took the letter and read it. It was as follows:--


<p/>DEAR SISTER,

<p/>I want you to help me a little, for things is very bad
with me. And it is not for me neither, or I'd sooner
starve nor ax for a sixpence from the mill. But Carry is
bad too, and if you've got a trifle or so, I think you'd
be of a mind to send it. But don't tell father, on no
account. I looks to you not to tell father. Tell mother,
if you will; but I looks to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not to mention it to
father. If it be so you have two pounds by you, send it to
me in a letter, to the care of

<p/>Muster Thomas Craddock,
Number 5, Crooked Arm Yard,
Cowcross Street,
City of London.

<p/>My duty to mother, but don't say a word to father,
whatever you do. Carry don't live nowhere there, nor they
don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>Your affectionate brother,

<p/>SAM BRATTLE.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you told your father, Fanny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor your mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, sir. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has read the letter, and thinks I had better come
to you to ask what we should do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got the money, Fanny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny Brattle explained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) pocket something over the
sum named, but that money was so scarce with them now at the mill,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could hardly send it without her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father's knowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
would not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said, be afraid to send it and then to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father
afterwards. The Vicar considered the matter for some time, standing
with the open letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) hand, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) advice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come into the house, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and write a line to your
brother, and then get a money order at the post-office for four
pounds, and send it to your brother; and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that I lend it
to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) till times shall be better with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Do not give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) your
father's money without your father's leave. Sam will pay me some day,
unless I be mistaken in him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Fanny Brattle with many grateful thanks did as the Vicar bade
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX.

<p/>THE THREE HONEST MEN.


<p/>The Vicar of Bullhampton was--a <div class="bookquote">``good sort of fellow.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bullhampton/BULLHAMPTON</b></font>)</div>In praise of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) to this extent it is hoped that the reader will cordially agree.
But it cannot be denied that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was the most imprudent of men. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
had done very much that was imprudent in respect to the Marquis of
Trowbridge; and since he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had been at Bullhampton had been imprudent
in nearly everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had done regarding the Brattles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was
well aware that the bold words which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had spoken to the Marquis had
been dragon's teeth sown by himself, and that they had sprung up from
the ground in the shape of the odious brick building which now stood
immediately in face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own Vicarage gate. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would smile
and be droll, and talk to the workmen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hated that building quite
as bitterly as did his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) wife. And now, in regard to the Brattles,
there came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) a great trouble. About a week after he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had lent
the four pounds to Fanny on Sam's behalf, there came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) a dirty
note from Salisbury, written by Sam himself, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was told
that Carry Brattle was now at the Three Honest Men, a public-house in
one of the suburbs of the city, waiting there till Mr. Fenwick should
find a home for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),--in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) promise given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
brother. Sam, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) letter, had gone on to explain that it would be
well that Mr. Fenwick should visit the Three Honest Men speedily, as
otherwise there would be a bill there which neither Carry nor Sam
would be able to defray. Poor Sam's letter was bald, and they who did
not understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) position might have called it bold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) wrote to
the Vicar as though the Vicar's coming to Salisbury for the required
purpose was a matter of course; and demanded a home for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) sister
without any reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) future mode of life, or power of earning
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bread, as though it was the Vicar's manifest duty to provide such
home. And then that caution in regard to the bill was rather a threat
than anything else. If you don't take her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) quickly from the Three
Honest Men there'll be the very mischief of a bill for you to pay.
That was the meaning of the caution, and so the Vicar understood it.

<p/>But Mr. Fenwick, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was imprudent, was neither unreasonable
nor unintelligent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had told Sam Brattle that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would provide
a home for Carry, if Sam would find his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sister and induce her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to
accept the offer. Sam had gone to work, and had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) part. Having
done it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was right to claim from the Vicar his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) share of the
performance. And then, was it not a matter of course that Carry, when
found, should be without means to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own expenses? Was it to be
supposed that a girl in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) position would have money by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). And had
not Mr. Fenwick known the truth about their poverty when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had given
those four pounds to Fanny Brattle to be sent up to Sam in London?
Mr. Fenwick was both reasonable and intelligent as to all this; and,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was in trouble, did not for a moment think
of denying his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) responsibility, or evading the performance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
promise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) must find a home for poor Carry, and pay any bill at the
Three Honest Men which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might find standing there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) name.

<p/>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) trouble to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife; and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was
scolded for the promise he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had given. <div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Frank, if for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), why not for others; and how is it possible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and not for others, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is an old friend, a
neighbour's child, and one of the parish.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That question was easily
answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how is it possible, Frank? Of course one would do anything that
it is possible to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). What I mean is, that one would do it for
all of them, if only it were possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can do it for one, will not even that be much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is to be done? Who will take her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)? Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) go into a
reformatory?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are so many, and I do not know how they are to be treated
except in a body. Where can you find a home for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has a married sister, Janet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>), or let her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) inside the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) house!
Surely, Frank, you know the unforgiving nature of women of that class
for such sin as poor Carry Brattle's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether they ever say their prayers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they do. Mrs. Jay, no doubt, is a religious woman. But it
is permitted to them not to forgive that sin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By what law?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the law of custom. It is all very well, Frank, but you can't
fight against it. At any rate, you can't ignore it till it has been
fought against and conquered. And it is useful. It keeps women from
going astray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think, then, that nothing should be done for this poor creature,
who fell so piteously, with so small a sin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not said so. But when you promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) a home, where did
you think of finding one for her (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) only fitting home is with her (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
mother, and you know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) father will not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Fenwick said nothing more at that moment, not having clearly made
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) mind as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might best do; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had before his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) eyes,
dimly, a plan by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought it possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might force
Carry Brattle on her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father's heart. If this plan might be carried
out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) to the mill-house and seat her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) in the room
in which the family lived, and then bring the old man in from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
work. It might be that Jacob Brattle, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) wrath, would turn with
violence upon the man who had dared thus to interfere in the affairs
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) family; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) would certainly offer no rough usage to the
poor girl. Fenwick knew the man well enough to be sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would
not lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) hands in anger upon a woman.

<p/>But something must be done at once,--something before any such plan
as that which was running through his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) brain could be matured and
carried into execution. There was Carry at the Three Honest Men, and,
for aught the Vicar knew, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother staying with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>),
the Vicar's credit, pledged for their maintenance. It was quite clear
that something must be done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had applied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
wife did not know how to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had suggested the wife of the
ironmonger at Warminster as the proper guardian for the poor child,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own wife had at once made him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) understand that this was
impractical. Indeed, how was it possible that such a one as Carry
Brattle should be kept out of sight and stowed away in an open
hardware-shop in a provincial town? The properest place for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would
be in the country, on some farm; and, so thinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) determined to
apply to the girl's eldest brother.

<p/>George Brattle was a prosperous man, living on a large farm near
Fordingbridge, ten or twelve miles the other side of Salisbury. Of
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the Vicar knew very little, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife nothing. That the man
had been married fourteen or fifteen years, and had a family growing
up, the Vicar did know; and, knowing it, feared that Mrs. Brattle of
Startup, as their farm was called, would not be willing to receive
this proposed new inmate. But he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) would try. He (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) would go on to Startup
after having seen Carry at the Three Honest Men, and use what
eloquence he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) could command for the occasion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) drove himself over on the next day to meet an early train, and
was in Salisbury by nine o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) had to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) way to the Three
Honest Men, and at last had some difficulty in finding the house.
It was a small beershop, in a lane on the very outskirts of the
city, and certainly seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) looked at it, to be as
disreputable a house, in regard to its outward appearance, as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>)
had proposed to enter. It was a brick building of two stories, with a
door in the middle of it which stood open, and a red curtain hanging
across the window on the left-hand side. Three men dressed like
navvies were leaning against the door-posts. There is no sign,
perhaps, which gives to a house of this class so disreputable an
appearance as red curtains hung across the window; and yet there is
no other colour for pot-house curtains that has any popularity. The
one fact probably explains the other. A drinking-room with a blue or
a brown curtain would offer no attraction to the thirsty navvy who
likes to have his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) thirst indulged without criticism. But, in spite of
the red curtain, Fenwick entered the house, and asked the uncomely
woman at the bar after Sam Brattle. Was there a man named Sam Brattle
staying there;--a man with a sister?

<p/>Then were let loose against the unfortunate clergyman the floodgates
of a drunken woman's angry tongue. It was not only that the landlady
of the Three Honest Men was very drunk, but also that she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was very
angry. Sam Brattle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) sister had been there, but they had been
turned out of the house. There had manifestly been some great row,
and Carry Brattle was spoken of with all the worst terms of reproach
which one woman can heap upon the name of another. The mistress of
the Three Honest Men was a married woman,--and, as far as that went,
respectable; whereas poor Carry was not married, and certainly not
respectable. Something of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) past history had been known. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
been called names which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not repudiate, and the truth of
which even her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) behalf could not deny; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
been turned into the street. So much Mr. Fenwick learned from the
drunken woman, and nothing more he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could learn. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) asked after
Carry's present address the woman jeered at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), and accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) of
base purposes in coming after such a one. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood with arms akimbo
in the passage, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would raise the neighbourhood on him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was drunk, and dirty, as foul a thing as the eye could look upon;
every other word was an oath, and no phrase used by the lowest of
men in their lowest moments was too hot or too bad for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) woman's
tongue; and yet there was the indignation of outraged virtue in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
demeanour and in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) language, because this stranger had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
door asking after a girl who had been led astray. Our Vicar cared
nothing for the neighbourhood, and, indeed, cared very little for
the woman at all,--except in so far as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) disgusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) did
care much at finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could obtain no clue to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was
seeking. The woman would not even tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) when the girl had left
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) house, or give him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) any assistance towards finding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had at
first endeavoured to mollify the virago by offering to pay the amount
of any expenses which might have been left unsettled; but even on
this score he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could obtain no consideration. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) continued to revile
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was obliged to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) did, at last, with a
hurried step to avoid a quart pot which the woman had taken up to
hurl at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) head, upon some comparison which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) most indiscreetly
made between herself and poor Carry Brattle.

<p/>What should he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) do now? The only chance of finding the girl was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
thought, to go to the police-office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was still in the lane, making
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) way back to the street which would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) into the city,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was accosted by a little child. <div class="bookquote">``You be the parson,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said
the child. Mr. Fenwick owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was a parson. <div class="bookquote">``Parson from
Bull`umpton?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child, inquiringly. Mr. Fenwick acknowledged
the fact. <div class="bookquote">``Then you be to come with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Whereupon Mr. Fenwick
followed the child, and was led into a miserable little court in
which population was squalid, thick, and juvenile. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) be here, at
Mrs. Stiggs's,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child. Then the Vicar understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had
been watched, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was being taken to the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was seeking had found shelter.




<p/>CHAPTER XL.

<p/>TROTTER``S BUILDINGS.


<p/>In the back room up-stairs of Mr. Stiggs's house in Trotter's
Buildings the Vicar did find Carry Brattle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) found also that
since her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) coming thither on the preceding evening,--for only on the
preceding evening had she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) been turned away from the Three Honest
Men,--one of Mrs. Stiggs's children had been on the look-out in the
lane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought that you would come to me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carry Brattle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I should come. Did I not promise that I would come? And
where is your brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>But Sam had left her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) in Mrs. Stiggs's
house, and Carry could not say whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had brought
her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) to Salisbury, and had remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) two days at the Three
Honest Men, during which time the remainder of their four pounds
had been spent; and then there had been a row. Some visitors to the
house recognised poor Carry, or knew something of her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) tale, and evil
words were spoken. There had been a fight and Sam had thrashed some
man,--or some half-dozen men, if all that Carry said was true. She (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>)
had fled from the house in sad tears, and after a while her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) brother
had joined her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>),--bloody, with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lip cut and a black eye. It seemed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had had some previous knowledge of this woman who lived in
Trotter's Buildings,--had known her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband,--and there he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
found shelter for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sister, having explained that a clergyman would
call for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) modest wants, and then take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) away.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) supposed that Sam had gone back to London; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had been so
bruised and mauled in the fight that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had determined that Mr.
Fenwick should not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). This was the story as Carry told it; and
Mr. Fenwick did not for a moment doubt its truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, Carry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what is it that you would do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) face, and yet not wholly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) face,--as
though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were afraid to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes so high,--and was silent.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) were intently fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) stood over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had never seen a sight more sad to look at. And yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very pretty,--prettier, perhaps, than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been in the
days when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would come up the aisle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) church, to take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
place among the singers, with red cheeks and bright flowing clusters
of hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was pale now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could see that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheeks were
rough,--from paint, perhaps, and late hours, and an ill-life; but
the girl had become a woman, and the lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) countenance were
fixed, and were very lovely, and there was a pleading eloquence about
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth for which there had been no need in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) happy days at
Bullhampton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would do! But had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not come
there, at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brother's instigation, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
should do? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would find her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a home if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) evil ways? How was it possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should have a
plan for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) future life? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not a word; but tried to
look into his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face and failed.

<p/>Nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) any formed plan. That idea, indeed, of going to Startup
had come across his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brain,--of going to Startup, and of asking
assistance from the prosperous elder brother. But so diffident was he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
of success that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hardly dared to mention it to the poor girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hard to say what you should do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very hard, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) heart was so tender towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could not bring himself
to propose to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the cold and unpleasant safety of a Reformatory. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
knew, as a clergyman and as a man of common sense, that to place her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
in such an establishment would, in truth, be the greatest kindness
that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could do her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could not do it. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own
conscience by telling himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would accept no
such refuge. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had half promised not to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to
go to any such place. At any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had not meant that when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had
made his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) rash promise to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brother; and though that promise was
rash, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was not the less bound to keep it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very pretty, and
still soft, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) well. Was it a fault in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was tender to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) because of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) prettiness, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had loved
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as a child? We must own that it was a fault. The crooked places
of the world, if they are to be made straight at all, must be made
straight after a sterner and a juster fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you could stay here for a day or two?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only that I've got no money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will see to that,--for a few days, you know. And I was thinking
that I would go to your brother George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--why not? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not always good to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was never bad, sir; only--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been so bad, sir, that I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'d speak to me, or
notice me, or do anything for me. And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has got a wife, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But a woman doesn't always become hard-hearted as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is
married. There must be some of them that will take pity on you,
Carry.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only shook her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that it is his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
duty, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) be an honest, God-fearing man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And should I have to go there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will take you--certainly. What better could you wish? Your
father is hard, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loves you still, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cannot bring
himself to forget.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can any of them forget, Mr. Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go out at once to Startup, and as I return through Salisbury
I will let you know what your brother says.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again shook her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
head. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate, we must try, Carry. When things are difficult,
they cannot be mended by people sitting down and crying. I will
ask your brother; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) refuses, I will endeavour to think of
something else. Next to your father and mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is certainly the
first that should be asked to look to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said much to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
as to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) condition, preached to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the little sermon with which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
had come prepared; was as stern to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) nature and love would
allow,--though, indeed, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) words were tender enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) strove to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could have no escape from the dirt and
vileness and depth of misery into which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had fallen, without the
penalty of a hard, laborious life, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must submit to be
regarded as one whose place in the world was very low. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not hate the disgrace and the ignominy and the vile
wickedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) late condition. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes still only half-raised towards him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). What other answer
could she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) make? He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would fain have drawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) some deep and
passionate expression of repentance, some fervid promise of future
rectitude, some eager offer to bear all other hardships, so that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might be saved from a renewal of the past misery. But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew
that no such eloquence, no such energy, no such ecstacy, would be
forthcoming. And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew, also, that humble, contrite, and wretched
as was the girl now, the nature within her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bosom was not changed.
Were he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to place her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in a reformatory, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not stay there. Were
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to make arrangements with Mrs. Stiggs, who in her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) way seemed to
be a decent, hard-working woman,--to make arrangements for her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) board
and lodging, with some collateral regulations as to occupation,
needle-work, and the like,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) would not adhere to them. The change
from a life of fevered, though most miserable, excitement, to one of
dull, pleasureless, and utterly uninteresting propriety, is one that
can hardly be made without the assistance of binding control. Could
she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) have been sent to the mill, and made subject to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) mother's
softness as well as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) mother's care, there might have been room
for confident hope. And then, too,--but let not the reader read this
amiss,--because she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) was pretty and might be made bright again, and
because he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was young, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) longed, were it
possible, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) paths pleasant for her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) fall, her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) first
fall had been piteous to him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), rather than odious. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), too, would have
liked to get hold of the man and to have left him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) without a sound
limb within his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) skin,--to have left him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) pretty nearly without a skin
at all; but that work had fallen into the miller's hands, who had
done it fairly well. And, moreover, it would hardly have fitted the
Vicar. But, as regarded Carry herself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
solitary rambles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would build little castles in the air on her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>)
behalf, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) life should be anything but one of sackcloth and
ashes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would find for her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) some loving husband, who should know
and should have forgiven the sin which had hardly been a sin, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) should be a loving wife with loving children. Perhaps, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
would add to this, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) built his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) castles, the sweet smiles of
affectionate gratitude with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) himself would be received when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) happy hearth. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) knew that these were castles
in the air, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) endeavoured to throw them all behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
preached his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) sermon. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was very tender with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>),
and treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) not at all as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would have done an ugly young
parishioner who had turned thief upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, Carry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I will get a gig in the
town, and will drive over to your brother. We can but try it. I am
clear as to this, that the best thing for you will be to be among
your own people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it would, sir; but I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll ever be brought to
have me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will try, at any rate. And if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will have you, you must
remember that you must not eat the bread of idleness. You must be
prepared to work for your living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to be idle, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) by the hand, and
pressed it, and bade God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>), and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) a little money in
order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) might make some first payment to Mrs. Stiggs. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
sure I don't know why you should do all this for the likes of me,
sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, bursting into tears. The Vicar did not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) did it because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was gracious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) eyes, and perhaps was
not aware of the fact himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) went to the Dragon of Wantley, and there procured a gig. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had
a contest in the inn-yard before they would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) have the gig
without a man to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) managed it at last, fearing that
the driver might learn something of his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) errand. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) had never been at
Startup Farm before; and knew very little of the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going
to see on so very delicate a mission; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did know that George
Brattle was prosperous, and that in early life he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been a good
son. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last interview with the farmer had had reference to the
matter of bail required for Sam, and on that occasion the brother
had, with some persuasion, done as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was asked. George Brattle had
contrived to win for himself a wife from the Fordingbridge side of
the country, who had had a little money; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), too, had carried
away from the mill a little money in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father's prosperous days,
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had done very well. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) paid his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) rent to the day, owed no man
anything, and went to church every other Sunday, eschewing the bad
example set to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father in matters of religion. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
hard-fisted, ignorant, and self-confident, knowing much about corn
and the grinding of it, knowing something of sheep and the shearing
of them, knowing also how to get the worth of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ten or eleven
shillings a week out of the bones of the rural labourers;--but
knowing very little else. Of all this Fenwick was aware; and, in
spite of that church-going twice a month, rated the son as inferior
to the father; for about the old miller there was a stubborn
constancy which almost amounted to heroism. With such a man as was
this George Brattle, how was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to preach a doctrine of true human
charity with any chance of success? But the man was one who was
pervious to ideas of duty, and might be probably pervious to feelings
of family respect. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been good to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father and mother,
regarding with something of true veneration the nest from which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had sprung. The Vicar did not like the task before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), dreading the
disappointment which failure would produce; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was not the man to
shrink from any work which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had resolved to undertake, and drove
gallantly into the farmyard, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) saw both the farmer and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
wife standing at the back-door of the house.




<p/>CHAPTER XLI.

<p/>STARTUP FARM.


<p/>Farmer Brattle, who was a stout man about thirty-eight years of age
but looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were nearly ten years older, came up to the
Vicar, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) hat, and then putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) hand out in greeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This be a pleasure something like, Muster Fenwick, to see thee
here at Startup. This be my wife. Molly, thou has never seen Muster
Fenwick from Bull`umpton. This be our Vicar, as mother and Fanny says
is the pick of all the parsons in Wiltshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Fenwick got down, and walked into the spacious kitchen,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was cordially welcomed by the stout mistress of Startup
Farm.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was very anxious to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) story to the brother alone. Indeed,
as to that, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) mind was quite made up; but Mrs. Brattle, who within
the doors of that house held a position at any rate equal to that
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) husband, did not seem disposed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the opportunity.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) understood well enough that Mr. Fenwick had not come over from
Bullhampton to shake hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) husband, and to say a few civil
words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) must have business, and that business must be about the
Brattle family. Old Brattle was supposed to be in money difficulties,
and was not this an embassy in search of money? Now Mrs. George
Brattle, who had been born a Huggins, was very desirous that none
of the Huggins money should be sent into the parish of Bullhampton.
When, therefore, Mr. Fenwick asked the farmer to step out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
for a moment, Mrs. George Brattle looked very grave, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
husband apart and whispered a word of caution into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's about the mill, George; and don't you do nothing till you've
spoke to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there came a solid look, almost of grief, upon George's face.
There had been a word or two before this between him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and the wife of
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bosom as to the affairs of the mill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just been seeing somebody at Salisbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>began the Vicar,
abruptly, as soon as they had crossed from the yard behind the house
into the enclosure around the ricks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some one at Salisbury, Muster Fenwick? Is it any one as I knows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One that you did know well, Mr. Brattle. I've seen your sister
Carry.''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>Again there came upon the farmer's face that heavy look,
which was almost a look of grief; but he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) did not at once utter a
word. <div class="bookquote">``Poor young thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>continued the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``Poor, dear,
unfortunate girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brought it on herself, and on all of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, my friend. The light, unguarded folly of a moment has
ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and brought dreadful sorrow upon you all. But something
should be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>);--eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div><p/>Still the brother said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will help, I'm sure, to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from the infamy into which
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must fall if none help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If there's money wanted to get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into any of them places--,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>begun
the farmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't that;--it isn't that, at any rate, as yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What be it, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The personal countenance and friendship of some friend that loves
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). You love your sister, Mr. Brattle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know as I does, Muster Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You used to, and you must still pity her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s been and well-nigh broke the hearts of all on us. There wasn't
one of us as wasn't respectable, till she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) come up;--and now there's
Sam. But a boy as is bad ain't never so bad as a girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brattle/Mr. George Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>It must be understood that in the expression of this opinion Mr.
Brattle was alluding, not to the personal wickedness of the wicked
of the two sexes, but to the effect of their wickedness on those
belonging to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore more should be done to help a girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll stand the money, Muster Fenwick,--if it ain't much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is wanted is a home in your own house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here--at Startup?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; here, at Startup. Your father will not take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither won't I. But it ain't me in such a matter as this. You ask
my missus, and see what she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>)'ll say. Besides, Muster Fenwick, it's
clean out of all reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of all reason to help a sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it be. Sister, indeed! Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) go and make--. I won't say
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>)'s made of herself. Ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) brought trouble and sorrow
enough upon us? Have her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) here! Why, I'm that angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>), I
shouldn't be keeping my hands off her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>). Why didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) keep herself to
herself, and not disgrace the whole family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless, in spite of these strong expressions of opinion, Mr.
Fenwick, by the dint of the bitter words which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) spoke in reference
to the brother's duty as a Christian, did get leave from the farmer
to make the proposition to Mrs. George Brattle,--such permission as
would have bound the brother to accept Carry, providing that Mrs.
George would also consent to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). But even this permission
was accompanied by an assurance that it would not have been given had
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not felt perfectly convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife would not listen for
a moment to the scheme. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife almost with awe, when
Mr. Fenwick left him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to make this second attack. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) has never had
nothing to say to none sich as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
head, as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) alluded both to his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) wife and to his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) sister; <div class="bookquote">``and I ain't
sure as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>)'ll be first-rate civil to any one as mentions sich in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>)
hearing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Fenwick persevered, in spite even of this caution. When
the Vicar re-entered the house, Mrs. George Brattle had retired to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) parlour, and the kitchen was in the hands of the maid-servant.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) followed the lady, however, and found that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been at the
trouble, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) last, of putting on a clean cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
behalf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) began at once, jumping again into the middle of things by
a reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Brattle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``your husband and I have been talking about
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) poor sister Carry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The least said the soonest mended about that one, I'm afeared,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dame</b></font>)</div>said
the dame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I agree with you. Were she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) once placed in safe and kind
hands, the less then said the better. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has left the life she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was
leading--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dame</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They never leaves it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dame</b></font>)</div>said the dame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so seldom that an opportunity is given them. Poor Carry is
at the present moment most anxious to be placed somewhere out of
danger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fenwick, if you ask me, I'd rather not talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>);--I would
indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s been and brought a slur upon us all, the vile thing! If
you ask me, Mr. Fenwick, there ain't nothing too bad for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Fenwick, who, on the other hand, thought that there could be hardly
anything too good for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) poor penitent, was beginning to be angry
with the woman. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) made in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own mind those comparisons
which are common to us all on such occasions. What was the great
virtue of this fat, well-fed, selfish, ignorant woman before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should turn up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nose at a sister who had been
unfortunate? Was it not an abominable case of the Pharisee thanking
the Lord that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was not such a one as the Publican;--whereas the
Publican was in a fair way to heaven?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you would have her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) saved, if it be possible to save her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about saving. If such as them is to be made all's one
as others as have always been decent, I'm sure I don't know who it is
as isn't to be saved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you never read of Mary Magdalen, Mrs. Brattle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have, Mr. Fenwick. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) hadn't got no father, nor
brothers, and sisters, and sisters-in-law, as would be pretty well
broken-hearted when her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) vileness would be cast up again' 'em. Perhaps
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) hadn't got no decent house over her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) head afore she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) begun. I don't
know how that was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our Saviour's tender mercy, then, would not have been wide enough
for such sin as that.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>This the Vicar said with intended irony; but
irony was thrown away on Mrs. George Brattle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Them days and ours isn't the same, Mr. Fenwick, and you can't make
'em the same. And Our Saviour isn't here now to say who is to be a
Mary Magdalen and who isn't. As for Carry Brattle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalen</b></font>) has made her (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalen</b></font>)
bed and she (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalen</b></font>) must lie upon it. We shan't interfere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Fenwick was determined, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would make his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) proposition.
It was almost certain now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could do no good to Carry by making
it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) felt that it would be a pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to make this
self-righteous woman know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) conceived to be her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) duty in the
matter. <div class="bookquote">``My idea was this--that you should take her (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalen</b></font>) in here, and
endeavour to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalen</b></font>) from future evil courses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalen</b></font>) in here?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>shrieked the woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; here. Who is nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalen</b></font>) than a brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if I know it, Mr. Fenwick; and if that is what you have been
saying to Brattle, I must tell you that you've come on a very bad
errand. People, Mr. Fenwick, knows how to manage things such as that
for themselves in their own houses. Strangers don't usually talk
about such things, Mr. Fenwick. Perhaps, Mr. Fenwick, you didn't know
as how we have got girls of our own coming up. Have her (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalen</b></font>) in here--at
Startup? I think I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalen</b></font>) here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Mrs. Brattle--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't Mrs. Brattle me, Mr. Fenwick, for I won't be so treated. And I
must tell you that I don't think it over decent of you,--a clergyman,
and a young man, too, in a way,--to come talking of such a one in a
house like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you have her (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalen</b></font>) starve, or die in a ditch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't no question of starving. Such as her (<font color='blue'><b>Magdalen</b></font>) don't starve. As
long as it lasts, they've the best of eating and drinking,--only
too much of it. There's prisons; let 'em go there if they means
repentance. But they never does,--never, till there ain't nobody to
notice 'em any longer; and by that time they're mostly thieves and
pickpockets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you would do nothing to save your own husband's sister from such
a fate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What business had she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to be sister to any honest man? Think of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s been and done to my children, who wouldn't else have had
nobody to be ashamed of. There never wasn't one of the Hugginses who
didn't behave herself;--that is of the women,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. George,
remembering the misdeeds of a certain drunken uncle of her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own, who
had come to great trouble in a matter of horseflesh. <div class="bookquote">``And now, Mr.
Fenwick, let me beg that there mayn't be another word about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). I
don't know nothing of such women, nor what is their ways, and I don't
want. I never didn't speak a word to such a one in my life, and I
certainly won't begin under my own roof. People knows well enough
what's good for them to do and what isn't without being dictated to
by a clergyman. You'll excuse me, Mr. Fenwick; but I'll just make
bold to say as much as that. Good morning, Mr. Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In the yard, standing close by the gig, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) met the farmer again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't find she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d be of your way of thinking, Muster Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly, Mr. Brattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know'd she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wouldn't. The truth is, Muster Fenwick, that young
women as goes astray after that fashion is just like any sick animal,
as all the animals as ain't comes and sets upon immediately. It's
just as well, too. They knows it beforehand, and it keeps 'em
straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It didn't keep poor Carry straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, by the same token, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must suffer, and so must we all. But,
Muster Fenwick, as far as ten or fifteen pounds goes, if it can be of
use--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>But the Vicar, in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) indignation, repudiated the offer of money, and
drove himself back to Salisbury with his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) heart full of sorrow at the
hardness of the world. What this woman had been saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was
only what the world had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--the world that knows so much
better how to treat an erring sinner than did Our Saviour when on
earth.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) went with his (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) sad news to Mrs. Stiggs's house, and then made terms
for Carry's board and lodging, at any rate, for a fortnight. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>)
said much to the girl as to the disposition of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) would
send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) books, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was to be diligent in needle-work on behalf
of the Stiggs family. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to go to the daily
service in the cathedral,--not so much because he (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) thought that the
public worship was necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as that thus she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would be
provided with a salutary employment for a portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) day. Carry,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) farewell, said very little. Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would stay with
Mrs. Stiggs. That was all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) did say.




<p/>CHAPTER XLII.

<p/>MR. QUICKENHAM, Q.C.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration-RSB-

<p/>On the Thursday in Passion week, which fell on the 6th of April, Mr.
and Mrs. Quickenham came to Bullhampton Vicarage. The lawyer intended
to take a long holiday,--four entire days,--and to return to London
on the following Tuesday; and Mrs. Quickenham meant to be very happy
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is such a comfort to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) out of town, if it's only for two
days,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Quickenham</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Quickenham; <div class="bookquote">``and I do believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has run away this
time without any papers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) portmanteau.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Quickenham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Fenwick, with something of apology in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) tone, explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
sister that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was especially desirous of getting a legal opinion on
this occasion from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) brother-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's mere holiday work,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div>said the barrister's anxious wife.
<div class="bookquote">``There's nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) likes so much as that; but it is the reading of
those horrible long papers by gaslight. I wouldn't mind how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
had to talk, nor yet how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had to write, if it wasn't for all
that weary reading. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) does have juniors with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) now,
but I don't find that it makes much difference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'s at it every
night, sheet after sheet; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) always says he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'s coming up
immediately, it's two or three before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'s in bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Quickenham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Quickenham was three or four years older than her (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) sister, and
Mr. Quickenham was twelve years older than his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) wife. The lawyer
therefore was considerably senior to the clergyman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was at the
Chancery bar, and after the usual years of hard and almost profitless
struggling, had worked himself up into a position in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) income
was very large, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) labours never ending. Since the days in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) had begun to have before his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) eyes some idea of a future career
for himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) had always been struggling hard for a certain goal,
struggling successfully, and yet never getting nearer to the thing
he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) desired. A scholarship had been all in all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) left
school; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) got it, a distant fellowship already loomed before
his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) eyes. That attained was only a step towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) life in London.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) first brief, anxiously as it had been desired, had given no real
satisfaction. As soon as it came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) it was a rung of the ladder
already out of sight. And so it had been all through his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) life, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>)
advanced upwards, making a business, taking a wife to himself, and
becoming the father of many children. There was always something
before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) which was to make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) happy when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reached it. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gown
was of silk, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) income almost greater than his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) desires; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would fain sit upon the Bench, and have at any rate his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) evenings for
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own enjoyment. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) firmly believed now, that that had been the
object of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) constant ambition; though could he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) retrace his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thoughts
as a young man, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would find that in the early days of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) forensic
toils, the silent, heavy, unillumined solemnity of the judge had
appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be nothing in comparison with the glittering
audacity of the successful advocate. He (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) had tried the one, and might
probably soon try the other. And when that time shall have come,
and Mr. Quickenham shall sit upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) seat of honour in the new
Law Courts, passing long, long hours in the tedious labours of
conscientious painful listening; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) will look forward again
to the happy ease of dignified retirement, to the coming time in
which all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) hours will be his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) own. And then, again, when those
unfurnished hours are there, and with them shall have come the
infirmities which years and toil shall have brought, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) mind will
run on once more to that eternal rest in which fees and salary,
honours and dignity, wife and children, with all the joys of
satisfied success, shall be brought together for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) in one perfect
amalgam which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) will call by the name of Heaven. In the meantime, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>)
has now come down to Bullhampton to enjoy himself for four days,--if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) can find enjoyment without his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) law papers.

<p/>Mr. Quickenham was a tall, thin man, with eager gray eyes, and a long
projecting nose, on which, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) enemies in the courts of law were wont
to say, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) wife would hang a kettle, in order that the unnecessary
heat coming from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) mouth might not be wasted. His (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) hair was already
grizzled, and, in the matter of whiskers, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) heavy impatient hand
had nearly altogether cut away the only intended ornament to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>)
face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was a man who allowed himself time for nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) law
work, eating all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) meals as though the saving of a few minutes
in that operation were matter of vital importance, dressing and
undressing at railroad speed, moving ever with a quick, impetuous
step, as though the whole world around him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) went too slowly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was
short-sighted, too, and would tumble about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) unnecessary hurry,
barking his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) shins, bruising his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) knuckles, and breaking most things
that were breakable,--but caring nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) sufferings either in
body or in purse so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was not reminded of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) awkwardness by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) wife. An untidy man he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was, who spilt his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) soup on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) waistcoat
and slobbered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) tea, whose fingers were apt to be ink-stained,
and who had a grievous habit of mislaying papers that were most
material to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) would bellow to the servants to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) things
found for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>), and would then scold them for looking. But when alone
he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) would be ever scolding himself because of the faults which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>)
thus committed. A conscientious, hard-working, friendly man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was,
but one difficult to deal with; hot in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temper, impatient of all
stupidities, impatient often of that which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrongly thought to be
stupidity, never owning himself to be wrong, anxious always for the
truth, but often missing to see it, a man who would fret grievously
for the merest trifle, and think nothing of the greatest success when
it had once been gained. Such a one was Mr. Quickenham; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was
a man of whom all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) enemies and most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) friends were a little
afraid. Mrs. Fenwick would declare herself to be much in awe of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>);
and our Vicar, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would not admit as much, was always a little
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) guard when the great barrister was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>).

<p/>How it had come to pass that Mr. Chamberlaine had not been called
upon to take a part in the Cathedral services during Passion
week cannot here be explained; but it was the fact, that when Mr.
Quickenham arrived at Bullhampton, the Canon was staying at The
Privets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) had come over there early in the week,--as it was
supposed by Mr. Fenwick with some hope of talking his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) nephew into a
more reasonable state of mind respecting Miss Lowther; but, according
to Mrs. Fenwick's uncharitable views, with the distinct object of
escaping the long church services of the Holy week,--and was to
return to Salisbury on the Saturday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was, therefore, invited to
meet Mr. Quickenham at dinner on the Thursday. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) own city and
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) own neighbours he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) would have thought it indiscreet to dine
out in Passion week; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) explained to Mr. Fenwick, these
things were very different in a rural parish.

<p/>Mr. Quickenham arrived an hour or two before dinner, and was
immediately taken out to see the obnoxious building; while Mrs.
Fenwick, who never would go to see it, described all its horrors to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) sister within the guarded precincts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own drawing-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It used to be a bit of common land, didn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Quickenham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know what is common land,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>replied the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``The children
used to play here, and when there was a bit of grass on it some of
the neighbours' cows would get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was never advertised--to be let on building lease?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear no! Lord Trowbridge never did anything of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say not.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) walked
round the plot of ground, pacing it, as though something might be
learned in that way. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) looked up at the building with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) hands
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) pockets, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) head on one side. <div class="bookquote">``Has there been a deed of
gift,--perhaps a peppercorn rent, or something of that kind?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div>The
Vicar declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was altogether ignorant of what had been done
between the agent for the Marquis and the trustees to whom had been
committed the building of the chapel. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Quickenham. <div class="bookquote">``They've been in such a hurry to punish you, that they've
gone on a mere verbal permission. What's the extent of the glebe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They call it forty-two acres.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever have it measured?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never. It would make no difference to me whether it is forty-one or
forty-three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's as may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer. <div class="bookquote">``It's as nasty a thing as I've
looked at for many a day, but it wouldn't do to call it a nuisance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. Janet is very hot about it; but, as for me, I've made
up my mind to swallow it. After all, what harm will it do me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an insult,--that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I can show that I don't take it as an insult, the insult will
be nothing. Of course the people know that their landlord is trying
to spite me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for awhile they'll spite me too, because he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) does. Of course it's
a bore. It cripples one's influence, and to a certain degree spreads
dissent at the cost of the Church. Men and women will go to that
place merely because Lord Trowbridge favours the building. I know all
that, and it irks me; but still it will be better to swallow it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's the oldest man in the parish?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Quickenham; <div class="bookquote">``the
oldest with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses still about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>The parson reflected for
awhile, and then said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) thought Brattle, the miller, was as
old a man as there was there, with the capability left to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of
remembering and of stating what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered. <div class="bookquote">``And what's his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
age,--about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Fenwick said that the miller was between sixty and
seventy, and had lived in Bullhampton all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) life. <div class="bookquote">``A church-going
man?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>asked the lawyer. To this the Vicar was obliged to reply that,
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) very great regret, old Brattle never entered a church. <div class="bookquote">``Then
I'll step over and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) during morning service to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said
the lawyer. The Vicar raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) eyebrows, but said nothing as to
the propriety of Mr. Quickenham's personal attendance at a place of
worship on Good Friday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can anything be done, Richard?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, appealing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
brother-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--undoubtedly something can be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can there, indeed? I am so glad. What can be done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can make the best of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what I'm determined I won't do. It's mean-spirited, and
so I tell Frank. I never would have hurt them as long as they treated
us well; but now they are enemies, and as enemies I will regard them.
I should think myself disgraced if I were to sit down in the presence
of the Marquis of Trowbridge; I should, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can easily manage that by standing up when you meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Quickenham. Mr. Quickenham could be very funny at times, but
those who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) would remark that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was funny he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) had
something to hide. His (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) wife as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) wit was quite sure that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) had some plan in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) head about the chapel.

<p/>At half-past six there came Mr. Chamberlaine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) nephew. The
conversation about the chapel was still continued, and the canon from
Salisbury was very eloquent, and learned also, upon the subject. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>)
eloquence was brightest while the ladies were still in the room,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) learning was brought forth most manifestly after they had
retired. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was very clear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) opinion that the Marquis had the
law on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) side in giving the land for the purpose in question, even
if it could be shown that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was simply the lord of the manor, and
not so possessed of the spot as to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) liked in it for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own
purposes. Mr. Chamberlaine expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) opinion that, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>)
himself might think otherwise, it would be held to be for the benefit
of the community that the chapel should be built, and in no court
could an injunction against the building be obtained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) couldn't give leave to have it put on another man's ground,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen's Counsel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no question of another man's ground here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the member</b></font>)</div>said the member
of the Chapter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not so sure of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Quickenham. <div class="bookquote">``It may not
be the ground of any one man, but if it's the ground of any ten or
twenty it's the same thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then there would be a lawsuit,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It might come to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen's Counsel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you wouldn't have a leg to stand upon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the member</b></font>)</div>said the member of
the Chapter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore. <div class="bookquote">``If the land is common to
the parish, the Marquis of Trowbridge cannot give it to a part of the
parishioners because he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) is Lord of the Manor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For such a purpose I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chamberlaine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Quickenham. <div class="bookquote">``All the same, it
may be very difficult to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hasn't the right; and in the
meantime there stands the chapel, a fact accomplished. If the ground
had been bought and the purchasers had wanted a title, I think it
probable the Marquis would never have got his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no doubt that it is very ungentlemanlike,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Chamberlaine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There I'm afraid I can't help you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Quickenham. <div class="bookquote">``Good law
is not defined very clearly here in England; but good manners have
never been defined at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want anyone to help me on such a matter as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Chamberlaine, who did not altogether like Mr. Quickenham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Quickenham; <div class="bookquote">``and yet the question may be
open to argument. A man may do what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, and can
hardly be called ungentlemanlike because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gives it away to a person
you don't happen to like.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``I dare say not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Quickenham.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what we all think about it in Salisbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Chamberlaine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just possible that you may be a little hypercritical in
Salisbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>said Quickenham.

<p/>There was nothing else discussed and nothing else thought of in
the Vicarage. The first of June had been the day now fixed for the
opening of the new chapel, and here they were already in April. Mr.
Fenwick was quite of opinion that if the services of Mr. Puddleham's
congregation were once commenced in the building they must
be continued there. As long as the thing was a thing not yet
accomplished it might be practicable to stop it; but there could be
no stopping it when the full tide of Methodist eloquence should have
begun to pour itself from the new pulpit. It would then have been
made the House of God,--even though not consecrated,--and as such
it must remain. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was becoming sick of the grievance, and
wished that it was over. As to going to law with the Marquis on a
question of Common-right, it was a thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would not think
of doing. The living had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) college, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had
thought it right to let the Bursar of Saint John's know what was
being done; but it was quite clear that the college could not
interfere or spend their money on a matter which, though it was
parochial, had no reference to their property in the parish. It was
not for the college, as patron of the living, to inquire whether
certain lands belonged to the Marquis of Trowbridge or to the parish
at large, though the Vicar no doubt, as one of the inhabitants of the
place, might raise the question at law if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) chose to find the money
and could find the ground on which to raise it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) old friend the
Bursar wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) back a joking letter, recommending him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) to put more
fire into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) sermons and thus to preach his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) enemy down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have become so sick of this chapel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>the Vicar said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife
that night, <div class="bookquote">``that I wish the subject might never be mentioned again
in the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't be more sick of it than I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I mean is, that I'm sick of it as a subject of conversation.
There it is, and let us make the best of it, as Quickenham says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't expect anything like sympathy from Richard, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want any sympathy. I want simply silence. If you'll only
make up your mind to take it for granted, and to put up with it--as
you had to do with the frost when the shrubs were killed, or with
anything that is disagreeable but unavoidable, the feeling of
unhappiness about it would die away at once. One does not grieve at
the inevitable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But one must be quite sure that it is inevitable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There it stands, and nothing that we can do can stop it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is sure Richard has got something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
head. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) will not sympathise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) will think and contrive and
fight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And half ruin us by his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) fighting,''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the husband. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) fancies the
land may be common land, and not private property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then of course the chapel has no right to be there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But who is to have it removed? And if I could succeed in doing so,
what would be said to me for putting down a place of worship after
such a fashion as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who could say anything against you, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth is, it is Lord Trowbridge who is my enemy here, and not
the chapel or Mr. Puddleham. I'd have given the spot for the chapel,
had they wanted it, and had I had the power to give it. I'm annoyed
because Lord Trowbridge should know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) had got the better of
me. If I can only bring myself to feel,--and you too,--that there is
no better in it, and no worse, I shall be annoyed no longer. Lord
Trowbridge cannot really touch me; and could he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>), I do not know that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) suddenly had the power to turn me out of the
living I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)'d do it,--any more than I would him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) estate. Men indulge in little injuries who can't afford to be
wicked enough for great injustice. My dear, you will do me a great
favour,--the greatest possible kindness,--if you'll give up all
outer, and, as far as possible, all inner hostility to the chapel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Frank!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask it as a great favour,--for my peace of mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's my darling! It shan't make me unhappy any longer. What!--a
stupid lot of bricks and mortar, that, after all, are intended for a
good purpose,--to think that I should become a miserable wretch just
because this good purpose is carried on outside my own gate. Were it
in my dining-room, I ought to bear it without misery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will strive to forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife. And on the next morning,
which was Good Friday, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) walked to church, round by the outside
gate, in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might give proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) intention to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
promise to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband walked before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
went she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked round at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sister and shuddered and turned up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
nose. But this was involuntary.

<p/>In the mean time Mr. Quickenham was getting himself ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>)
walk to the mill. Any such investigation as this which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) had on hand
was much more compatible with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) idea of a holiday than attendance
for two hours at the Church Service. On Easter Sunday he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) would make
the sacrifice,--unless a headache, or pressing letters from London,
or Apollo in some other beneficent shape, might interfere and save
him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) from the necessity. Mr. Quickenham, when at home, would go to
church as seldom as was possible, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) might save himself from
being put down as one who neglected public worship. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was
about equal to Mr. George Brattle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) religious zeal. Mr. George
Brattle made a clear compromise with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) own conscience. One good
Sunday against a Sunday that was not good left him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) thought,
properly poised in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) intended condition of human infirmity. It may
be doubted whether Mr. Quickenham's mind was equally philosophic on
the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) could hardly tell why he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) went to church, or why he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>)
stayed away. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was aware when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) went of the presence of some
unsatisfactory feelings of imposture on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) own part, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was
equally alive, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) did not go, to a sting of conscience in that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was neglecting a duty. But George Brattle had arranged it all in a
manner that was perfectly satisfactory to himself.

<p/>Mr. Quickenham had inquired the way, and took the path to the mill
along the river. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) walked rapidly, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) nose in the air, as
though it was a manifest duty, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) found himself in the
country, to get over as much ground as possible, and to refresh his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>)
lungs thoroughly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) did not look much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) went at the running
river, or at the opening buds on the trees and hedges. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) met
a rustic loitering on the path, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) examined the man unconsciously,
and could afterwards have described, with tolerable accuracy, how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was dressed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) had smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) had observed the amatory
pleasantness of a young couple, who had not thought it at all
necessary to increase the distance between them because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>)
presence. These things he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) had seen, but the stream, and the hedges,
and the twittering of the birds, were as nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>).

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) went he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) met old Mrs. Brattle making her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) weary way to church. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>)
had not known Mrs. Brattle, and did not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) had felt
quite sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was the miller's wife. Standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) hands in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) pockets on the bridge which divided the house from the mill, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) mouth, was old Brattle, engaged for the moment in
saying some word to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) daughter, Fanny, who was behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
retreated as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw the stranger, and the miller stood his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
ground, waiting to be accosted, suspicion keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) hands deep
down in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) pockets, as though resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) would not be tempted
to put them forth for the purpose of any friendly greeting. The
lawyer saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) by name, and then the miller touched his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) hat,
thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) hand back into his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) pocket as soon as the ceremony
was accomplished. Mr. Quickenham explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) had come from
the Vicarage, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was brother-in-law to Mr. Fenwick, and a
lawyer,--at each of which statements old Brattle made a slight
projecting motion with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) chin, as being a mode of accepting the
information slightly better than absolute discourtesy. At the present
moment Mr. Fenwick was out of favour with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was not
disposed to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) heart to visitors from the Vicarage. Then Mr.
Quickenham plunged at once into the affair of the day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that chapel they are building, Mr. Brattle, just opposite
to the parson's gate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brattle/Mr. George Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brattle replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had heard of the chapel, but had never,
as yet, been up to see it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed; but you remember the bit of ground?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes;--the miller remembered the ground very well. Man and boy he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) had
known it for sixty years. As far as his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) mind went he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) thought it a
very good thing that the piece of ground should be put to some useful
purpose at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure but what you may be right there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not been of use,--not to nobody,--for more than forty year,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And before that what did they do with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Parson, as we had then in Bull`umpton, kep' a few sheep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--just so. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) would get a bit of feeding off the ground?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
miller nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Was that the Vicar just before Mr. Fenwick?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>asked the lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not by no means. There was Muster Brandon, who never come here at
all, but had a curate who lived away to Hinton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hinton</b></font>) come after Parson
Smallbones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was Parson Smallbones who kept the sheep?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then there was Muster Threepaway, who was parson well nigh
thirty years afore Muster Fenwick come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) died up at Parsonage
House, did Muster Threepaway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) didn't keep sheep?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) kep' no sheep as ever I heard tell on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) didn't keep much
barring hisself,--didn't Muster Threepaway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Threepaway</b></font>) had never no child,
nor yet no wife, nor nothing at all, hadn't Muster Threepaway. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Threepaway</b></font>)
was a good man as didn't go meddling with folk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Parson Smallbones was a bit of a farmer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay. Parsons in them days warn't above a bit of farming. I warn't
much more than a scrap of a boy, but I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wore a wig,
and old black gaiters; and knew as well what was his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'n and what
wasn't as any parson in Wiltshire. Tithes was tithes then; and parson
was cute enough in taking on 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But these sheep of his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) were his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) own, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose else would they be, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) fence them in on that bit of ground?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There'd be a boy with 'em, I'm thinking, sir. There wasn't so much
fencing of sheep then as there be now. Boys was cheaper in them
days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so; and the parson wouldn't allow other sheep there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Muster Smallbones mostly took all he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) could get, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. The parsons generally did, I believe. It was the way in
which they followed most accurately the excellent examples set them
by the bishops. But, Mr. Brattle, it wasn't in the way of tithes that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had this grass for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) sheep?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say how he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had it, nor yet how Muster Fenwick has the
meadows t`other side of the river, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) lets to farmer Pierce;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) do have 'em, and farmer Pierce do pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) the rent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glebe land, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Quickenham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what they calls it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And none of the vicars that came after old Smallbones have ever done
anything with that bit of ground?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ne'er a one on'em. Mr. Brandon, as I tell `ee, never come nigh the
place. I don't know as ever I see'd him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). It was him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) as they made
bishop afterwards, some'eres away in Ireland. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had a lord to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
uncle. Then Muster Threepaway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Threepaway</b></font>) was here ever so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Threepaway</b></font>) didn't mind such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Threepaway</b></font>) never owned no sheep; and the old `oomen's cows was let to go on
the land, as was best, and then the boys took to playing hopskotch
there, with a horse or two over it at times, and now Mr. Puddleham
has it for his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) preaching. Maybe, sir, the lawyers might have a turn
at it yet;''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>and the miller laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) own wit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And get more out of it than any former occupant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Quickenham/MR. QUICKENHAM/Quickenham</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Quickenham, who would indeed have been very loth to allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) wife's
brother-in-law to go into a law suit, but still felt that a very
pretty piece of litigation was about to be thrown away in this matter
of Mr. Puddleham's chapel.

<p/>Mr. Quickenham bade farewell to the miller, and thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) saw
a way to a case. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) was a man very strongly given to accuracy,
and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) return to the Vicarage said no word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) conversation
with the miller. It would have been natural that Fenwick should
have interrogated him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) morning's work; but the Vicar had
determined to trouble himself no further about his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) grievance, to
say nothing further respecting it to any man, not even to allow the
remembrance of Mr. Puddleham and his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) chapel to dwell in his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) mind; and
consequently held his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) peace. Mrs. Fenwick was curious enough on the
subject, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had made a promise to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband, and would at
least endeavour to keep it. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) sister should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) anything
unasked, that would not be her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) fault.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIII.

<p/>EASTER AT TURNOVER CASTLE.


<p/>It was not only at Bullhampton that this affair of the Methodist
chapel demanded and received attention. At Turnover also a good deal
was being said about it, and the mind of the Marquis was not easy. As
has been already told, the bishop had written to him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) on the subject,
remonstrating with him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) as to the injury he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was doing to the present
vicar, and to future vicars, of the parish which he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), as landlord,
was bound to treat with beneficent consideration. The Marquis had
replied to the bishop with a tone of stern resolve. The Vicar of
Bullhampton had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) with scorn, nay, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) thought, with most
unpardonable insolence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would not spare the Vicar. It was
proper that the dissenters at Bullhampton should have a chapel, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had a right to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) liked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own. So arguing with
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had written to the bishop very firmly; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own mind
had not been firm within him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) did so. There were misgivings
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was a Churchman himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was pricked with
remorse as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was spiting the Church which was
connected with the state, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was so eminent a supporter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
own chief agent, too, had hesitated, and had suggested that perhaps
the matter might be postponed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) august daughters, though they
had learned to hold the name of Fenwick in proper abhorrence,
nevertheless were grieved about the chapel. Men and women were
talking about it, and the words of the common people found their way
to the august daughters of the house of Stowte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carolina; <div class="bookquote">``wouldn't it, perhaps, be better to build
the Bullhampton chapel a little farther off from the Vicarage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The next vicar might be a different sort of person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophie/Lady Sophie</b></font>)</div>said the Lady
Sophie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it wouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Earl</b></font>)</div>said the Earl, who was apt to be very imperious
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) own daughters, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) was of opinion that they should
be held in great awe by all the world--excepting only himself and
their eldest brother.

<p/>That eldest brother, Lord Saint George, was in truth regarded at
Turnover as being, of all persons in the world, the most august.
The Marquis himself was afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son, and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) in extreme
veneration. To the mind of the Marquis the heir expectant of all the
dignities of the House of Stowte was almost a greater man than the
owner of them; and this feeling came not only from a consciousness
on the part of the father that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son was a bigger man than himself,
cleverer, better versed in the affairs of the world, and more thought
of by those around them, but also to a certain extent from an idea
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) who would have all these grand things thirty or perhaps even
fifty years hence, must be more powerful than one with whom their
possession would come to an end probably after the lapse of eight
or ten years. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heir was to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) almost divine. When things at
the castle were in any way uncomfortable, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could put up with the
discomfort for himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughters; but it was not to be
endured that Saint George should be incommoded. Old carriage-horses
must be changed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) were coming; the glazing of the new greenhouse
must be got out of the way, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) should smell the paint; the game
must not be touched till he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) should come to shoot it. And yet Lord
Saint George himself was a man who never gave himself any airs; and
who in his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) personal intercourse with the world around him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) demanded
much less acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) magnificence than did his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) father.

<p/>And now, during this Easter week, Lord Saint George came down to
the castle, intending to kill two birds with one stone, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>)
parliamentary holiday, and to do a little business with his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) father.
It not unfrequently came to pass that he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) found it necessary to
repress the energy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) father's august magnificence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) would go
so far as to remind his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) father that in these days marquises were not
very different from other people, except in this, that they perhaps
might have more money. The Marquis would fret in silence, not daring
to commit himself to an argument with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son, and would in secret
lament over the altered ideas of the age. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) theory of
politics that the old distances should be maintained, and that the
head of a great family should be a patriarch, entitled to obedience
from those around him (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>). It was his (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) son's idea that every man was
entitled to as much obedience as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money would buy, and to no more.
This was very lamentable to the Marquis; but nevertheless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son
was the coming man, and even this must be borne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry about this chapel at Bullhampton,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son to the
father after dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why sorry, Saint George? I thought you would have been of opinion
that the dissenters should have a chapel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly they should, if they're fools enough to want to build
a place to pray in, when they have got one already built for them.
There's no reason on earth why they shouldn't have a chapel, seeing
that nothing that we can do will save them from schism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't prevent dissent, Saint George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't prevent it, because, in religion as in everything else, men
like to manage themselves. This farmer or that tradesman becomes a
dissenter because he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) can be somebody in the management of his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) chapel,
and would be nobody in regard to the parish church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very dreadful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not worse than our own people, who remain with us because it sounds
the most respectable. Not one in fifty really believes that this or
that form of worship is more likely to send him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) to heaven than any
other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly claim to myself to be one of the few,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt; and so you ought, my lord, as every advantage has been
given you. But, to come back to the Bullhampton chapel,--don't you
think we could move it away from the parson's gate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have built it now, Saint George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They can't have finished it yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't have me ask them to pull it down? Packer was here
yesterday, and said that the framework of the roof was up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What made them hurry it in that way? Spite against the Vicar, I
suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) is a most objectionable man, Saint George; most insolent,
overbearing, and unlike a clergyman. They say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) is little
better than an infidel himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We had better leave that to the bishop, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must feel about it, connected as we are with the parish,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said
the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't think we shall do any good by going into a parochial
quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was the very best bit of land for the purpose in all
Bullhampton,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis. <div class="bookquote">``I made particular inquiry, and there
can be no doubt of that. Though I particularly dislike that Mr.
Fenwick, it was not done to injure him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does injure him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) damnably, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's only an accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm not at all sure that we shan't find that we have made a
mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How a mistake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we have given away land that doesn't belong to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who says it doesn't belong to us?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, angrily. A
suggestion so hostile, so unjust, so cruel as this, almost overcame
the feeling of veneration which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) entertained for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``That is
really nonsense, Saint George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you looked at the title deeds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The title deeds are of course with Mr. Boothby. But Packer knows
every foot of the ground,--even if I didn't know it myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't give a straw for Packer's knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't heard that they have even raised the question themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm told that they will do so,--that they say it is common land.
It's quite clear that it has never been either let or enclosed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might say the same of the bit of green that lies outside the
park gate,--where the great oak stands; but I don't suppose that that
is common.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say that this is--but I do say that there may be difficulty
of proof; and that to be driven to the proof in such a matter would
be disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you do, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take the bull by the horns, and move the chapel at our own expense
to some site that shall be altogether unobjectionable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We should be owning ourselves wrong, Augustus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not? I cannot see what disgrace there is in coming forward
handsomely and telling the truth. When the land was given we thought
it was our own. There has come up a shadow of a doubt, and sooner
than be in the wrong, we give another site and take all the expense.
I think that would be the right sort of thing to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Saint George returned to town two days afterwards, and the
Marquis was left with the dilemma on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) mind. Lord Saint George,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) would frequently interfere in matters connected with the
property in the manner described, would never dictate and seldom
insist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) had said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) had got to say, and the Marquis was left
to act for himself. But the old lord had learned to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was
sure to fall into some pit whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) declined to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) son's
advice. His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) son had a painful way of being right that was a great
trouble to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). And this was a question which touched him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) very
nearly. It was not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) must yield to Mr. Fenwick before the
eyes of Mr. Puddleham and all the people of Bullhampton; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
must confess his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) own ignorance as to the borders of his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) own property,
and must abandon a bit of land which he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) believed to belong to the
Stowte estate. Now, if there was a point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) religion as to which
Lord Trowbridge was more staunch than another, it was as to the
removal of landmarks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) did not covet his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) neighbour's land; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
was most resolute that no stranger should, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) reign, ever
possess a rood of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) own.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIV.

<p/>THE MARRABLES OF DUNRIPPLE.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were to go, there would be nobody left but you. You should
remember that, Walter, when you talk of going to India.''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div>This was
said to Walter Marrable at Dunripple, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) cousin Gregory, Sir
Gregory's only son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I were to die in India, as I probably shall, who will come
next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nobody to come next for the title.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But for the property?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As it stands at present, if you and I were to die before your father
and uncle John, the survivor of them would be the last in the entail.
If they, too, died, and the survivor of us all left no will, the
property would go to Mary Lowther. But that is hardly probable. When
my grandfather made the settlement, on my father's marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
four sons living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should my father have the handling of it I would not give much for
anybody's chance after him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div>said Walter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were to marry there would, of course, be a new settlement
as to your rights. Your father could do no harm except as your
heir,--unless, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were heir to us all. My uncle John will
outlive him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), probably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My uncle John will live for ever, I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div>said Walter
Marrable.

<p/>This conversation took place between the two cousins when Walter
had been already two or three weeks at Dunripple. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had come there
intending to stay over two or three days, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had already accepted
an invitation to make the house his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) home as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) should remain
in England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had known but little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) uncle and nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
cousin, before this visit was made. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had conceived them to be
unfriendly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), having known them to be always unfriendly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was, of course, aware,--very well aware now, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had
himself suffered so grievously from his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) father's dishonesty,--that
the enmity which had reached them from Dunripple had been well
deserved. Colonel Marrable had, as a younger brother, never been
content with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was able to extract from the head of the family,
who was, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) eyes, a milch cow that never ought to run dry. With
Walter Marrable there had remained a feeling adverse to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle and
cousin, even after he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had been forced to admit to himself how many
and how grievous were the sins of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had believed
that the Dunripple people were stupid, and prejudiced, and selfish;
and it had only been at the instance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle, the parson, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had consented to make the visit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had gone there, and had been
treated, at any rate, with affectionate consideration. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had
found the house to be not unpleasant, though very quiet. Living at
Dunripple there was a Mrs. Brownlow, a widowed sister of the late
Lady Marrable, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) daughter, Edith Brownlow. Previous to this
time Walter Marrable had never even heard of the Brownlows, so little
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) known about Dunripple; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) arrived there it had been
necessary to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) who these people were.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had found his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle, Sir Gregory, to be much such a man as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had
expected in outward appearance and mode of life. The baronet was old
and disposed to regard himself as entitled to all the indulgences
of infirmity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) rose late, took but little exercise, was very
particular about what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) ate, and got through his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) day with the
assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) steward, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) novel, and occasionally of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) doctor.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) slept a great deal, and was never tired of talking of himself.
Occupation in life he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had none, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was a charitable, honourable
man, who had high ideas of what was due to others. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) son, however,
had astonished Walter considerably. Gregory Marrable the younger
was a man somewhat over forty, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) were
sixty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was very tall and thin, narrow in the chest, and so round
in the shoulders as to appear to be almost humpbacked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was so
short-sighted as to be nearly blind, and was quite bald. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) carried
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) head so forward that it looked as though it were going to fall
off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) shambled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) legs, which seemed never to be strong
enough to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) from one room to another; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) tried them by no
other exercise, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) never went outside the house except when, on
Sundays and some other very rare occasions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would trust himself to
be driven in a low pony-phaeton. But in one respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was altogether
unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) father. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) whole time was spent among his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) books, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
was at this moment engaged in revising and editing a very long and
altogether unreadable old English chronicle in rhyme, for publication
by one of those learned societies which are rife in London. Of Robert
of Gloucester, and William Langland, of Andrew of Wyntown and the
Lady Juliana Berners, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) could discourse, if not with eloquence, at
least with enthusiasm. Chaucer was his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) favourite poet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) was
supposed to have read the works of Gower in English, French, and
Latin. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) was himself apparently as old as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) own
black-letter volumes, and as unfit for general use. Walter could
hardly regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) as a cousin, declaring to himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) uncle
the parson, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own father were, in effect, younger men than the
younger Gregory Marrable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was never without a cough, never well,
never without various ailments and troubles of the flesh,--of which,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) himself made but slight account, taking them quite as a
matter of course. With such inmates the house no doubt would have
been dull, had there not been women there to enliven it.

<p/>By degrees, too, and not by slow degrees, the new comer found that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was treated as one of the family,--found that, after a certain
fashion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was treated as the heir to the family. Between him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) and
the title and the estate there were but the lives of four old men.
Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) not known that this was so before he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had allowed himself
to be separated from Mary Lowther? But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had known nothing of
it,--had thought not at all about it. There had been another
Marrable, of the same generation with himself, between him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) and
the succession, who might marry and have children, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had not
regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) heirship as being likely to have any effect, at any rate
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) early life. It had never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) need not go
to India, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would probably outlive four old gentlemen and
become Sir Walter Marrable and owner of Dunripple.

<p/>Nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) have looked at the matter in that light now had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
cousin forced the matter upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). Not a word was said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) at
Dunripple about Mary Lowther, but very many words were said about his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
own condition. Gregory Marrable strongly advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) against going to
India,--so strongly that Walter was surprised to find that such a man
would have so much to say on such a subject. The young captain, in
such circumstances, could not very well explain that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was driven
to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) profession in a fashion so disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) because,
although he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was heir to Dunripple, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was not near enough to it to be
entitled to any allowance from its owner; but he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) felt that that would
have been the only true answer when it was proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to stay
in England because he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) would some day become Sir Walter Marrable. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did plead the great loss which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had encountered by means of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
father's ill-treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), and endeavoured to prove to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) cousin
that there was no alternative before him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) but to serve in some quarter
of the globe in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) pay would be sufficient for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you not sell out, or go on half-pay, and remain here and
marry Edith Brownlow?''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) cousin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I could do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div>said Walter, slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? There is nothing my father would like so much.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
was silent for awhile, but, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) cousin made no further immediate
reply, Gregory Marrable went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) plan. <div class="bookquote">``Ten years ago, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was not much more than a little girl, and when it was first
arranged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) should come here, my father proposed--that I should
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why didn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>The elder cousin smiled and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) head, and coughed aloud as
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Why not, indeed? Well; I suppose you can see why not.
I was an old man almost before she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was a young woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is just
twenty-four now, and I shall be dead, probably, in two years' time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twice since that time I have been within an inch of dying. At any
rate, even my father does not look to that any longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fond of Miss Brownlow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no one in the world whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loves so well. Of course an old
man loves a young woman best. It is natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
never had a daughter; but Edith is the same to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own child.
Nothing would please him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so much as that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) should be the mistress
of Dunripple.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid that it cannot be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div>said Walter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not? There need be no India for you then. If you would do
that you would be to my father exactly as though you were his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son.
Your father might, of course, outlive my father, and no doubt will
outlive me, and then for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will have the place, but some
arrangement could be made so that you should continue here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it cannot be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div>said Walter. Many thoughts were passing
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) mind. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) not known that these good things were so
near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had allowed Mary Lowther to go off from him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)?
And, had it chanced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had visited Dunripple before he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had gone
to Loring, how might it have been between him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) and this other girl?
Edith Brownlow was not beautiful, not grand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) beauty as was
Mary Lowther; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was pretty, soft, lady-like, with a sweet dash
of quiet pleasant humour,--a girl who certainly need not be left
begging about the world for a husband. And this life at Dunripple was
pleasant enough. Though the two elder Marrables were old and infirm,
Walter was allowed to do just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) pleased in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was
encouraged to hunt. There was shooting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) wished it. Even
the servants about the place, the gamekeeper, the groom, and the old
butler, seemed to have recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) as the heir. There would have
been so comfortable an escape from the dilemma into which his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) father
had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>),--had he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) not made his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) visit to Loring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregory/Gregory Marrable/GREGORY MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>demanded Gregory Marrable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man cannot become attached to a girl by order, and what right have
I to suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would accept me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would accept you. Why not? Everybody around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would
be in your favour. And as to not falling in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), I declare
I do not know a sweeter human being in the world than Edith
Brownlow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Before the hunting season was over Captain Marrable had abandoned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) intention of going to India, and had made arrangements for
serving for awhile with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) regiment in England. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did after a
discussion of some length with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle, Sir Gregory. During that
discussion nothing was said about Edith Brownlow, and of course, not
a word was said about Mary Lowther. Captain Marrable did not even
know whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle or his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) cousin was aware that that engagement
had ever existed. Between him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle there had never been an
allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) marriage, but the old man had spoken of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nearness
to the property, and had expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regret that the last heir,
the only heir likely to perpetuate the name and title, should take
himself to India in the pride of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made no offer as to
money, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nephew that there was a home for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would give up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) profession, or a retreat whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) professional
duties might allow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to visit it. Horses should be kept for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be treated in every way as a son of the family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take my father at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregory/Gregory Marrable/GREGORY MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Gregory Marrable. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will never
let you be short of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div><p/>After much consideration Walter Marrable did take Sir Gregory at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
word, and abandoned for ever all idea of a further career in India.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had done this he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wrote to Mary Lowther to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) decision. <div class="bookquote">``It does seem hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) letter, <div class="bookquote">``that an
arrangement which is in so many respects desirable, should not have
been compatible with one which is so much more desirable.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
made no renewed offer. Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could not do so at the
present moment, in honesty either to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) cousin or to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had accepted their hospitality and acceded to the arrangements
which they had proposed without any word on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) part of such
intention. A home had been offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) at Dunripple,--to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) present condition, but certainly not a home to any wife whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) might bring there, nor a home to the family which might come
afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was doing the best that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could with
himself by remaining in England, and the best also towards a possible
future renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) engagement with Mary Lowther. But of that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
said nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) merely told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) the fact as it
regarded himself, and told that somewhat coldly. Of Edith Brownlow,
and of the proposition in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) said nothing.

<p/>It was the intention both of Sir Gregory and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) son that the new
inmate of the house should marry Edith. The old man, who, up to a
late date had with weak persistency urged the match upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son,
had taken up the idea from the very first arrival of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nephew
at Dunripple. Such an arrangement would solve all the family
difficulties, and would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to provide for Edith as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>)
were indeed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved Edith dearly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not
bear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) should leave Dunripple, and it had grieved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sorely
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reflected that in coming years Dunripple must belong to
relatives of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew nothing that was good, and that Edith
Brownlow must be banished from the house. If his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son would have
married Edith, all might have been well, but even Sir Gregory was at
last aware that no such marriage as that could take place. Then had
come the quarrel between the Colonel and the Captain, and the latter
had been taken into favour. Colonel Marrable would not have been
allowed to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) foot inside Dunripple House, so great was the
horror which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had created. And the son had been feared too as long
as the father and son were one. But now the father, who had treated
the whole family vilely, had treated his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own son most vilely, and
therefore the son had been received with open arms. If only he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could
be trusted with Edith,--and if Edith and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might be made to trust
each other,--all might be well. Of the engagement between Walter and
Mary Lowther no word had ever reached Dunripple. Twice or thrice
in the year a letter would pass between Parson John and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nephew,
Gregory Marrable, but such letters were very short, and the parson
was the last man in the world to spread the tittle-tattle of a
love-story. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had always known that that affair would lead to
nothing, and that the less said about it the better.

<p/>Walter Marrable was to join his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) regiment at Windsor before the end
of April. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wrote to Mary Lowther to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) plans he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
had only a fortnight longer for remaining in idleness at Dunripple.
The hunting was over, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) life was simply idle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) perceived, or
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) perceived, that all the inmates of the house, and
especially his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle, expected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would soon return to them,
and that they spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) work of soldiering as of a thing that
was temporary. Mrs. Brownlow, who was a quiet woman, very reticent,
and by no means inclined to interfere with things not belonging to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), had suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would soon be with them again, and the
housekeeper had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) to understand that his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) room was not to be
touched. And then, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) saw that Edith Brownlow
was specially left in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) way. If that were so it was necessary that
the eyes of some one of the Dunripple party should be opened to the
truth.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was walking home with Miss Brownlow across the park from church
one Sunday morning. Sir Gregory never went to church; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) age was
supposed to be too great, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) infirmities too many. Mrs. Brownlow
was in the pony carriage driving her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) nephew, and Walter Marrable was
alone with Edith. There had been some talk of cousinship,--of the
various relationships of the family, and the like,--and of the way
in which the Marrables were connected. They two, Walter and Edith,
were not cousins. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) was related to the family only by her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) aunt's
marriage, and yet, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) had always heard more of the
Marrables than of the Brownlows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never saw Mary Lowther?''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div>Walter asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I just know her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) name,--hardly more. The last time your uncle was
here,--Parson John, we were talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) out to be
wonderfully beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was as long ago as last summer,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain, reflecting
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) uncle's account had been given before he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) and Mary Lowther
had seen each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes;--ever so long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is wonderfully beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), then, Captain Marrable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) very well. In the first place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is my cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But ever so distant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not first cousins. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) mother was a daughter of General
Marrable, who was a brother of Sir Gregory's father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so hard to understand, is it not? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is wonderfully
beautiful, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is your cousin--in the first place. What is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) in the
second place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was not quite sure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) wished to tell the story or not.
The engagement was broken, and it might be a question whether, as
regarded Mary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had a right to tell it; and, then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) did
tell it, would not his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) reason for doing so be apparent? Was it not
palpable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was expected to marry this girl, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would
understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was explaining to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) did not intend to
carry out the general expectation of the family? And, then, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
sure that it might not be possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) at some future time to do
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was desired?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant to say that, as I was staying at Loring, of course I met her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
frequently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is living with a certain old Miss Marrable, whom you
will meet some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), but I don't suppose I ever shall meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). I
never go anywhere. I don't suppose there are such stay-at-home people
in the world as we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you get Sir Gregory to ask them here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Both he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) and my cousin are so afraid of having strange women in
the house; you know, we never have anybody here; your coming has
been quite an event. Old Mrs. Potter seems to think that an era of
dissipation is to be commenced because she (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) has been called upon to
open so many pots of jam to make pies for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I have been very troublesome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Awfully troublesome. You can't think of all that had to be said and
done about the stables! Do you have your oats bruised? Even I was
consulted about that. Most of the people in the parish are quite
disappointed because you don't go about in your full armour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it's too late now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I own I was a little disappointed myself when you came down to
dinner without a sword. You can have no idea in what a state of rural
simplicity we live here. Would you believe it?--for ten years I have
never seen the sea, and have never been into any town bigger than
Worcester,--unless Hereford be bigger. We did go once to the festival
at Hereford. We have not managed Gloucester yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've never seen London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not since I was twelve years old. Papa died when I was fourteen,
and I came here almost immediately afterwards. Fancy, ten years at
Dunripple! There is not a tree or a stone I don't know, and of course
not a face in the parish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very nice; but it was out of the question that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should
ever become his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) might explain this to
herself by letting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had within the last few months
become engaged to, and had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) engagement with, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) cousin,
Mary Lowther. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) could not do it. In the first
place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would understand more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) meant her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to understand if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) made the attempt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
guard, and would take it as an insult. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) could not bring
himself to talk about Mary Lowther, and to tell their joint secrets.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was discontented with himself and with Dunripple, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) repented
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had yielded in respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) Indian service. Everything had
gone wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) refused to accede to Mary's proposition
for a separation, and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) come to Dunripple as an engaged man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
might, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) thought, have reconciled his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) uncle,--or at least his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) Cousin
Gregory,--to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) marriage with Mary. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) did not see his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) way back
to that position now, having been entertained at his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) uncle's house as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) uncle's heir for so long a time without having mentioned it.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) went off to Windsor, sad at heart, having received from
Mary an answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) letter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) felt to be very cold, very
discreet, and very unsatisfactory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had merely expressed a fervent
wish that whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) went to India or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) remained in England,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) might be prosperous and happy. The writer evidently intended that
the correspondence should not be continued.




<p/>CHAPTER XLV.

<p/>WHAT SHALL I DO WITH MYSELF?


<p/>Parson John Marrable, though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) letters to
Dunripple about the doings of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nephew at Loring, was by no
means equally reticent in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) speech at Loring as to the doings at
Dunripple. How he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) came by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) news he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not say, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had ever so
much to tell. And Miss Marrable, who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) well, was aware that
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) news was not simple gossip, but was told with an object. In
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way, Parson John was a crafty man, who was always doing a turn
of business. To his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mind it was clearly inexpedient, and almost
impracticable, that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nephew and Mary Lowther should ever become
man and wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew that they were separated; but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew, also,
that they had agreed to separate on terms which would easily admit
of being reconsidered. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), too, had heard of Edith Brownlow, and had
heard that if a marriage could be arranged between Walter and Edith,
the family troubles would be in a fair way of settlement. No good
could come to anybody from that other marriage. As for Mary Lowther,
it was manifestly her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) duty to become Mrs. Gilmore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) therefore took
some trouble to let the ladies at Uphill know that Captain Marrable
had been received very graciously at Dunripple; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was making
himself very happy there, hunting, shooting, and forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) old
troubles; that it was understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was to be recognised as the
heir;--and that there was a young lady in the case, the favourite of
Sir Gregory.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) understood the world too well to say a word to Mary Lowther
herself about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) rival. Mary would have perceived his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) drift. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) ideas about Edith confidentially to Miss Marrable,
fully alive to the fact that Miss Marrable would know how to deal
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) niece. <div class="bookquote">``It is by far the best thing that could have happened
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson. <div class="bookquote">``As for going out to India again, for a man
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prospects it was very bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin isn't much older than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>suggested Miss
Marrable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is,--a great deal older. And Gregory's health is so bad that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) life is not worth a year's purchase. Poor fellow! they tell me he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>)
only cares to live till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) has got his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) book out. The truth is that
if Walter could make a match of it with Edith Brownlow, they might
arrange something about the property which would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) to live
there just as though the place were his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own. The Colonel would be the
only stumbling-block, and after what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could hardly
refuse to agree to anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'd have to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Marrable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) must be paid, that's all. My brother Gregory is wrapped up
in that girl, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) would do anything for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) welfare. I'm told that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and Walter have taken very kindly to each other already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>It would be better for Mary Lowther that Walter Marrable should marry
Edith Brownlow. Such, at least, was Miss Marrable's belief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could
see that Mary, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bore herself bravely, still did so as one
who had received a wound for which there was no remedy;--as a man
who has lost a leg and who nevertheless intends to enjoy life though
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never can walk again. But in this case, the real
bar to walking was the hope in Mary's breast,--a hope that was
still present, though it was not nourished,--that the leg was not
irremediably lost. If Captain Marrable would finish all that by
marrying Edith, then,--so thought Miss Marrable,--in process of time
the cure would be made good, and there might be another leg. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did
not believe much in the Captain's constancy, and was quite ready to
listen to the story about another love. And so from day to day words
were dropped into Mary's ear which had their effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say that I am glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) is not to go to India,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Marrable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, indeed, am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>answered Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the first place it is such an excellent thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) should be
on good terms at Dunripple. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) must inherit the property some day,
and the title too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>To this Mary made no reply. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) to have been hard that
the real state of things should not have been explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had then regarded any hope of relief
from Dunripple as being beyond measure distant. There had been a
possibility, and that was all,--a chance to which no prudent man or
woman would have looked in making their preparations for the life
before them. That had been her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) idea as to the Dunripple prospects;
and now it seemed that on a sudden Walter was to be regarded as
almost the immediate heir. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>); but it did appear
to be hard upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see the slightest reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) shouldn't live at
Dunripple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>continued Miss Marrable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would be dependent. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) does not mean to sell
out of the army altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) may be backwards and forwards. You see, there is no
chance of Sir Gregory's own son marrying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So they say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) position would be really that of a younger brother in
similar circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary paused a moment before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) replied, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Aunt Sarah, what does all this mean? I know you are speaking at
me, and yet I don't quite understand it. Everything between me and
Captain Marrable is over. I have no possible means of influencing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) life. If I were told to-morrow that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had given up the army and
taken to living altogether at Dunripple, I should have no means of
judging whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had done well or ill. Indeed, I should have no
right to judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be glad that the family should be united.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad. Now, is that all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to bring yourself to think without regret of his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) probable
marriage with this young lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't suppose I shall blame him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) marries her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I want you to see it in such a light that it shall not make you
unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, dear aunt, that we had better not talk of it. I can assure
you of this, that if I could prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) from marrying by holding up
my little finger, I would not do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be ten thousand pities,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>urged the old lady, <div class="bookquote">``that either
his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) life or yours should be a sacrifice to a little episode, which,
after all, only took a week or two in the acting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only answer for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to be a
sacrifice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>There were many such conversations, and by degrees they did have an
effect upon Mary Lowther. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) learned to believe that it was probable
that Captain Marrable should marry Miss Brownlow, and, of course,
asked herself questions as to the effect such a marriage would have
upon herself, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) answered more fully than she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) did those which
were put to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) aunt. Then there came to Parson John some
papers, which required his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) signature, in reference to the disposal
of a small sum of money, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) having been one of the trustees to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
brother's marriage settlement. This was needed in regard to some
provision which the baronet was making for his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) niece, and which, if
read aright, would rather have afforded evidence against than in
favour of the chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) immediate marriage; but it was taken
at Loring to signify that the thing was to be done, and that the
courtship was at any rate in progress. Mary did not believe all
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard; but there was left upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind an idea that
Walter Marrable was preparing himself for the sudden change of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
affections. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) determined that, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) do so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not
judge him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) to have done wrong. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could settle himself comfortably
in this way, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) not do so? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was told that Edith
Brownlow was pretty, and gentle, and good, and would undoubtedly
receive from Sir Gregory's hands all that Sir Gregory could give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>). It was expedient, for the sake of the whole family, that such
a marriage should be arranged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) would not stand in the way of
it; and, indeed, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) stand in the way of it? Had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
engagement with Captain Marrable been dissolved at her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) own instance
in the most solemn manner possible? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) marry whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) might, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
could have no ground of complaint on that score.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was in this state of mind when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) received Captain Marrable's
letter from Dunripple. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) opened it, for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) thought
that it would convey to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) tidings respecting Miss Brownlow. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had read it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) told herself how impossible it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
should have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) new matrimonial intentions, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
entertained them. The letter gave no evidence either one way or the
other; but it confirmed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) the news which had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) through
Parson John, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) former lover intended to abandon that special
career, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) choice of which had made it necessary that they two
should abandon their engagement. When at Loring he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had determined
that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) must go to India. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had found it to be impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
should live without going to India. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had now been staying a few
weeks at Dunripple with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) uncle, and with Edith Brownlow, and it
turned out that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) need not go to India at all. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) sat down,
and wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that guarded, civil, but unenthusiastic letter, of
which the reader has already heard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had allowed herself to be
wounded and made sore by what they had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) of Edith Brownlow.

<p/>It was still early in the spring, just in the middle of April, when
Mary received another letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend at Bullhampton, a letter
which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turn all these things in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind very seriously. If
Walter Marrable were to marry Edith Brownlow, what sort of future
life should she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), Mary Lowther, propose to herself? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was firmly
resolved upon one thing, that it behoved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to look rather to what
was right than to what might simply be pleasant. But would it be
right that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) should consider herself to be, as it were, widowed by
the frustration of an unfortunate passion? Life would still be left
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>),--such a life as that which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) aunt lived,--such a life, with
this exception, that whereas her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) aunt was a single lady with moderate
means, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would be a single lady with very small means indeed. But
that question of means did not go far with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>); there was something
so much more important that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could put that out of sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had
told herself very plainly that it was a good thing for a woman to be
married; that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would live and die unsuccessfully if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lived and
died a single woman; that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had desired to do better with herself
than that. Was it proper that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should now give up all such
ambition because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had made a mistake? If it were proper, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
do so; and then the question resolved itself into this;--Could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be
right if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) married a man without loving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? To marry a man without
esteeming him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), without the possibility of loving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hereafter, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
knew would be wrong.

<p/>Mrs. Fenwick's letter was as follows;--


<p/>Vicarage, Tuesday.

<p/>MY DEAR MARY,

<p/>My brother-in-law left us yesterday, and has put us all
into a twitter. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) said, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) was going away, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) didn't believe that Lord Trowbridge had any right to
give away the ground, because it had not been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
possession or his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) family's for a great many years, or
something of that sort. We don't clearly understand all
about it, nor does he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) is to find out something
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) can find out, and then let us know.
But in the middle of all this, Frank declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
won't stir in the matter, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could put the
abominable thing down by holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) finger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would
not do it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has made me promise not to talk about
it, and, therefore, all I can do is to be in a twitter.
If that spiteful old man has really given away land
that doesn't belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), simply to annoy us,--and it
certainly has been done with no other object,--I think
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be told of it. Frank, however, has got to
be quite serious about it, and you know how very serious
he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) can be when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is serious.

<p/>But I did not sit down to write specially about that
horrid chapel. I want to know what you mean to do in
the summer. It is always better to make these little
arrangements beforehand; and when I speak of the summer,
I mean the early summer. The long and the short of it is,
will you come to us about the end of May?

<p/>Of course, I know which way your thoughts will go when you
get this, and, of course, you will know what I am thinking
of when I write it; but I will promise that not a word
shall be said to you to urge you in any way. I do not
suppose you will think it right that you should stay away
from friends whom you love, and who love you dearly, for
fear of a man who wants you to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). You are not
afraid of Mr. Gilmore, and I don't suppose that you are
going to shut yourself up all your life because Captain
Marrable has not a fortune of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own. Come at any rate.
If you find it unpleasant you shall go back just when you
please, and I will pledge myself that you shall not be
harassed by persuasions.

<p/>Yours most affectionately,

<p/>JANET FENWICK.

<p/>Frank has read this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) says that all I have said about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) being serious is a tarradiddle; but that nothing can
be more true than what I have said about your friends
loving you, and wishing to have you here again. If you
were here we might talk him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) over yet about the chapel.


<p/>To which, in the Vicar's handwriting, was added the word, <div class="bookquote">``Never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>It was two days before she (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) showed this letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) aunt--two days
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) had thought much upon the subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) knew well that
her (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) aunt would counsel her (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) to go to Bullhampton, and, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>)
would not mention the letter till she (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) own mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) aunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go, if you do not object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly shall not object,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Marrable.

<p/>Then Mary wrote a very short letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend, which may as well,
also, be communicated to the reader:--


<p/>Loring, Thursday.

<p/>DEAR JANET,

<p/>I will go to you about the end of May; and yet, though I
have made up my mind to do so, I almost doubt that I am
not wise. If one could only ordain that things should
be as though they had never been! That, however, is
impossible, and one can only endeavour to live so as to
come as nearly as possible to such a state. I know that I
am confused; but I think you will understand what I mean.

<p/>I intend to be very full of energy about the chapel, and
I do hope that your brother-in-law will be able to prove
that Lord Trowbridge has been misbehaving himself. I never
loved Mr. Puddleham, who always seemed to look upon me
with wrath because I belonged to the Vicarage; and I
certainly should take delight in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) banished from
the Vicarage gate.

<p/>Always affectionately yours,

<p/>MARY LOWTHER.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVI.

<p/>MR. JAY OF WARMINSTER.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration-RSB-

<p/>The Vicar had undertaken to maintain Carry Brattle at Mrs. Stiggs's
house, in Trotter's Buildings, for a fortnight, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Trotter</b></font>) found at the
end of the fortnight that his (<font color='blue'><b>Trotter</b></font>) responsibility on the poor girl's
behalf was by no means over. The reader knows with what success
he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) visit to Startup, and how far he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was from ridding
himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) burden by the aid of the charity and affections of
the poor girl's relatives there. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had shaken the Startup dust, as
it were, from his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) gig-wheels as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) drove out of George Brattle's
farmyard, and had declined even the offer of money which had been
made. Ten or fifteen pounds! He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would make up the amount of that
offer out of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) own pocket rather than let the brother think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had bought off his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) duty to a sister at so cheap a rate. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
convinced himself that in this way he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) owed Carry Brattle fifteen
pounds, and comforted himself by reflecting that these fifteen pounds
would carry the girl on a good deal beyond the fortnight; if only she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
would submit herself to the tedium of such a life as would be hers
if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) remained at Mrs. Stiggs's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) named a fortnight both to
Carry and to Mrs. Stiggs, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) himself would either come or
send before the end of that time. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) returned home, and told the
whole story to his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) wife. All this took place before Mr. Quickenham's
arrival at the vicarage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Frank,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) wife to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you will get into trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of trouble?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the first place, the expense of maintaining this poor girl,--for
life, as far as we can see,--will fall upon you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What if it does? But, as a matter of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will earn her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bread
sooner or later. How am I to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) over? And what am I to do with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that is not the worst of it, Frank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what is the worst of it? Let us have it at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People will say that you, a clergyman and a married man, go to see a
pretty young woman at Salisbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You believe that people will say that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you should guard against it, for the sake of the parish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of people will say it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord Trowbridge, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) set.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On my honour, Janet, I think that you wrong Lord Trowbridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) is a
fool, and to a certain extent a vindictive fool; and I grant you that
he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has taken it into his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) silly old head to hate me unmercifully; but
I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to be a gentleman, and I do not think that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) would
condescend to spread a damnably malicious report of which he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) did not
believe a word himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) will believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? How? On what evidence? He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) couldn't believe it. Let a man be
ever such a fool, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) can't believe a thing without some reason.
I dislike Lord Trowbridge very much; and you might just as well
say that because I dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) I shall believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) is a hard
landlord. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) is not a hard landlord; and were he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) to stick dissenting
chapels all about the county, I should be a liar and a slanderer were
I to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then, you see, you are not a fool, Frank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This brought the conversation to an end. The Vicar was willing enough
to turn upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) heel and say nothing more on a matter as to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was by no means sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was in the right; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife felt
a certain amount of reluctance in urging any arguments upon such a
subject. Whatever Lord Trowbridge might say or think, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) Frank must
not be led to suppose that any unworthy suspicion troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own
mind. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was imprudent.

<p/>When the fortnight was near at an end, and nothing had been done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
went again over to Salisbury. It was quite true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had business
there, as a gentleman almost always does have business in the county
town where his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) banker lives, whence tradesmen supply him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) belongs to some club. And our Vicar, too, was a man fond of
seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bishop, and one who loved to move about in the precincts
of the cathedral, to shake hands with the dean, and to have a
little subrisive fling at Mr. Chamberlaine, or such another as Mr.
Chamberlaine, if the opportunity came in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) was by no means
indisposed to go into Salisbury in the ordinary course of things; and
on this occasion absolutely did see Mr. Chamberlaine, the dean, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>)
saddler, and the clerk at the Fire Insurance Office,--as well as Mrs.
Stiggs and Carry Brattle. If, therefore, anyone had said that on this
day he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) had gone into Salisbury simply to see Carry Brattle, such
person would have maligned him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) reduced the premium on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) Fire
Insurance by 5_s._ 6_d._ a year, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) engaged Mr. Chamberlaine to
meet Mr. Quickenham, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) borrowed from the dean an old book about
falconry; so that in fact the few minutes which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) spent at Mrs.
Stiggs's house were barely squeezed in among the various affairs of
business which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) had to transact at Salisbury.

<p/>All that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) could say to Carry Brattle was this,--that hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>)
had settled nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) must stay in Trotter's Buildings for another
week or so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) had been so busy, in consequence of the time of the
year, preparing for Easter and the like, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) had not been able
to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) had a plan; but would say nothing about it till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) had seen whether it could be carried out. When Carry murmured
something about the cost of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) living the Vicar boldly declared that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) need not fret herself about that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had money of hers in
hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would some day explain all about that, but not now. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
interrogated Mrs. Stiggs as to Carry's life. Mrs. Stiggs expressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) belief that Carry wouldn't stand it much longer. The hours had
been inexpressibly long, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had declared more than once that the
best thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) could do was to go out and kill herself. Nevertheless,
Mrs. Stiggs's report as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) conduct was favourable. Of Sam
Brattle, the Vicar, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) inquired, could learn nothing. Carry
declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had not heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) all
bruised and bleeding after his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) fight at the Three Honest Men.

<p/>The Vicar had told Carry Brattle that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had a plan,--but, in truth,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had no plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had an idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) might overcome the miller by
taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) daughter straight into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) house, and placing the two face
to face together; but it was one in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) himself put so little
trust, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could form no plan out of it. In the first place,
would he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) be justified in taking such a step? Mrs. George Brattle
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) that people knew what was good for them without being
dictated to by clergymen; and the rebuke had come home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was the last man in the world to adopt a system of sacerdotal
interference. <div class="bookquote">``I could do it so much better if I was not a
clergyman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would say to himself. And then, if old Brattle chose
to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) daughter out of the house, on such provocation as the
daughter had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), what was that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), Fenwick, whether priest
or layman? The old man knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was about, and had shown his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
determination very vigorously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try the ironmonger at Warminster,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it will be of no use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it will. Ironmongers are probably harder than millers
or farmers,--and farmers are very hard. That fellow, Jay, would not
even consent to be bail for Sam Brattle. But something must be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) should be put into a reformatory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be too late now. That should have been done at once. At any
rate, I'll go to Warminster. I want to call on old Dr. Dickleburg,
and I can do that at the same time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did go to Warminster. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did call on the Doctor, who was not at
home;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did call also upon Mr. Jay, who was at home.

<p/>With Mr. Jay himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) chance was naturally much less than it
would be with George Brattle. The ironmonger was connected with the
unfortunate young woman only by marriage; and what brother-in-law
would take such a sister-in-law to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) bosom? And of Mrs. Jay he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>)
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) was puritanical, stiff, and severe.
Mr. Jay he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) found in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) shop along with an apprentice, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) had no
difficulty in leading the master ironmonger along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) through
a vista of pots, grates and frying pans, into a small recess at the
back of the establishment, in which requests for prolonged credit
were usually made, and urgent appeals for speedy payment as often put
forth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Know the story of Caroline Brattle? Oh yes! I know it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jay</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Jay. <div class="bookquote">``We had to know it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) head, and
rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) hands together, and looked down upon the ground. There
was, however, a humility about the man, a confession on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part,
that in talking to an undoubted gentleman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking to a
superior being, which gave to Fenwick an authority which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had felt
himself to want in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) intercourse with the farmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure, Mr. Jay, you will agree with me in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) should be
saved if possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) soul, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the ironmonger</b></font>)</div>asked the ironmonger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) soul. But we must get at that by saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) in
this world first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jay</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jay was a slight man, of middle height, with very respectable
iron-grey hair that stood almost upright upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) head, but with a
poor, inexpressive, thin face below it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) was given to bowing a good
deal, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) hands together, smiling courteously, and to the
making of many civil little speeches; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) strength as a leading
man in Warminster lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) hair, and in the suit of orderly
well-brushed black clothes which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) wore on all occasions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) was,
too, a man fairly prosperous, who went always to church, paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>)
way, attended sedulously to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) business, and hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) bells, and
sold his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) pots in such a manner as not actually to drive his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) old
customers away by default of work. <div class="bookquote">``Jay is respectable, and I don't
like to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>men would say, when their wives declared that the
backs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) grates fell out, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) nails never would stand
hammering. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) prospered; but, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) owed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) prosperity
mainly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) hands, and smiled, and bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>)
head about, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) thought what answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) might best make. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) was
quite willing that poor Carry's soul should be saved. That would
naturally be Mr. Fenwick's affair. But as to saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) body, with
any co-operation from himself or Mrs. Jay,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not see his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) way at
all through such a job as that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) is a bad `un, Mr. Fenwick; I'm afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jay</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Jay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The thing is, whether we can't put our heads together and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>)
less bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) must live somewhere, Mr. Jay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether almost the best thing for 'em isn't to die,--of
course after they have repented, Mr. Fenwick. You see, sir, it is so
very low, and so shameful, and they do bring such disgrace on their
poor families. There isn't anything a young man can do that is nearly
so bad,--is there, Mr. Fenwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not at all sure of that, Mr. Jay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't you now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to defend Carry Brattle;--but if you will think how

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clever she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was, Mr. Fenwick;--and bright, too, as you call it.

let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) come to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),--for a month or so, just to try her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and live here!''  (<font color='red'><b>the ironmonger</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the ironmonger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I would suggest. Who is to give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the shelter of a
roof, if a sister will not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that Mrs. Jay would undertake that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ironmonger</b></font>)</div>said the
ironmonger, who had ceased to rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) hands and to bow, and whose
face had now become singularly long and lugubrious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't do any good, Mr. Fenwick;--it wouldn't indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ought to do good. May I try?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you ask me, Mr. Fenwick, I should say no; indeed I should. Mrs.
Jay isn't any way strong, and the bare mention of that disreputable
connexion produces a sickness internally;--it does, indeed, Mr.
Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will do nothing, then, to save from perdition the sister of your
own wife;--and will let your wife do nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Fenwick, don't be hard on me;--pray don't be hard on me. I
have been respectable, and have always had respectable people about
me. If my wife's family are turning wrong, isn't that bad enough on
me without your coming to say such things as this to me? Really, Mr.
Fenwick, if you'd think of it, you wouldn't be so hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may die in a ditch, then, for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, whose
feeling against the ironmonger was much stronger than it had been
against the farmer. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could say nothing further, so he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) turned
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) heel and marched down the length of the shop, while the
obsequious tradesman followed him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>),--again bowing and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>)
hands, and attending him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) carriage. The Vicar didn't speak
another word, or make any parting salutation to Mr. Jay. <div class="bookquote">``Their
hearts are like the nether millstone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) said to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>)
drove away, flogging his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) horse. <div class="bookquote">``Of what use are all the sermons?
Nothing touches them. Do unto others as you think they would do unto
you. That's their doctrine.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) went home he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) mind that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) would, as a last effort, carry out that scheme of taking Carry
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) to the mill;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) would do so, that is, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) could induce
Carry to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>). In the meantime, there was nothing left to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) but to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) with Mrs. Stiggs, and to pay ten shillings a
week for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) board and lodging. There was one point on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) could
not quite make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) mind;--whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) would or would not first
acquaint old Mrs. Brattle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) intention.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) had left home early, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jay</b></font>) wife had received
Mary Lowther's reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank/Frank Fenwick</b></font>)</div>asked Frank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) just says that and nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll be Mrs. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so, with all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I look upon it as tantamount to accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wouldn't come
unless she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind to take him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). You mark my words.
They'll be married before the chapel is finished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say it as if you thought she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) oughtn't to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I don't mean that. I was only thinking how quickly a woman may
recover from such a hurt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Frank, don't be ill-natured. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will be doing what all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friends
advise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were to die, your friends would advise you not to grieve; but
they would think you very unfeeling if you did not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to turn against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you say such things? Is it not better that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should
make the effort than lie there helpless and motionless, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
whole life away? Will it not be much better for Harry Gilmore?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)'ll go crazy if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) too. We can't tell what is going on inside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breast.
I believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is making a great effort because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thinks it is
right. You will be kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I will,--for Harry's sake--and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>But in truth the Vicar at this moment was not in a good humour.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was becoming almost tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) efforts to set other people
straight, so great were the difficulties that came in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) way. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
had driven into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had met Mr. Puddleham, standing in
the road just in front of the new chapel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) mind to
accept the chapel, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said a pleasant word to the minister.
Mr. Puddleham turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) nose, bowed very stiffly,
and then twisted himself round, without answering a word. How was
it possible for a man to live among such people in good humour and
Christian charity?

<p/>In the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife in the drawing-room
discussing all these troubles, when the maid came in to say that
Constable Toffy was at the door.

<p/>Constable Toffy was shown into his (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) study, and then the Vicar followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had not spoken to the constable now for some months,--not
since the time at which Sam had been liberated; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had not a
moment's doubt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was thus summoned, that something was to be
said as to the murder of Mr. Trumbull. The constable put his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) hand up
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) head, and sat down at the Vicar's invitation, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) began
to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Toffy?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got 'em at last, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Toffy/Mr. Toffy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Toffy, in a very low, soft
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Got whom;--the murderers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, Mr. Fenwick; all except Sam Brattle,--whom we want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who are the men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Them as we supposed all along,--Jack Burrows, as they call the
Grinder, and Lawrence Acorn as was along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>)'s a Birmingham
chap, is Acorn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>)'s know'd very well at Birmingham. And then, Mr.
Fenwick, there's Sam. That's all as seems to have been in it. We
shall want Sam, Mr. Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was one of the murderers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall want him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), Mr. Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you find the other men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They did get as far as San Francisco,--did the others. They haven't
had a bad game of it,--have they, Mr. Fenwick? They've had more than
seven months of a run. It was the 31st of August as Mr. Trumbull was
murdered, and here's the 15th of April, Mr. Fenwick. There ain't a
many runs as long as that. You'll have Sam Brattle for us all right,
no doubt, Mr. Fenwick?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div>The Vicar told the constable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would
see to it, and get Sam Brattle to come forward as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could.
<div class="bookquote">``I told you all through, Mr. Fenwick, as Sam was one of them as was
in it, but you wouldn't believe me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVII.

<p/>SAM BRATTLE IS WANTED.


<p/>The next week was one of considerable perturbation, trouble, and
excitement at Bullhampton, and in the neighbourhood of Warminster
and Heytesbury. It soon became known generally that Jack the Grinder
and Lawrence Acorn were in Salisbury gaol, and that Sam Brattle--was
wanted. The perturbation and excitement at Bullhampton were, of
course, greater than elsewhere. It was necessary that the old miller
should be told,--necessary also that the people at the mill should be
asked as to Sam's present whereabouts. If they did not know it, they
might assist the Vicar in discovering it. Fenwick went to the mill,
taking the Squire with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>); but they could obtain no information. The
miller was very silent, and betrayed hardly any emotion when he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was
told that the police again wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They can come and search,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They can come and search.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) walked slowly away into the mill. There was a scene, of
course, with Mrs. Brattle and Fanny, and the two women were in a sad
way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor boy,--wretched boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the unfortunate mother, who sat
sobbing with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We know nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), Mr. Gilmore, or we would tell at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>said
Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you would,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``And you may remember this,
Mrs. Brattle; I do not for one moment believe that Sam had any more
to do with the murder than you or I. You may tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father that I
say so, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>For saying this the Squire rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) as soon as they had left the
mill. <div class="bookquote">``I think you go too far in giving such assurance as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you would have me say what I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not on such a matter as this, in which any false encouragement may
produce so much increased suffering. You, yourself, are so prone to
take your own views in opposition to those of others that you should
be specially on your guard when you may do so much harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel quite sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had nothing to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see that you have the police against you after a most minute and
prolonged investigation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The police are asses,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>insisted the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so. That is, you prefer your own opinion to theirs in regard to
a murder. I should prefer yours to theirs on a question of scriptural
evidence, but not in such an affair as this. I don't want to talk you
over, but I wish to make you careful with other people who are so
closely concerned. In dealing with others you have no right to throw
over the ordinary rules of evidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>The Vicar accepted the rebuke and promised to be more
careful,--repeating, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own opinion about Sam, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) intention of adhering in regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own conduct, let
the police and magistrates say what they might. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) almost went so far
as to declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) should do so even in opposition to the verdict
of a jury; but Gilmore understood that this was simply the natural
obstinacy of the man, showing itself in its natural form.

<p/>At this moment, which was certainly one of gloom to the parish at
large, and of great sorrow at the Vicarage, the Squire moved about
with a new life which was evident to all who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) went about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) farm, and talked about his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) trees, and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) horses and
had come to life again. No doubt many guesses as to the cause of this
were made throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) establishment, and some of them, probably,
very near the truth. But, for the Fenwicks there was no need of
guessing. Gilmore had been told that Mary Lowther was coming to
Bullhampton in the early summer, and had at once thrown off the cloak
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) sadness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had asked no further questions; Mrs. Fenwick had
found herself unable to express a caution; but the extent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
friend's elation almost frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't look at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``quite as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll have him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answered, and then Mrs. Fenwick said
nothing further.

<p/>To Fenwick himself, this change was one of infinite comfort. The
Squire was his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) old friend and almost his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) only near neighbour. In all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) troubles, whether inside or outside of the parish, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) naturally
went to Gilmore; and, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was a man not very prone to walk by
the advice of friends, still it had been a great thing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) to have
a friend who would give an opinion, and perhaps the more so, as the
friend was one who did not insist on having his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) opinion taken. During
the past winter Gilmore had been of no use whatever to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) opinions on all matters had gone so vitally astray, that they had
not been worth having. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had become so morose, that the Vicar
had found it to be almost absolutely necessary to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) alone as
far as ordinary life was concerned. But now the Squire was himself
again, and on this exciting topic of Trumbull's murder, the prisoners
in Salisbury gaol, and the necessity for Sam's reappearance, could
talk sensibly and usefully.

<p/>It was certainly very expedient that Sam should be made to reappear
as soon as possible. The idea was general in the parish that the
Vicar knew all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). George Brattle, who had become bail for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
brother's reappearance, had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) name on the clear understanding
that the Vicar would be responsible. Some half-sustained tidings of
Carry's presence in Salisbury and of the Vicar's various visits to
the city were current in Bullhampton, and with these were mingled an
idea that Carry and Sam were in league together. That Fenwick was
chivalrous, perhaps Quixotic, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friendships for those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
regarded, had long been felt, and this feeling was now stronger than
ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) certainly could bring up Sam Brattle if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) pleased;--or, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) pleased, as might, some said, not improbably be the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could
keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) away. There would be L400 to pay for the bail-bond, but the
Vicar was known to be rich as well as Quixotic, and,--so said the
Puddlehamites,--would care very little about that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) might thus
secure for himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own way.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was constrained to go over again to Salisbury in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
might, if possible, learn from Carry how to find some trace to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) brother, and of this visit the Puddlehamites also informed
themselves. There were men and women in Bullhampton who knew exactly
how often the Vicar had visited the young woman at Salisbury, how
long he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on each occasion, and how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) paid Mrs.
Stiggs for the accommodation. Gentlemen who are Quixotic in their
kindness to young women are liable to have their goings and comings
chronicled with much exactitude, if not always with accuracy.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) interview with Carry on this occasion was very sad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could not
save himself from telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) in part the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) inquiries.
<div class="bookquote">``They haven't taken the two men, have they?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) asked, with an
eagerness that seemed to imply that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) possessed knowledge on the
matter which could hardly not be guilty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What two men?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) asked, looking full into her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) face. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) was
silent and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was unwilling to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) in a trap, to cross-examine
her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) as a lawyer would do, or to press out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) any communication
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) would not make willingly and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) own free action. <div class="bookquote">``I am
told,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that two men have been taken for the murder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did they find 'em, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They had escaped to America, and the police have brought them back.
Did you know them, Carry?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) was again silent. The men had not been
named, and it was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) to betray them. Hitherto, in their
interviews, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had hardly ever looked him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) in the face, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>)
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) blue eyes full upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You told me before at the old
woman's cottage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that you knew them both,--had known one
too well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir, I won't say nothing about 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not ask you, Carry. But you would tell me about your brother,
if you knew?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I would, sir;--anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hadn't no more to do with Farmer
Trumbull's murder nor you had. They can't touch a hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) head
along of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such is my belief;--but who can prove it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) was silent.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you prove it? If speaking could save your brother, surely you
would speak out. Would you hesitate, Carry, in doing anything for
your brother's sake? Whatever may be his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) faults, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has not been hard
to you like the others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, I wish I was dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not wish that, Carry. And if you know ought of this you
will be bound to speak. If you could bring yourself to tell me what
you know, I think it might be good for both of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was they who had the money. Sam never seed a shilling of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is `they'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jack Burrows and Larry Acorn. And it wasn't Larry Acorn neither,
sir. I know very well who did it. It was Jack Burrows who did it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is he (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) they call the Grinder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Larry was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Larry</b></font>) then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ain't sure of nothing, Mr. Fenwick, only that Sam wasn't there
at all. Of that I am quite, quite, quite sure. But when you asks me,
what am I to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) without speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) on this occasion a word
about herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had nothing to say that would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) any comfort.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had almost made up his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) over with him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
to the mill, and try what might be done by the meeting between the
father, mother, and daughter, but all this new matter about the
police and the arrest, and Sam's absence, made it almost impossible
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) to take such a step at present. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) went, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) again
interrogated Mrs. Stiggs, and was warned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) that words fell daily
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) lodger which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) think that the young woman would not
remain much longer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>). In the meantime there was nothing of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) could complain. Carry insisted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) liberty to go out and
about the city alone; but the woman was of opinion that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did this
simply with the object of asserting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) independence. After that the
necessary payment was made, and the Vicar returned to the Railway
Station. Of Sam he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had learned nothing, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) did not know where
to go for tidings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) still believed that the young man would come of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own accord, if the demand for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) appearance were made so public
as to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) ear.

<p/>On that same day there was a meeting of the magistrates at
Heytesbury, and the two men who had been so cruelly fetched back from
San Francisco were brought before it. Mr. Gilmore was on the bench,
along with Sir Thomas Charleys, who was the chairman, and three other
gentlemen. Lord Trowbridge was in the court house, and sat upon the
bench, but gave it out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) was not sitting there as a magistrate.
Samuel Brattle was called upon to answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) bail, and Jones, the
attorney appearing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had gone from home
to seek work elsewhere, alluded to the length of time that had
elapsed, and to the injustice of presuming that a man against whom no
evidence had been adduced, should be bound to remain always in one
parish,--and expressed himself without any doubt that Mr. Fenwick
and Mr. George Brattle, who were his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) bailsmen, would cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to be
found and brought forward. As neither the clergyman nor the farmer
were in court, nothing further could be done at once; and the
magistrates were quite ready to admit that time must be allowed. Nor
was the case at all ready against the two men who were in custody.
Indeed, against them the evidence was so little substantial that a
lawyer from Devizes, who attended on their behalf, expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
amazement that the American authorities should have given them
up, and suggested that it must have been done with some view to a
settlement of the Alabama claims. Evidence, however, was brought
up to show that the two men had been convicted before, the one for
burglary, and the other for horse-stealing; that the former, John
Burrows, known as the Grinder, was a man from Devizes with whom the
police about that town, and at Chippenham, Bath, and Wells, were
well acquainted; that the other, Acorn, was a young man who had been
respectable, as a partner in a livery stable at Birmingham, but who
had taken to betting, and had for a year past been living by evil
courses, having previously undergone two years of imprisonment
with hard labour. It was proved that they had been seen in the
neighbourhood both before and after the murder; that boots found in
the cottage at Pycroft Common fitted certain footmarks in the mud
of the farmer's yard; that Burrows had been supplied with a certain
poison at a county chemist's at Lavington, and that the dog Bone'm
had been poisoned with the like. Many other matters were proved,
all of which were declared by the lawyer from Devizes to amount to
nothing, and by the police authorities, who were prosecutors, to be
very much. The magistrates of course ordered a remand, and ordered
also that on the day named Sam Brattle should appear. It was
understood that that day week was only named pro forma, the
constables having explained that at least a fortnight would be
required for the collection of further evidence. This took place on
Tuesday, the 25th of April, and it was understood that time up to the
8th of May would be given to the police to complete their case.

<p/>So far all went on quietly at Heytesbury; but before the magistrates
left the little town there was a row. Sir Thomas Charleys, in
speaking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charleys</b></font>) brother magistrate, Mr. Gilmore, about the whole
affair and about the Brattles in particular, had alluded to <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Fenwick's unfortunate connexion with Carry Brattle''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>at Salisbury.
Gilmore fired up at once, and demanded to know the meaning of this.
Sir Thomas, who was not the wisest man in the world, but who had
ideas of justice, and as to whom, in giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) due, it must
be owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was afraid of no one, after some hesitation,
acknowledged that what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard respecting Mr. Fenwick had fallen
from Lord Trowbridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) had heard from Lord Trowbridge that the
Vicar of Bullhampton was * * *. Gilmore on the occasion became
full of energy, and pressed the baronet very hard. Sir Thomas hoped
that Mr. Gilmore was not going to make mischief. Mr. Gilmore declared
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would not submit to the injury done to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would question Lord Trowbridge on the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) did question
Lord Trowbridge, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) found waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) carriage, in the
parlour of the Bull Inn, Sir Thomas having accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in the
search. The Marquis was quite outspoken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) said, from
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did not doubt to be good authority, that Mr. Fenwick was
in the habit of visiting alone a young woman who had lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
parish, but whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) now maintained in lodgings in a low alley in the
suburbs of Salisbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had said so much as that. In so saying, had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) spoken truth or falsehood? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had said anything untrue, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
would be the first to acknowledge his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own error.

<p/>Then there had come to be very hot words. <div class="bookquote">``My lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Gilmore, <div class="bookquote">``your insinuation is untrue. Whatever your words may have
been, in the impression which they have made, they are slanderous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) from head to
foot, <div class="bookquote">``to talk to me of the impression of my words?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Gilmore's blood was up. <div class="bookquote">``You intended to convey to Sir Thomas
Charleys, my lord, that Mr. Fenwick's visits were of a disgraceful
nature. If your words did not convey that, they conveyed nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are you, sir, that you should interpret my words? I did no more
than my duty in conveying to Sir Thomas Charleys my conviction,--my
well-grounded conviction,--as to the gentleman's conduct. What I said
to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) I will say aloud to the whole county. It is notorious that the
Vicar of Bullhampton is in the habit of visiting a profligate young
woman in a low part of the city. That I say is disgraceful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>),
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) cloth, and to the parish, and I shall give my opinion to the
bishop to that effect. Who are you, sir, that you should question
my words?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>And again the Marquis eyed the Squire from head to foot,
leaving the room with a majestic strut as Gilmore went on to assert
that the allegation made, with the sense implied by it, contained
a wicked and a malicious slander. Then there were some words, much
quieter than those preceding them, between Mr. Gilmore and Sir
Thomas, in which the Squire pledged himself to,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hardly knew what,
and Sir Thomas promised to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) tongue,--for the present. But,
as a matter of course, the quarrel flew all over the little town. It
was out of the question that such a man as the Marquis of Trowbridge
should keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) wrath confined. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had left the inn-yard he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
had expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) opinion very plainly to half-a-dozen persons, both
as to the immorality of the Vicar and the impudence of the Squire;
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was taken home his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hand was itching for pen and paper in
order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) might write to the bishop. Sir Thomas shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
shoulders, and did not tell the story to more than three or four
confidential friends, to all of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) remarked that on the matter
of the visits made to the girl, there never was smoke without fire.
Gilmore's voice, too, had been loud, and all the servants about the
inn had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) knew that the quarrel was already public, and
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had no alternative but to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend what had
passed.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Who are you, sir, that you should interpret
my words?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>On that same evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) saw the Vicar. Fenwick had returned from
Salisbury, tired, dispirited, and ill at ease, and was just going in
to dress for dinner, when Gilmore met him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own stable-door, and
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) what had occurred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, after all, my wife was right and I was wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right about what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>Gilmore asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said that Lord Trowbridge would spread these very lies. I
confess that I made the mistake of believing him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) to be a gentleman.
Of course I may use your information?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Use it just as you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore. Then they parted, and
Gilmore, who was on horseback, rode home.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII.

<p/>MARY LOWTHER RETURNS TO BULLHAMPTON.


<p/>A month went by after the scenes described in the last chapter, and
summer had come at Bullhampton. It was now the end of May, and, with
the summer, Mary Lowther had arrived. During the month very little
progress had been made with the case at Heytesbury. There had been
two or three remands, and now there was yet another. The police
declared that this was rendered necessary by the absence of Sam
Brattle,--that the magistrates were anxious to give all reasonable
time for the production of the man who was out upon bail,--and that,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was undoubtedly concerned in the murder, they were determined
to have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But they who professed to understand the case, among
whom were the lawyer from Devizes and Mr. Jones of Heytesbury,
declared that no real search had been made for Brattle because
the evidence in regard to the other men was hitherto inefficient.
The remand now stood again till Tuesday, June the 5th, and it was
understood that if Brattle did not then appear the bail would be
declared to have been forfeited.

<p/>Fenwick had written a very angry letter to Lord Trowbridge, to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) had got no answer, and Lord Trowbridge had written a very silly
letter to the bishop, in replying to which the bishop had snubbed
him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am informed by my friend, Mr. Gilmore,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar to
the Marquis, <div class="bookquote">``that your lordship has stated openly that I have made
visits to a young woman in Salisbury which are disgraceful to me, to
my cloth, and to the parish of which I am the incumbent. I do not
believe that your lordship will deny that you have done so, and I,
therefore, call upon you at once to apologise to me for the calumny,
which, in its nature, is as injurious and wicked as calumny can
be, and to promise that you will not repeat the offence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>The
Marquis, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) received this, had not as yet written that letter
to the bishop on which he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had resolved after his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) interview with
Gilmore,--feeling, perhaps, some qualms of conscience, thinking that
it might be well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) should consult his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) son,--though with a
full conviction that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) did so, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) son would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) to
write to the bishop at all,--possibly with some feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had
been too hard upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) enemy, the Vicar. But, when the letter from
Bullhampton reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), all feelings of doubt, caution, and mercy,
were thrown to the winds. The tone of the letter was essentially
aggressive and impudent. It was the word calumny that offended him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
most, that, and the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), the Marquis of Trowbridge, should
be called upon to promise not to commit an offence! The pestilent
infidel at Bullhampton, as he (<font color='blue'><b>infidel</b></font>) called our friend, had not attempted to
deny the visits to the young woman at Salisbury. And the Marquis had
made fresh inquiry which had completely corroborated his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) previous
information. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had learned Mrs. Stiggs's address, and the name of
Trotter's Buildings, which details were to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trotter</b></font>) mind circumstantial,
corroborative, and damnatory. Some dim account of the battle at the
Three Honest Men had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Trotter</b></font>), and the undoubted fact that Carry
Brattle was maintained by the Vicar. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) remembered all Fenwick's
old anxiety on behalf of the brother, whom the Marquis had taught
himself to regard as the very man who had murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) tenant.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) reminded himself, too, of the murderer's present escape from
justice by aid of this pestilent clergyman; and thus became
convinced that in dealing with Mr. Fenwick, as it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) undoubted
duty to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had to deal with one of the very worst of the human
race. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) lordship's mind was one utterly incapable of sifting
evidence,--unable even to understand evidence when it came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was not a bad man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) desired nothing that was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own, and
remitted much that was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) feared God, honoured the Queen, and loved
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) country. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was not self-indulgent. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) duties as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew
them. But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was an arrogant old fool, who could not keep himself
from mischief,--who could only be kept from mischief by the aid of
some such master as his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) son. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) received the Vicar's
letter he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) at once sat down and wrote to the bishop. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was so sure
that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was right, that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sent Fenwick's letter to the bishop,
acknowledging what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) himself had said at Heytesbury, and justifying
it altogether by an elaborate account of the Vicar's wickedness. <div class="bookquote">``And
now, my lord, let me ask you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), in conclusion, <div class="bookquote">``whether you
deem this a proper man to have the care of souls in the large and
important parish of Bullhampton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The bishop felt himself to be very much bullied. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had no doubt
whatsoever about his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) parson. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) knew that Fenwick was too strong a
man to be acted upon beneficially by such advice as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) private
conduct as a bishop might give, and too good a man to need any
caution as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conduct. <div class="bookquote">``My Lord Marquis,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in reply, <div class="bookquote">``in
returning the endorsed letter from Mr. Fenwick to your lordship, I
can only say that nothing has been brought before me by your lordship
which seems to me to require my interference. I should be wrong if I
did not add to this the expression of my opinion that Mr. Fenwick is
a moral man, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) duty in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) parish well, and an example in my
diocese to be followed, rather than a stumbling block.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When this letter reached the Castle Lord St. George was there. The
poor old Marquis was cut to the quick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) immediately perceived,--so
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) told himself,--that the bishop was an old woman, who understood
nothing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was sure that St. George would not look at the matter
in the same light. And yet it was impossible not to tell St. George.
Much as he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) dreaded his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) son, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did honestly tell everything to his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
Mentor. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) had already told St. George of Fenwick's letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
and of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) letter to the bishop, and St. George had whistled. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
showed the bishop's letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son. St. George read the letter,
refolded it slowly, shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shoulders, and said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) returned
it to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my lord, I suppose you like a hornet's nest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the uncomfortable position of things at Bullhampton about
the beginning of June, at which time Mary Lowther was again staying
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) friend Mrs. Fenwick. Carry Brattle was still at Salisbury,
but had not been seen by the Vicar for more than a fortnight. The
Marquis's letter, backed as it was in part by his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) wife's counsel,
had, much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own disgust, deterred him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) from seeing the girl. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
wife, however, had herself visited Trotter's Buildings, and had seen
Carry, taking to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a little present from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother, who did not
dare to go over to Salisbury to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) child, because of words that
had passed between her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband.

<p/>Mrs. Fenwick, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) return home, had reported that Carry was silent,
sullen, and idle; that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) only speech was an expression of a wish
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was dead, and that Mrs. Stiggs had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) could get
no good of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>). In the meantime Sam Brattle had not yet turned up,
and the 5th of June was at hand.

<p/>Mary Lowther was again at the vicarage, and of course it was
necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) and Mr. Gilmore should meet each other. A promise
had been made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) that no advice should be pressed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>),--the
meaning of which, of course, was that nothing should be said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to marry Mr. Gilmore. But it was of course understood by
all the parties concerned that Mr. Gilmore was to be allowed to come
to the house; and, indeed, this was understood by the Fenwicks to
mean almost as plainly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would at least endeavour to bring
herself to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) did come. To Mary herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made
the journey, the same meaning seemed to be almost inevitable; and as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) perceived this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been wrong to leave
home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and
in doing so would simply be making fresh trouble. Would it not have
been better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to have remained at Loring,--to have put herself
at once on a par with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt, and have commenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life of
solitary spinsterhood and dull routine? But, then, why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) endeavoured to argue it out with herself in the
railway carriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been told that Walter Marrable would
certainly marry Edith Brownlow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) believed it. No doubt it was
much better that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) should do so. At any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) and Walter were
separated for ever. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) purpose
of remaining in England, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had said not a word of renewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
engagement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>). No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). About that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) did not
for a moment endeavour to deceive herself. No doubt, if that fate in
life which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) most desired might be hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) would become the wife
of Walter Marrable. But that fate would not be hers, and then there
arose the question whether, on that account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was unfit to be the
wife of any other man. Of this she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was quite certain, that should it
ever seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) duty to accept the other man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) would
first explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clearly the position in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) found herself.
At last the whole matter resolved itself to this;--was it possible
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) to divest her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) idea of life of all romance, and to look for
contentment and satisfaction in the performance of duties to others?
The prospect of an old maid's life at Loring was not pleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
eyes; but she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would bear that, and worse than that, rather than do
wrong. It was, however, so hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) to know what was right and
what was wrong! Supposing that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) were to consent to marry Mr.
Gilmore, would she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) be forsworn when at the altar she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) promised to love
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)? All her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) care would be henceforth for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), all her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heart, as far
as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) could command her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heart, and certainly all her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) truth. There
should not be a secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mind hidden from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would force
herself to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and to forget that other man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be the
object of all her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) idolatry. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would, in that case, do her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) very
utmost to reward him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the constancy of the affection with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>); and yet, as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was driven in at the vicarage gate,
she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) told herself that it would have been better for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) to remain at
Loring.

<p/>During the first evening Mr. Gilmore's name was not mentioned. There
were subjects enough for conversation, as the period was one of great
excitement in Bullhampton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you think of our chapel?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no idea it was so big.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, they are not going to leave us a single soul to go to church.
Mr. Puddleham means to make a clean sweep of the parish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say that any have left you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; none as yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Fenwick. <div class="bookquote">``But then the chapel isn't
finished; and the Marquis has not yet sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) order to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) tenants
to become dissenters. We expect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) will do so, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) can
persuade the bishop to turn Frank out of the living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the bishop couldn't turn him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) couldn't,--and wouldn't if he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could. The bishop and
Frank are the best friends in the world. But that has nothing to do
with it. You mustn't abuse the chapel to Frank; just at this moment
the subject is tabooed. My belief is that the whole edifice will have
to come down, and that the confusion of Mr. Puddleham and the Marquis
will be something more complete than ever was yet seen. In the
meantime, I put my finger to my lip, and just look at Frank whenever
the chapel is mentioned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>And then there was the matter of the murder, and the somewhat sad
consideration of Sam's protracted absence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And will you have to pay four hundred pounds, Mr. Fenwick?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>Mary
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be liable to pay it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) does not appear to-morrow, and no
doubt must absolutely pay it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) does not turn up soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was one of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was not. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has had trouble in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) family,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) got into a quarrel, and I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has left the country. The
police say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has been traced to Liverpool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will the other men be convicted?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Fenwick asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe they will, and most fervently hope so. They have some
evidence about the wheels of a small cart in which Burrows certainly,
and, I believe, no doubt Acorn also, were seen to drive across
Pycroft Common early on the Sunday morning. A part of the tire had
come off, and another bit, somewhat broader, and an inch or so too
short, had been substituted. The impress made by this wheel in the
mud, just round the corner by the farm gate, was measured and copied
at the time, and they say that this will go far to identify the men.
That the man's cart was there is certain,--also that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in the
same cart at Pycroft Common an hour or two after the murder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That does seem clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But somebody suggests that Sam had borrowed the cart. I believe,
however, that it will all come out;--only, if I have to pay four
hundred pounds I shall think that Farmer Trumbull has cost me very
dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/>On the next morning Gilmore came to the vicarage. It had been
arranged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would drive Fenwick over to Heytesbury, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
would call for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) after breakfast. A somewhat late hour,--two in the
afternoon,--had been fixed for going on with the murder case, as it
was necessary that a certain constable should come down from London
on that morning; and, therefore, there would be no need for the two
men to start very early from Bullhampton. This was explained to Mary
by Mrs. Fenwick. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) dines here to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had said when they met
in the morning before prayers, <div class="bookquote">``and you may as well get over the
first awkwardness at once.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mary had assented to this, and, after
breakfast, Gilmore made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) appearance among them in the garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
was just one moment alone with the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) loved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Lowther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot be with you for an instant without
telling you that I am unchanged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary made no reply, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) said nothing further. Mrs. Fenwick was
with them so quickly that there was no need for a reply,--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
was gone. During the whole day the two friends talked of the murder,
and of the Brattles, and the chapel,--which was thoroughly inspected
from the roof to the floor,--but not a word was said about the
loves of Harry Gilmore or Walter Marrable. Gilmore's name was often
mentioned as the whole story was told of Lord Trowbridge's new
quarrel, and of the correspondence with the bishop,--of which Fenwick
had learned the particulars from the bishop's chaplain. And in the
telling of this story Mrs. Fenwick did not scruple to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
opinion that Harry Gilmore had behaved well, with good spirit, and
like a true friend. <div class="bookquote">``If the Marquis had been anywhere near his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own
age I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would have horsewhipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar's wife,
with that partiality for the corporal chastisement of an enemy which
is certainly not uncommon to the feminine mind. This was all very
well, and called for no special remark from Mary, and possibly might
have an effect.

<p/>The gentlemen returned late in the evening, and the Squire dressed at
the vicarage. But the great event of the day had to be told before
anyone was allowed to dress. Between four and five o'clock, just as
the magistrates were going to leave the bench, Sam Brattle had walked
into Court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your money is safe?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) wife.

<p/>``Yes, my money is safe; but, I declare, I think more of Sam's truth.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was there, as it seemed, all of a sudden. The police had learned
nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) just walked into the court, and we heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
voice. ``They tell me I'm wanted,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) gave himself
up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what was done?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was too late to do anything; so they allowed a remand for another
week, and Sam was walked off to prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At dinner time the conversation was still about the murder. It had
been committed after Mary Lowther had left Bullhampton; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had
heard all the details, and was now as able to be interested about
it as were the others. It was Gilmore's opinion that, instead of
proceeding against Sam, they would put him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) into the witness-box and
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) tell what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) knew about the presence of the other two men.
Fenwick declared that, if they did so, such was Sam's obstinacy that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would tell nothing. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own idea,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had explained
both to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) wife and to Gilmore,--that Carry Brattle could give more
evidence respecting the murder than her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother. Of this he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said
nothing at present, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had informed Constable Toffy that if
Caroline Brattle were wanted for the examination she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) would be found
at the house of Mrs. Stiggs.

<p/>Thus for an hour or two the peculiar awkwardness of the meeting
between Harry Gilmore and Mary was removed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was enabled to
talk with energy on a matter of interest, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could join the
conversation. But when they were round the tea-table it seemed to be
arranged by common consent that Trumbull's murder and the Brattles
should, for a while, be laid aside. Then Mary became silent and
Gilmore became awkward. When inquiries were made as to Miss Marrable,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) did not know whether to seem to claim, or not to claim, that
lady's acquaintance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could not, of course, allude to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) visit
to Loring, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could hardly save himself from having to
acknowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had been there. However, the hour wore itself
away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was allowed to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) departure.

<p/>During the next two days he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) did not see Mary Lowthcr. On the Friday
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with Mrs. Fenwick as the two were returning from the mill.
They had gone to visit Mrs. Brattle and Fanny, and to administer such
comfort as was possible in the present circumstances. The poor woman
told them that the father was now as silent about his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son as about
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had himself gone over to Heytesbury to
secure legal advice for the lad, and to learn from Mr. Jones, the
attorney, what might be the true aspect of the case. Of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had
learned he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had told nothing to the women at the mill, but the two
ladies had expressed their strong opinion of Sam's innocence. All
this was narrated by Mrs. Fenwick to Gilmore, and Mary Lowther was
enabled to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) part in the narrative. The Squire was walking
between the two, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) walked that Mary at least
had no desire to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) became high in hope, and began to wish
that even now, at this moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) might be left alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and
might learn his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) fate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) parted from them when they were near the
village, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) went he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) held Mary's hand within his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own for a few
moments. There was no return of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) pressure, but it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand was left with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) almost willingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
parted from them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)? I have always thought well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you have; to think otherwise of one who is positively so good
would be impossible. But do you feel more kindly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) than you
used?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Janet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, after pausing awhile, <div class="bookquote">``you had better leave me
alone. Don't be angry with me; but really it will be better that you
should leave me alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't be angry with you, and I will leave you alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Fenwick. And, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) considered this request afterwards, it seemed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that the very making of such a request implied a determination on
the girl's part to bring herself to accept the man's offer,--if it
might be possible.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIX.

<p/>MARY LOWTHER``S DOOM.


<p/>The police were so very tedious in managing their business, and
the whole affair of the second magisterial investigation was so
protracted, that people in the neighbourhood became almost tired of
it, in spite of that appetite for excitement which the ordinary quiet
life of a rural district produces. On the first Tuesday in June Sam
had surrendered himself at Heytesbury, and on the second Tuesday it
was understood that the production of the prisoners was only formal.
The final examination, and committal, if the evidence should be
sufficient, was to take place on the third Tuesday in the month.
Against this Mr. Jones had remonstrated very loudly on Sam's behalf,
protesting that the magistrates were going beyond their power in
locking up a man against whom there was no more evidence now than
there had been when before they had found themselves compelled to
release him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on bail. But this was of no avail. Sam had been released
before because the men who were supposed to have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) accomplices
were not in custody; and now that they were in custody the police
declared it to be out of the question that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) should be left at
large. The magistrates of course agreed with the police, in spite of
the indignation of Mr. Jones. In the meantime a subpoena was served
upon Carry Brattle to appear on that final Tuesday,--Tuesday the
nineteenth of June. The policeman, when he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) served her (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) with the paper,
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) that on the morning in question he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) would come and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).
The poor girl said not a word as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand the dreadful
document. Mrs. Stiggs asked a question or two of the man, but
got from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no information. But it was well known in Trotter's
Buildings, and round about the Three Honest Men, that Sam Brattle was
to be tried for the murder of Mr. Trumbull, and public opinion in
that part of Salisbury was adverse to Sam. Public opinion was averse,
also, to poor Carry; and Mrs. Stiggs was becoming almost tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>)
lodger, although the payment made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) was not ungenerous and was
as punctual as the sun. In truth, the tongue of the landlady of the
Three Honest Men was potential in those parts, and was very bitter
against Sam and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sister.

<p/>In the meantime there was a matter of interest which, to our friends
at Bullhampton, exceeded even that of the Heytesbury examinations.
Mr. Gilmore was now daily at the vicarage on some new or old lover's
pretence. It might be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) stood but for a minute or two on the
terrace outside the drawing-room windows, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would sit with
the ladies during half the afternoon, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would come down to
dinner,--some excuse having arisen for an invitation to that effect
during the morning. Very little was said on the subject between Mrs.
Fenwick and Mary Lowther, and not a word between the Vicar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
guest; but between Mr. and Mrs. Fenwick many words were spoken, and
before the first week was over they were sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would yield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick;--<div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) will do it in
agony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then if I were Harry I would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not Harry; and if you were, you would be wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) will
not be happy when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) accepts him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); but by the time the day fixed for
the wedding comes round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) will have reconciled herself to it, and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) will be as loving a wife as ever a man had.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>But the Vicar
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) head and said that, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was concerned, love of
that sort would not have sufficed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``it is very pleasant for a man to be told
that the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves is dying for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but men can't always have
everything that they want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary Lowther at this time became subject to a feeling of shame which
almost overwhelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>). There grew upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) a consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
had allowed herself to come to Bullhampton on purpose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) might
receive a renewed offer of marriage from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) old lover, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had done so because her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) new and favoured lover had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>). Of
course she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) must accept Mr. Gilmore. Of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had now become quite
sure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had come to Bullhampton,--so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) now told herself,--because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had been taught to believe that it would not be right for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to
abandon herself to a mode of life which was not to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) taste. All the
friends in whose judgment she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could confide expressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) in every
possible way their desire that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) should marry this man; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
had made this journey with the view of following their counsel. So
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) thought of herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) doings; but such was not in truth the
case. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) first determined to visit Bullhampton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was very
far from thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would accept the man. Mrs. Fenwick's
argument that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) should not be kept away from Bullhampton by fear of
Mr. Gilmore, had prevailed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>),--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had come. And now that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was there, and that this man was daily with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), it was no longer
possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) should refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And, after all, what did it
matter? She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was becoming sick of the importance which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) imputed to
herself in thinking of herself. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could make the man happy why
should she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) not do so? The romance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) life had become to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) a
rhodomontade of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was ashamed. What was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) love, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
should think so much about it? What did it mean? Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) not do her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
duty in the position in life in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friends wished to place
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), without hankering after a something which was not to be bestowed
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)? After all, what did it all matter? She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would tell the man the
exact truth as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew how to tell it, and then let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) or leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listed.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the truth, after the following fashion. It
came to pass at last that a day and an hour was fixed in which Mr.
Gilmore might come to the vicarage and find Mary alone. There were no
absolute words arranging this to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a party, but it was
understood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not even pretend an unwillingness to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>),
and had assented by silence when Mrs. Fenwick had said that the man
should be put out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suspense. Mary, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was silent, knew
well that it was no longer within her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) power to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew, too, or fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew,
what would be the result of the interview. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would accept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
without protestations of violent love for himself, acknowledging what
had passed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin, and proffering to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) the
offer of future affection. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had pictured it all to himself, and
knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) intended to accept what would be tendered. There were
drawbacks in the happiness which was in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), but still
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would take what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could get. As each so nearly understood the
purpose of the other it was almost a pity that the arrangement could
not be made without any words between them,--words which could hardly
be pleasant either in the speaking or in the hearing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would disembarrass himself of all
preliminary flourishes in addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and had his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) speech ready as
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) by the hand. <div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you know why I am here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) made no reply. <div class="bookquote">``I told you when I first saw you again
that I was unchanged.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) paused, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) expected that she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
would answer him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), but still she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am unchanged.
When you were here before I told you that I could look forward to no
happiness unless you would consent to be my wife. That was nearly a
year ago, and I have come again now to tell you the same thing. I do
not think but what you will believe me to be in earnest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that you are in earnest,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No man was ever more so. My constancy has been tried during the time
that you have been away. I do not say so as a reproach to you. Of
course there can be no reproach. I have nothing to complain of in
your conduct to me. But I think I may say that if my regard for you
has outlived the pain of those months there is some evidence that it
is sincere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never doubted your sincerity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor can you doubt my constancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except in this, that it is so often that we want that which we have
not, and find it so little worthy of having when we get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not say that from your heart, Mary. If you mean to refuse me
again, it is not because you doubt the reality of my love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not mean to refuse you again, Mr. Gilmore.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) attempted
to put his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) waist, but she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) recoiled from him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), not in
anger, but very quietly, and with a womanly grace that was perfect.
<div class="bookquote">``But you must hear me first, before I can allow you to take me in the
only way in which I can bestow myself. I have been steeling myself to
this, and I must tell you all that has occurred since we were last
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should be spared;--anxious
also that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) himself should be spared the pain of hearing that which
she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was about to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).

<p/>But it was necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should say it. She (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would not go
to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) accepted mistress upon other terms than those she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had
already proposed to herself. <div class="bookquote">``Though you know it, I must speak of
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I should not, otherwise, be dealing honestly either
with you or with myself. Since I saw you last, I have met my cousin,
Captain Marrable. I became attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) with a quickness which
I cannot even myself understand. I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) dearly, and we were
engaged to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wrote to me, Mary, and told me all that.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said, striving
to hide the impatience which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) felt; but striving in vain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did so, and now I have to tell you that that engagement is at
an end. Circumstances occurred,--a sad loss of income that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had
expected,--which made it imperative on him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), and also on me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
behalf, that we should abandon our hopes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would have been ruined
by such a marriage,--and it is all over.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) paused, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had done; but there was more to be said, words
heavier to be borne than any which she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had yet uttered. <div class="bookquote">``And I love
him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) still. I should lie if I said that it was not so. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) were free
to marry me this moment I should go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said this, there
came a black cloud across his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) brow; but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) stood silent to hear it
all to the last. <div class="bookquote">``My respect and esteem for you are boundless,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
continued,--<div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has my heart. It is only because I know that I
cannot be his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wife that I have allowed myself to think whether it is
my duty to become the wife of another man. After what I now say to
you, I do not expect that you will persevere. Should you do so, you
must give me time.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) paused, as though it were now his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) turn
to speak; but there was something further that she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) felt herself
bound to say, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was still silent, she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``My
friends,--those whom I most trust in the world, my aunt and Janet
Fenwick, all tell me that it will be best for me to accept your
offer. I have made no promise to either of them. I would tell my
mind to no one till I told it to you. I believe I owe as much to
you,--almost as much as a woman can owe to a man; but still, were my
cousin so placed that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could afford to marry a poor wife, I should
leave you and go to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) at once. I have told you everything now; and
if, after this, you can think me worth having, I can only promise
that I will endeavour, at some future time, to do my duty to you as
your wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had finished, and she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)--waiting
her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) doom.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) brow had become black and still blacker as she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) continued her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
speech. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) without quailing for a moment,
and had hoped for some moment of tenderness, some sparkle of feeling,
at seeing which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) might have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) arms and have stopped
the sternness of her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) speech. But she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had been at least as strong as
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was, and had not allowed herself to show the slightest sign of
weakness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not love me, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I esteem you as we esteem our dearest friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will never love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How shall I answer you? I do love you,--but not as I love him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). I
shall never again have that feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). If it is to be conquered, I will conquer it. I know,
Mr. Gilmore, that what I have told you will drive you from me. It
ought to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is for me to judge of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said, turning upon her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In judging for myself I have thought it right to tell you the exact
truth, and to let you know what it is that you would possess if you
should choose to take me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then again she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was silent, and waited for
her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) doom.

<p/>There was a pause of, perhaps, a couple of minutes, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
made no reply. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) walked the length of the room twice, slowly, before
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) uttered a word, and during that time he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) did not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). Had
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) chosen to take an hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would not have interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) again.
She (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) everything, and it was for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) now to decide. After
what she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could not but recall his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) offer. How was it
possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should desire to make a woman his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wife after such a
declaration as that which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had made to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is for me to decide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Gilmore, it is for you to decide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), coming up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``you are
my betrothed. May God in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mercy soften your heart to me, and
enable you to give me some return for all the love that I bear you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) hand and raised it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips and kissed it, and then
had left the room before he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was able to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER L.

<p/>MARY LOWTHER INSPECTS HER FUTURE HOME.


<p/>Of course it was soon known in the vicarage that Mary Lowther
had accepted the Squire's hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) standing in
the drawing-room;--had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) very abruptly, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had
condescended to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hand. Perhaps in no way could she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) have made
a kinder reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) petition for mercy. In ordinary cases it is
probably common for a lady, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has yielded to a gentleman's
entreaties for the gift of herself, to yield also something further
for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) immediate gratification, and to submit herself to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
embrace. In this instance it was impossible that the lady should do
so. After the very definite manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feelings, it was out of the question that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should stay and toy
with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>);--that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should bear the pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arm, or return
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) caresses. But there had come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a sharp desire to show her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
gratitude before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),--to show her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gratitude, and to prove,
by some personal action towards him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), that though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been forced
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),--that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
after the fashion in which his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) love was given to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),--that yet he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
was dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), as our dearest friends are dear. And therefore, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in sign of the offer which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
was making her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had raised it to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips and kissed it.

<p/>Very shortly after she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had left the room Mrs. Fenwick came to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said, coming up close to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
eyes to see how it had fared with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``tell me that I may wish you
joy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>betrothed</b></font>) has promised that she (<font color='blue'><b>betrothed</b></font>) will be my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is not that what you have so long wished?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why are you not elated?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>betrothed</b></font>) will tell you all. But do not suppose, Mrs.
Fenwick, that I am not thankful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has behaved very well,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
has accepted me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has explained to me in what way her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) acceptance
has been given, and I have submitted to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Harry, you are going to make yourself wretched about some
romantic trifle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to make myself miserable at all. I am much less
miserable than I could have believed to be possible six months ago.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) will be my wife, and I do not for a moment
think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) will go back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not won her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) as other men do. Never mind;--I do not mean to
complain. Mrs. Fenwick, I shall trust you to let me know when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
will be glad to see me here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you will come when you like and how you like. You must be
quite at home here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as you and Frank are concerned, that would be a
matter-of-course to me. But it cannot be so--yet--in regard to Mary.
At any rate, I will not intrude upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) till I know that my coming
will not be a trouble to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>After this it was not necessary that
Mrs. Fenwick should be told much more of the manner in which these
new betrothals had been made.

<p/>Mary was, of course, congratulated both by the Vicar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) received their congratulations with a dignity of deportment
which, even from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), almost surprised them. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said scarcely a
word, but smiled as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was kissed by each of them and did whisper
something as to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might be able to make Mr. Gilmore
happy. There was certainly no triumph; and there was no visible sign
of regret. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was asked whether she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
should come to the vicarage, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
come just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) pleased. If she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) only knew of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) coming beforehand
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would take care that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would be within to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). Whatever
might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wishes, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would obey them. Mrs. Fenwick suggested that
Gilmore would like her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to go up to the Privets, and look at the house
which was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) future home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) promised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would go with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) at any hour that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) might appoint. Then there was something said
as to fixing the day of the wedding. <div class="bookquote">``It is not to be immediately,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) promised me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would give me time.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) speaks
of it as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going to be hung,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>the Vicar said afterwards
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife.

<p/>On the day after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) engagement she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) saw Gilmore, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wrote
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) aunt to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) the tidings. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) letter was very short, and
had not Miss Marrable thoroughly understood the character of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
niece, and the agony of the struggle to which Mary was now subjected,
it would have seemed to be cold and ungrateful. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
the letter, <div class="bookquote">``Yesterday I accepted Mr. Gilmore's offer. I know you
will be glad to hear this, as you have always thought that I ought
to do so. No time has been fixed for the wedding, but it will not be
very soon. I hope I may do my duty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) happy; but I
do not know whether I should not have been more useful in remaining
with my affectionate aunt.''  (<font color='red'><b>no friend</b></font>)</div>That was the whole letter, and there
was no other friend to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) herself communicated the tidings.
It occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) for a moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would write to Walter
Marrable;--but Walter Marrable had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nothing of Edith
Brownlow. Walter Marrable would learn the news fast enough. And then,
the writing of such a letter would not have been very easy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/>On the Sunday afternoon, after church, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked up to the Privets
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lover. The engagement had been made on the previous
Thursday, and this was the first occasion on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been
alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) for more than a minute or two at a time since she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
then parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). They started immediately from the churchyard,
passing out through the gate which led into Mr. Trumbull's field, and
it was understood that they were to return for an early dinner at the
vicarage. Mary had made many resolutions as to this walk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would
talk much, so that it might not be tedious and melancholy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
would praise everything, and show the interest which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took in the
house and grounds; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would ask questions, and display no hesitation
as to claiming her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own future share of possession in all that
belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went off at once as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was through the
wicket gate, asking questions as to the division of the property of
the parish between the two owners, as to this field and that field,
and the little wood which they passed, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sharp intelligence
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was over-acting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) part. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was no actor,
but unconsciously he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) effort; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) resented it,
unconsciously also, by short answers and an uninterested tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
was aware of it all, and felt that there had been a mistake. It
would be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to leave the play in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) hands, and to adapt
herself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) moods.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had better go straight up to the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) said, as soon as the
pathway had led them off Lord Trowbridge's land into his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) own domain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we had,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we go round by the stables it will make us late for Fenwick's
dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We ought to be back by half-past two,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. They had left the
church exactly at half-past twelve, and were therefore to be together
for two hours.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) over the house. The showing of a house in such
circumstances is very trying, both to the man and to the woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
weighted by a mixed load of pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) possession and of assumed
humility. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), to whom every detail of the future nest is so vitally
important, is almost bound to praise, though every encomium she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
pronounces will be a difficulty in the way of those changes which
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) contemplates. But on the present occasion Mary contemplated
no change. Marrying this man, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was about to do, professedly
without loving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was bound to take everything else as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
found it. The dwelling rooms of the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had known before; the
dining-room, the drawing-room, and the library. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was now taken
into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) private chamber, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat as a magistrate, and paid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
men, and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guns and fishing-rods. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat down for a
moment, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) this and that,--how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always
here for so long in the morning, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would come
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sometimes when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thus busy, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came and stood over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),
putting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``will you not
kiss me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, jumping up, and offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) salute. A month or two ago he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have given the world for
permission to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); and now it seemed as though the thing itself
were a matter but of little joy. A kiss to be joyful should be
stolen, with a conviction on the part of the offender that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) who
has suffered the loss will never prosecute the thief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had meant
to be good to him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>), but the favour would have gone further with him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>)
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made more of it.

<p/>Then they went up stairs. Who does not know the questions that were
asked and that were answered? On this occasion they were asked and
answered with matter-of-fact useful earnestness. The papers on the
walls were perhaps old and ugly; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not mind it if they
were so. If he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) liked to have the rooms new papered, of course it
would be nice. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) like new furniture? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) object to the
old-fashioned four-post bedsteads? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) any special taste about
hangings and colours? Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not bring
herself to indulge them by giving orders as to this or that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
praised everything; was satisfied with everything; was interested in
everything; but would propose no changes. What right had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), seeing
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was to give him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) so little, to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) to do this or that
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) meant on this occasion to do all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could for his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>)
happiness, but had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ordered new furniture for the whole house,
begged that every room might be fresh papered, and pointed out that
the panelling was old and must be altered, and the entire edifice
re-painted inside and out, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) would have been a happier man. <div class="bookquote">``I hope
you will find it comfortable,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) said, in a tone of voice that was
beyond measure lugubrious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure that I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``What more can any woman want
than there is here? And then there are so many comforts to which I
have never been used.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This passed between them as they stood on the steps of the house,
looking down upon green paddocks in front of the house; <div class="bookquote">``I think we
will come and see the gardens another day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps if we stay now we shall
be keeping them waiting.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then, as they returned by the road, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
remembered an account that Janet Fenwick had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) of a certain
visit which Janet had made to the vicarage as Miss Balfour, and
of all the joys of that inspection. But what right had she (<font color='blue'><b>Balfour</b></font>), Mary
Lowther, to suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Balfour</b></font>) could have any of the same pleasure?
Janet Balfour, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Balfour</b></font>) first visit to the vicarage, had been to see
the home in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Balfour</b></font>) was to live with the man to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Balfour</b></font>) whole
heart had been given without reserve.




<p/>CHAPTER LI.

<p/>THE GRINDER AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) COMRADE.


<p/>As the day drew near for the final examination at Heytesbury of the
suspected murderers,--the day on which it was expected that either
all the three prisoners, or at least two of them, would be committed
to take their trial at the summer assizes, the Vicar became anxious
as to the appearance of Carry Brattle in the Court. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
entertained an idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would go over to Salisbury and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Balfour</b></font>);
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife declared that this was imprudent and Quixotic,--and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) shouldn't do it. Fenwick's argument in support of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own
idea amounted to little more than this,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would go for the
girl because the Marquis of Trowbridge would be sure to condemn
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) for taking such a step. <div class="bookquote">``It is intolerable to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``that I should be impeded in my free action by the interference and
accusations of such an ass as that.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But the question was one on
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) wife felt herself to be so strong that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not yield,
either to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) logic or to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) anger. <div class="bookquote">``It can't be fit for you to go
about and fetch witnesses; and it won't make it more fit because
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is a pretty young woman who has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) character.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Honi soit
qui mal y pense,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife was resolute, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
gave up the plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wrote, however, to the constable at Salisbury,
begging the man to look to the young woman's comfort, and offering to
pay for any special privilege or accommodation that might be accorded
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). This occurred on the Saturday before the day on which Mary
Lowther was taken up to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) new home.

<p/>The Sunday passed by, with more or less of conversation respecting
the murder; and so also the Monday morning. The Vicar had himself
been summoned to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) evidence as to having found Sam Brattle
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own garden, in company with another man with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had
wrestled, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was able to substantiate as the Grinder; and,
indeed, the terrible bruise made by the Vicar's life-preserver on
the Grinder's back, would be proved by evidence from Lavington. On
the Monday evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was sitting, after dinner, with Gilmore, who
had dined at the vicarage, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was told that a constable from
Salisbury wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). The constable was called into the room,
and soon told his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) story. He (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) had gone up to Trotter's Buildings that
day after dinner, and was told that the bird had flown. She (<font color='blue'><b>Trotter</b></font>) had gone
out that morning, and Mrs. Stiggs knew nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) departure. When
they examined the room in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) slept, they found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had
taken what little money she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) possessed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) best clothes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had
changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) frock and put on a pair of strong boots, and taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>)
cloak with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>). Mrs. Stiggs acknowledged that had she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) seen the girl
going forth thus provided, her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) suspicions would have been aroused;
but Carry had managed to leave the house without being observed. Then
the constable went on to say that Mrs. Stiggs had told him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>)
had been sure that Carry would go. <div class="bookquote">``I've been a waiting for it all
along,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had said; <div class="bookquote">``but when there came the law rumpus atop of the
other, I knew as how she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'d hop the twig.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And now Carry Brattle had
hopped the twig, and no one knew whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had gone. There was much
sorrow at the vicarage; for Mrs. Fenwick, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had been obliged
to restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband's impetuosity in the matter, had nevertheless
wished well for the poor girl;--and who could not believe aught of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now but that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would return to misery and degradation? When the
constable was interrogated as to the need for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attendance on the
morrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) declared that nothing could now be done towards finding
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to Heytesbury in time for the magistrates'
session. He (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) supposed there would be another remand, and that then
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), too, would be--wanted.

<p/>But there had been so many remands that on the Tuesday the
magistrates were determined to commit the men, and did commit two of
them. Against Sam there was no tittle of evidence, except as to that
fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had been seen with these men in Mr. Fenwick's garden;
and it was at once proposed to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) into the witness-box, instead
of proceeding against him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) as one of the murderers. As a witness he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
was adjudged to have behaved badly; but the assumed independence of
his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) demeanour was probably the worst of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) misbehaviour. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) would
tell them nothing of the circumstances of the murder, except that
having previously become acquainted with the two men, Burrows and
Acorn, and having, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) thought, a spite against the Vicar at the
time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had determined to make free with some of the vicarage fruit.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said, met the men in the village that afternoon, and
had no knowledge of their business there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had known Acorn more
intimately than the other man, and confessed at last that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
acquaintance with that man had arisen from a belief that Acorn was
about to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) acknowledged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) knew that Burrows
had been a convicted thief, and that Acorn had been punished for
horse stealing. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) was asked how it had come to pass that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) was
desirous of seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) sister married to a horse-stealer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) declined
to answer, and, looking round the Court, said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) hoped there was
no man there who would be coward enough to say anything against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sister. They who heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declared that there was more of a threat
than a request expressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words and manner.

<p/>A question was put to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knowledge of Farmer Trumbull's
money. <div class="bookquote">``There was them as knew; but I knew nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
pressed on this point by the magistrates, but would say not a word
further. As to this, however, the police were indifferent, as they
believed that they would be able to prove at the trial, from other
sources, that the mother of the man called the Grinder had certainly
received tidings of the farmer's wealth. There were many small
matters of evidence to which the magistrates trusted. One of the men
had bought poison, and the dog had been poisoned. The presence of the
cart at the farmer's gate was proved, and the subsequent presence
of the two men in the same cart at Pycroft Common. The size of the
footprints, the characters and subsequent flight of the men, and
certain damaging denials and admissions which they themselves had
made, all went to make up the case against them, and they were
committed to be tried for the murder. Sam, however, was allowed to go
free, being served, however, with a subpoena to attend at the trial
as a witness. <div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if you send me down money enough
to bring me up from South Shields, and take me back again. I ain't a
coming on my own hook as I did this time;--and wouldn't now, only for
Muster Fenwick.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Our friends left the police to settle this question
with Sam, and then drove home to Bullhampton.

<p/>The Vicar was triumphant, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) triumph was somewhat quelled
by the disappearance of Carry Brattle. There could, however, be no
longer any doubt that Sam Brattle's innocence as to the murder was
established. Head-Constable Toffy had himself acknowledged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
that Sam could have had no hand in it. <div class="bookquote">``I told you so from the
beginning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``We `as got the right uns, at any rate,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>said the constable; <div class="bookquote">``and it wasn't none of our fault that we hadn't
'em before.''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>But though Constable Toffy was thus honest, there were
one or two in Heytesbury on that day who still persisted in declaring
that Sam was one of the murderers. Sir Thomas Charleys stuck to that
opinion to the last; and Lord Trowbridge, who had again sat upon the
bench, was quite convinced that justice was being shamefully robbed
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>) due.

<p/>When the Vicar reached Bullhampton, instead of turning into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own
place at once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) drove himself on to the mill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) dropped Gilmore at
the gate, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could not bear that the father and mother should not
know immediately, from a source which they would trust, that Sam had
been declared innocent of that great offence. Driving round by the
road, Fenwick met the miller about a quarter of a mile from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own
house. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brattle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``they have committed the two men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have they, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, not condescending to ask a
question about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I have said all along, Sam had no more to do with it than you or
I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been very good, Muster Fenwick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Mr. Brattle, do not pretend that this is not a comfort to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A comfort as my son ain't proved a murderer! If they'd a hanged `im,
Muster Fenwick, that'd a been bad, for certain. It ain't much of
comfort we has; but there may be a better and a worser in everything,
no doubt. I'm obleeged to you, all as one, Muster Fenwick--very much
obleeged; and it will take a heavy load off his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) mother's heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>Then
the Vicar turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) gig round, and drove himself home.




<p/>CHAPTER LII.

<p/>CARRY BRATTLE``S JOURNEY.


<p/>Mrs. Stiggs had been right in her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) surmise about Carry Brattle. The
confinement in Trotter's Buildings and want of interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) life
was more than the girl could bear, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had been thinking of
escape almost from the first day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had been there. Had it
not been for the mingled fear and love with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) regarded Mr.
Fenwick, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) not dreaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) should think her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) ungrateful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>)
would have flown even before the summons came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) which told her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) must appear before the magistrates and lawyers, and among a
crowd of people, in the neighbourhood of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) old home. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) could
not endure, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had flown. When it had been suggested
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) should go and live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) brother's wife as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) servant, that idea had been hard to bear. But there had been
uncertainty, and an opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) own which proved to be right,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) sister-in-law would not receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>). Now about this paper
that the policeman had handed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>), and the threatened journey to
Heytesbury, there was no uncertainty,--unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) might possibly
escape the evil by running away. Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) ran away.

<p/>The straight-going people of the world, in dealing with those who go
crooked, are almost always unreasonable. <div class="bookquote">``Because you have been bad,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>say they who are not bad to those who are bad, <div class="bookquote">``because you have
hitherto indulged yourself with all pleasures within your reach,
because you have never worked steadily or submitted yourself to
restraint, because you have been a drunkard, and a gambler, and have
lived in foul company, therefore now,--now that I have got a hold of
you and can manipulate you in reference to your repentance and future
conduct,--I will require from you a mode of life that, in its general
attractions, shall be about equal to that of a hermit in the desert.
If you flinch you are not only a monster of ingratitude towards me,
who am taking all this trouble to save you, but you are also a poor
wretch for whom no possible hope of grace can remain.''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>When it is
found that a young man is neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duties, doing nothing,
spending his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nights in billiard rooms and worse places, and getting
up at two o'clock in the day, the usual prescription of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends
is that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should lock himself up in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own dingy room, drink tea,
and spend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hours in reading good books. It is hardly recognised
that a sudden change from billiards to good books requires a strength
of character which, if possessed, would probably have kept the young
man altogether from falling into bad habits. If we left the doors of
our prisons open, and then expressed disgust because the prisoners
walked out, we should hardly be less rational. The hours at Mrs.
Stiggs's house had been frightfully heavy to poor Carry Brattle, and
at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) escaped.

<p/>It was half-past ten on the Monday morning when she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) went out. It was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) custom to go out at that hour. Mr. Fenwick had desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) to
attend the morning services at the Cathedral. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had done so for a
day or two, and had then neglected them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had still left the
house always at that time; and once, when Mrs. Stiggs had asked some
question on the subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) had replied almost in anger that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) was
not a prisoner. On this occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) made changes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) dress which
were not usual, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) was careful to avoid being seen as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) went; but had she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) been interrogated she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) would have persevered.
Who had a right to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>)?

<p/>But where should she (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) go? The reader may perhaps remember that once
when Mr. Fenwick first found this poor girl, after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flight from
home and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) great disgrace, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had expressed a desire to go to the
mill and just look at it,--even if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might do no more than that.
The same idea was now in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left the city she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
no concerted plan. There were two things between which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must
choose at once,--either to go to London, or not to go to London. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had money enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fare, and perhaps a few shillings over. In
a dim way she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did understand that the choice was between going to
the devil at once,--and not going quite at once; and then, weakly,
wistfully, with uncertain step, almost without an operation of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not take the turn which, from the end of Trotter's
Buildings, would have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to the Railway Station, but did
take that which led her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by the Three Honest Men out on to the Devizes
road,--the road which passes across Salisbury Plain, and leads from
the city to many Wiltshire villages,--of which Bullhampton is one.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) walked slowly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) walked nearly the whole day. Nothing could
be more truly tragical than the utterly purposeless tenour of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
day,--and of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whole life. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had no plan,--nothing before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>);
no object even for the evening and night of that very day in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was wasting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) strength on the Devizes road. It is the lack of
object, of all aim, in the lives of the houseless wanderers that
gives to them the most terrible element of their misery. Think of it!
To walk forth with, say, ten shillings in your pocket,--so that there
need be no instant suffering from want of bread or shelter,--and
have no work to do, no friend to see, no place to expect you, no
duty to accomplish, no hope to follow, no bourn to which you can
draw nigher,--except that bourn which, in such circumstances, the
traveller must surely regard as simply the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) weariness! But
there is nothing to which humanity cannot attune itself. Men can
live upon poison, can learn to endure absolute solitude, can bear
contumely, scorn, and shame, and never show it. Carry Brattle had
already become accustomed to misery, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) walked she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thought
more of the wretchedness of the present hour, of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) weary feet, of
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hunger, and of the nature of the rest which she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) might purchase
for herself at some poor wayside inn, than she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) future
life.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Carry Brattle.-RSB-


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) got a lump of bread and a glass of beer in the middle of the day,
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) walked on and on till the evening came. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went very
slowly, stopping often and sitting down when the road side would
afford her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) some spot of green shade. At eight o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had walked
fifteen miles, straight along the road, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew well, had
passed the turn which would have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) by the nearest way from
Salisbury to Bullhampton. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had formed no plan, but entertained a
hope that if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) continued to walk they would not catch her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) so as to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to Heytesbury on the morrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew that if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went on
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) might get to Pycroft Common by this road; and though there was no
one in the whole world whom she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hated worse than Mrs. Burrows, still
at Pycroft Common she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) might probably be taken in and sheltered. At
eight she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) reached a small village which she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) remembered to have seen
before, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) saw the name written up on a board, and which
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew to be six miles from Bullhampton. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was so tired and weary
that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could go no further, and here she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) asked for a bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) told
them that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was walking from Salisbury to the house of a friend who
lived near Devizes, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had thought she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could do it in one
day and save her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) railway fare. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was simply asked to pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
bed and supper beforehand, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was taken in and fed and
sheltered. On the next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) got up very late and was unwilling
to leave the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) paid for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) breakfast, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was
not told to go her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) way, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sat on the chair in which she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had been
placed, without speaking, almost without moving, till late in the
afternoon. At three o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) roused herself, asked for some bread
and cheese which she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) put in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pocket, and started again upon her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
journey. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would be safe, at any rate for that
day, from the magistrates and the policemen, from the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
brother, and from the presence of that other man at Heytesbury. But
whither she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would go when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) left the house,--whether on to the
hated cottage at Pycroft Common, or to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) father's house, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had
not made up her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mind when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tied on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hat. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went on along
the road towards Devizes, and about two miles from the village she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
came to a lane turning to the left, with a finger-post. On this was
written a direction,--To Bullhampton and Imber; and here she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) turned
short off towards the parish in which she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had been born. It was then
four o'clock, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had travelled a mile further she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) found
a nook under the wall of a little bridge, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) seated
herself, and ate her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) dinner of bread and cheese. While she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was there
a policeman on foot passed along the road. The man did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),
and had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seen her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would have taken no more than a policeman's
ordinary notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and in consequence did not
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hiding-place for hours.

<p/>About nine o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) crept on again, but even then her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mind was not
made up. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did not even yet know where she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would bestow herself for
that night. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) that there would be an inexpressible
pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), even in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) misery, in walking round the precincts
of the mill, in gazing at the windows of the house, in standing on
the bridge where she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had so often loitered, and in looking once more
on the scene of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) childhood. But, as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thought of this, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
remembered the darkness of the stream, and the softly-gurgling but
rapid flow with which it hurried itself on beneath the black abyss of
the building. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had often shuddered as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) watched it, indulging
herself in the luxury of causeless trepidation. But now, were she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
there, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would surely take that plunge into the blackness, which
would bring her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to the end of all her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) misery!

<p/>And yet, as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went on towards her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) old home, through the twilight,
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had no more definite idea than that of looking once more on
the place which had been cherished in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) memory through all her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
sufferings. As to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) rest for the night she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had no plan,--unless,
indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) might find her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) rest in the hidden mill-pool of that dark,
softly-gurgling stream.

<p/>On that same day, between six and seven in the evening, the miller
was told by Mr. Fenwick that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) son was no longer accused of the
murder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had not received the information in the most gracious
manner; but not the less quick was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) in making it known at the mill.
<div class="bookquote">``Them dunderheads over at He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)`tsbry has found out at last as our
Sam had now't to do with it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said, addressing no one in
particular, but in the hearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife and Fanny Brattle. Then
there came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) a torrent of questions and a torrent also of
tears. Mrs. Brattle and Fanny had both made up their minds that Sam
was innocent; but the mother had still feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would be made
to suffer in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) innocence. Fanny, however, had always
persisted that the goodness of the Lord would save him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) and them from
such injustice. To the old man himself they had hardly dared to talk
about it, but now they strove to win him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to some softness. Might not
a struggle be made to bring Sam back to the mill? But it was very
hard to soften the miller. <div class="bookquote">``After what's come and gone, the lad is
better away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) said, at last. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't think as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'d ever raised
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hand again an old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) said, shortly afterwards; <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s
kep' company with them as did. It's a`most as bad.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Beyond this
the miller would not go; but, when they separated for the night,
the mother took herself for awhile into the daughter's chamber in
order that they might weep and rejoice together. It was now all but
midsummer, and the evenings were long and sultry. The window of
Fanny's bedroom looked out on to the garden of the mill, and was but
a foot or two above the ground. This ground had once been pleasant to
them all, and profitable withal. Of late, since the miller had become
old, and Sam had grown to be too restive and self-willed to act
as desired for the general welfare of the family, but little of
pleasure, or profit either, had been forthcoming from the patch
of ground. There were a few cabbages there, and rows of untended
gooseberry and currant bushes, and down towards the orchard there was
a patch of potatoes; but no one took pride now in the garden. As for
Fanny, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could provide that there should always be a sufficient
meal on the table for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father and mother, it was as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
could do. The days were clean gone by in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had had time and
spirits to tend her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) roses, pinks, and pansies. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat at the
open window with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother, and with bated breath they spoke of the
daughter and sister that was lost to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) wouldn't take it amiss, mother, if I was to go over to
Salisbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you was to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), Fan, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'d bid you not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I wouldn't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). I wouldn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) till I was back. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was to be before the magistrates to-day. Mr. Fenwick told me so on
Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will about be the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s bolder now, mother, I fear, than what
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in old days. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was always sprightly,--speaking up to
the quality, with no fear like. Maybe it was what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said that got
them to let Sam go. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was never a coward, such as me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Fan, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d only a taken after thee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Lord, mother, makes us different for purposes of his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own. Of all
the lasses I ever see, to my eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was the comeliest.''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The old
woman couldn't speak now, but rubbed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) moist cheeks with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) raised
apron. <div class="bookquote">``I'll ask Mr. Toffy to-morrow, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>continued Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``and
if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) be still at that place in Salisbury where Mr. Fenwick put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
I'll just go to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Father won't turn me out of the house along of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn thee out, Fan! He (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>)'ll never turn thee out. What 'd a do, or what
'd I do if thee was to go away from us? If thou dost go, Fan, take
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a few bits of things that are lying there in the big press, and
'll never be used other gait. I warrant the poor child 'll be but
badly off for under-clothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div><p/>And then they planned how the journey on the morrow should be
made,--after the constable should have been questioned, and the Vicar
should have been consulted. Fanny would leave home immediately after
breakfast, and when the miller should ask after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at dinner his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
wife should tell him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) daughter had gone to Salisbury. If
further question should be asked,--and it was thought possible that
no further question would be asked, as the father would then guess
the errand on which his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter would have gone,--but if the subject
were further mooted, Mrs. Brattle, with such courage as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) might be
able to assume, should acknowledge the business that had taken Fanny
to Salisbury. Then there arose questions about money. Mr. Fenwick had
owned, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might thereby ease the mother's heart, that
for the present Carry was maintained by him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). To take this task upon
themselves the mother and daughter were unable. The money which they
had in hand, very small in amount, was, they knew, the property of
the head of the family. That they could do no permanent good to Carry
was a great grief. But it might be something if they could comfort
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for awhile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think but what her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart 'll still be soft to thee, Fan; and
who knows but what it may bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) round to see thy face, and hear
thy voice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Fanny heard a sound in the garden, and stretched her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
head and shoulders quickly out of the window. They had been late at
the mill that evening, and it was now eleven o'clock. It had been
still daylight when the miller had left them at tea; but the night
had crept on them as they had sat there. There was no moon, but there
was still something left of the reflection of the last colours of
the setting sun, and the night was by no means dark. Fanny saw at
once the figure of a woman, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not at once recognise the
person of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother! oh, mother! oh, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a
voice from the night; and in a moment Carry Brattle had stretched
herself so far within the window that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had grasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother by
the arm.




<p/>CHAPTER LIII.

<p/>THE FATTED CALF.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration-RSB-

<p/>Mrs. Brattle, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) daughter's voice, was so confounded,
dismayed, and frightened, that for awhile she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could give no direction
as to what should be done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had screamed at first, having some dim
idea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) mind that the form she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) saw was not of living flesh and
blood. And Carry herself had been hardly more composed or mistress of
herself than her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had strayed thither, never having quite
made up her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mind to any settled purpose. From the spot in which she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
had hidden herself under the bridge when the policeman passed her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
had started when the evening sun was setting, and had wandered on
slowly till the old familiar landmarks of the parish were reached.
And then she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) came to the river, and looking across could just see
the eaves of the mill through the willows by the last gloaming of
the sunlight. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) stood and paused, and every now and again had
crept on a few feet as her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) courage came to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), and at last, by the
well known little path, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had crept down behind the mill, crossing
the stream by the board which had once been so accustomed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
feet, and had made her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) way into the garden and had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mother
and sister as they talked together at the open window. Any idea which
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had hitherto entertained of not making herself known to them at
the mill,--of not making herself known at any rate to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mother and
sister,--left her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) at once at that moment. There had been upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
a waking dream, a horrid dream, that the waters of the mill-stream
might flow over her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) head, and hide her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wickedness and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) misery
from the eyes of men; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had stood and shuddered as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) saw the
river; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had never really thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) own strength would
suffice for that termination to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) sorrows. It was more probable
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would be doomed to lie during the night beneath a hedge, and
then perish of the morning cold! But now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) heard the voices at
the window, there could be no choice for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) but that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) should make
herself known,--not though her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) father should kill her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).

<p/>Even Fanny was driven beyond the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) composure by the
strangeness of this advent. <div class="bookquote">``Carry! Carry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) exclaimed over and
over again, not aloud,--and indeed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) voice was never loud,--but
with bated wonder. The two sisters held each other by the hand, and
Carry's other hand still grasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother's arm. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, I am
so tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, I think that I shall die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My child;--my poor child. What shall we do, Fan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But your father--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We couldn't turn her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) away from the very window, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) like that,
mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't turn me away, Fanny. Dear Fanny, do not turn me away,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said
Carry, striving to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister by the other hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Carry, we will not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, trying to settle her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind to
some plan of action. Any idea of keeping the thing long secret from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not entertain; but for this night
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) resolved at last that shelter should be given to the discarded
daughter without the father's knowledge. But even in doing this there
would be difficulty. Carry must be brought in through the window, as
any disturbance at the front of the house would arouse the miller.
And then Mrs. Brattle must be made to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) own room, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
absence would create suspicion and confusion. Fanny, too, had
terrible doubts as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother's powers of going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bed and
lying there without revealing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) husband that some cause of great
excitement had arisen. And then it might be that the miller would
come to his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) daughter's room, and insist that the outcast should be
made an outcast again, even in the middle of the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>outcast</b></font>) was a man
so stern, so obstinate, so unforgiving, so masterful, that Fanny,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would face any danger as regarded herself, knew that
terrible things might happen. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that Carry was very
weak. If their father came to them in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrath, might she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not die in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) despair? Nevertheless it was necessary that something should be
done. <div class="bookquote">``We must let her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) get in at the window, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It
won't do, nohow, to unbar the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) outright! Oh, Carry; oh, my child. I
dunna know as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can get in along of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) weakness.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But Carry was
not so tired as that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been in and out of that window scores
of times; and now, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heard that the permission was accorded
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother's arms. <div class="bookquote">``My
own Carry, my own bairn;--my girl, my darling.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>And the poor mother
satisfied the longings of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart with infinite caresses.

<p/>Fanny in the meantime had crept out to the kitchen, and now returned
with food in a plate and cold tea. <div class="bookquote">``My girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you must eat
a bit, and then we will have you to bed. When the morn comes, we must
think about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny, you was always the best that there ever was,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said Carry,
speaking from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother's bosom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>continued Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``you must creep off. Indeed you
must, or of course father'll wake up. And mother, don't say a word
to-morrow when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rises. I'll go to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in the mill myself. That'll
be best.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>Then, with longings that could hardly be repressed, with
warm, thick, clinging kisses, with a hot, rapid, repeated assurance
that everything,--everything had been forgiven, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own Carry
was once more her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own, own Carry, the poor mother allowed herself
to be banished. There seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to be such a world of cruelty
in the fact that Fanny might remain for the whole of that night
with the dear one who had returned to them, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must be sent
away,--perhaps not to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) again if the storm in the morning
should rise too loudly! Fanny, with great craft, accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
mother to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) room, so that if the old man should speak she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might
be there to answer;--but the miller slept soundly after his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) day of
labour, and never stirred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) do to me, Fan?''  (<font color='red'><b>the wanderer</b></font>)</div>the wanderer asked as soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
sister returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think of it now, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, softened almost as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
mother was softened by the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kill me, Fan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will not lay a hand upon you. It is his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) words that are
so rough! Carry, Carry, will you be good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, dear; indeed I will. I have not been bad since Mr. Fenwick
came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister,--if you will be good, I will never leave you. My heart's
darling, my beauty, my pretty one! Carry, you shall be the same to
me as always, if you'll be good. I'll never cast it up again you, if
you'll be good.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), too, filled herself full, and satisfied
the hungry craving of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) love with the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) caresses. <div class="bookquote">``But
thee'll be famished, lass. I'll see thee eat a bit, and then I'll put
thee comfortable to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Carry Brattle was famished, and ate the bread and bacon which
were set before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and drank the cold tea, with an appetite which
was perhaps unbecoming the romance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) position. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister stood
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), cutting a slice now and then from the loaf, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had taken nothing, smoothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hair, and wishing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
sake that the fire were better. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afeard of father, Fan,--awfully;
but for all that, it's the sweetest meal as I've had since I left the
mill.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>Then Fanny was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knees beside the returned profligate,
covering even the dear one's garments with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) kisses.

<p/>It was late before Fanny laid herself down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister's side that
night. <div class="bookquote">``Carry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) whispered when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister was undressed, <div class="bookquote">``will
you kneel here and say your prayers as you used to?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Carry, without a
word, did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was bidden, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
sister's lap. No word was spoken out loud, but Fanny was satisfied
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister had been in earnest. <div class="bookquote">``Now sleep, my darling;--and
when I've just tidied your things for the morning, I will be with
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>The wanderer</b></font>)</div>The wanderer again obeyed, and in a few moments the work of the
past two days befriended her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was asleep. Then the sister
went to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) task with the soiled frock and the soiled shoes, and
looked up things clean and decent for the morrow. It would be at any
rate well that Carry should appear before her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) father without the
stain of the road upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).

<p/>As the lost one lay asleep there, with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) soft ringlets all loose
upon the pillow, still beautiful, still soft, lovely though an
outcast from the dearest rights of womanhood, with so much of
innocence on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brow, with so much left of the grace of childhood
though the glory of the flower had been destroyed by the unworthy
hand that had ravished its sweetness, Fanny, sitting in the corner
of the room over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) work, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eye from moment to moment turned
upon the sleeper, could not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind from wandering away in
thoughts on the strange destiny of woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew that there had
been moments in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) great love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister had
been tinged with envy. No young lad had ever waited in the dusk to
hear the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) footfall; no half-impudent but half-bashful
glances had ever been thrown after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went through the
village on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) business. To be a homely, household thing, useful
indeed in this world, and with high hopes for the future,--but still
to be a drudge; that had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) destiny. There was never a woman
to whom the idea of being loved was not the sweetest thought that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind could produce. Fate had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) plain, and no man had
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). The same chance had made Carry pretty,--the belle of the
village, the acknowledged beauty of Bullhampton. And there she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lay,
a thing said to be so foul that even a father could not endure to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) name mentioned in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ears! And yet, how small had been
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fault compared with other crimes for which men and women are
forgiven speedily, even if it has been held that pardon has ever been
required.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) came over, and knelt down and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brow; and
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did so she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) swore to herself that by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), even in the inmost
recesses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bosom, Carry should never be held to be evil, to be a
castaway, to be one of whom, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister, it would behove her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be
ashamed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had told Carry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would <div class="bookquote">``never cast it up against
her (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now resolved that there should be no such casting up even
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own judgment. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), too, been fair, might not she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) also have
fallen?

<p/>At five o'clock on the following morning the miller went out from the
house to his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) mill, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) daily practice. Fanny heard his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
heavy step, heard the bar withdrawn, heard the shutters removed from
the kitchen window, and knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father was as yet in ignorance
of the inmate who had been harboured. Fanny at once arose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
bed, careful not to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) companion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had thought it all
out, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have Carry ready dressed for an escape, should
it be that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father would demand imperiously that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should be
sent adrift from the mill, or whether it might not be better that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
should be able to plead at the first moment that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister was in
bed, tired, asleep,--at any rate undressed,--and that some little
time must be allowed. Might it not be that even in that hour her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
father's heart might be softened? But she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must lose no time in going
to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The hired man who now tended the mill with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father came
always at six, and that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must be said with
no ear to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own. It would have been impossible even
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter before a stranger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) slipped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) clothes on, therefore, and within ten minutes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father's
departure followed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) into the mill.

<p/>The old man had gone aloft, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slow, heavy feet as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was moving the sacks which were above her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) considered for a
moment, and thinking it better that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should not herself ascend the
little ladder,--knowing that it might be well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should have
the power of instant retreat to the house,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) called to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from
below. <div class="bookquote">``What's wanted now?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>demanded the old man as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Father, I must speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Father, you must come
down to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came down slowly, without a word, and stood
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) waiting to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tidings. <div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there is
some one in the house, and I have come to tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sam has come, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could see that there was a
sparkle of joy in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke. Oh, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could only make the
return of that other child as grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as would have been the
return of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, father; it isn't Sam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who be it, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, and the colour and bearing
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face were changed as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked the question. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw at once
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had guessed the truth. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't--it isn't--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father; it is Carry.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) came close to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
and strove to take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thrust both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pockets and turned himself half away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is our
flesh and blood; you will not turn against her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has come
back to us, and is sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) faults.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is a--''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) other daughter had stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
hand before the word had been uttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, who among us has not done wrong at times?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has disgraced my gray hairs, and made me a reproach and a shame.
I will not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). Bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) begone. I will not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) or look
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). How came she (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) there? When did she (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Fanny told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father the whole story,--everything as it
occurred, and did not forget to add her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own conviction that Carry's
life had been decent in all respects since the Vicar had found a home
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in Salisbury. <div class="bookquote">``You would not have it go on like that, father.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is naught to our parson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will pay. As long as there is a shilling left, I will pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) shall not live on the charity of any man, whether parson or no
parson. But I will not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). While she (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) be here you may just send
me my vittels to the mill. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) be not gone afore night, I will
sleep here among the sacks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) till the labourer came, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) returned to
the house, having failed as yet to touch his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went back and
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) story to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother, and then a part of it to Carry who was
still in bed. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother by Carry's bedside,
and had to wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could separate them before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could tell
any story to either. <div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) say of me, Fan?''  (<font color='red'><b>the sinner</b></font>)</div>asked the poor
sinner. <div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) say that I must go? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) never speak to me again?
I will just throw myself into the mill-race and have done with it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to rise and dress herself, but to remain where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was. It could not be expected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, but that their father
would be hard to persuade. <div class="bookquote">``I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) will kill me when he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) sees
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carry.

<p/>At eight o'clock Fanny took the old man his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breakfast to the mill,
while Mrs. Brattle waited on Carry, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had deserved all
the good things which a mother could do for a child. The miller sat
upon a sack at the back of the building, while the hired man took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
meal of bread and cheese in the front, and Fanny remained close at
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow. While the old man was eating she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was very slow, and sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the morsel of sky
which was visible through the small aperture, thinking evidently of
anything but the food that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was swallowing. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned
the empty bowl and plate to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were about at
once to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work. Hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not uttered a single word
since she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``think of it. Is it not good to have mercy and to
forgive? Would you drive your girl out again upon the streets?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The miller still did not speak, but turned his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) face round upon his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
daughter with a gaze of such agony that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) threw herself on the sack
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>), and clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were such as thee, Fan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were such as
thee!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then again he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) face that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) might not see the
tear that was forcing itself into the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) eye.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) moved. His (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) companion in the
mill did not come near them, knowing, as the poor do know on such
occasions, there was something going on which would lead them to
prefer that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) should be absent. The words that were said between
them were not very many; but at the end of the hour Fanny returned to
the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Carry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``father is coming in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looks at me, it will kill me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Carry.

<p/>Mrs. Brattle was so lost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) hopes and fears that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) knew not
what to do, or how to bestow herself. A minute had hardly passed
when the miller's step was heard, and Carry knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was in the
presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been sitting, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) rose, and
went to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and knelt at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if I may bide with you,--if I may bide with
you--.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) voice was lost in sobbing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could make no
promise as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) future conduct.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``If I may bide with you,--if I may bide
with you.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may stay with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>the father said, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eldest
daughter; <div class="bookquote">``but I shall never be able to show my face again about the
parish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had uttered no words of forgiveness to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter, nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
bestowed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) any kiss. Fanny had raised her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was on the
ground at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feet, and had made her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) seat herself apart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In all the whole warld,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, looking round upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife and
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) elder child, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uttered the words, and
speaking with an emphasis that was terrible to the hearers, <div class="bookquote">``there
is no thing so vile as a harlot.''  (<font color='red'><b>the hearers</b></font>)</div>All the dreaded fierceness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
manner had then come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and neither of them had dared to
answer him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). After that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at once went back to the mill, and to Fanny
who followed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) vouchsafed to repeat the permission that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
daughter should be allowed to remain beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) roof.

<p/>Between twelve and one she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) again went to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dinner. At
first he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not come, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was busy, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would eat a morsel, where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was, in the mill. But Fanny argued
the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it always to be so, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know. What matters it, so as I have strength to do a turn
of work?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must not be that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) presence should drive you from the house.
Think of mother, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will suffer. Father, you must come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) allowed himself to be led into the house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
accustomed chair, and ate his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dinner in gloomy silence. But after
dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell `ee, lass, I do not want the pipe to-day. Now't has got
itself done. D'ye think as grist 'll grind itself without hands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When Carry said that it would be better than this that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should go
again, Fanny told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to remember that evil things could not be cured
in a day. With the mother that afternoon was, on the whole, a happy
time, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lost child's hand within her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own. Late in
the evening, when the miller returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) rest, Carry moved about
the house softly, resuming some old task to which in former days she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had been accustomed; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did so the miller's eyes would wander
round the room after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) did not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) on that day,
nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) pronounce her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) name.

<p/>Two other circumstances which bear upon our story occurred at the
mill that afternoon. After their tea, at which the miller did not
make his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) appearance, Fanny Brattle put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) bonnet and ran across
the fields to the vicarage. After all the trouble that Mr. Fenwick
had taken, it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) thought, necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) should be told what
had happened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the best news,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I have heard this many a
day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew that you would be glad to hear that the poor child has found
her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) home again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>Then Fanny told the whole story,--how Carry had
escaped from Salisbury, being driven to do so by fear of the law
proceedings at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been summoned to attend, how her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father
had sworn that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not yield, and how at length he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had yielded.
When Fanny told the Vicar and Mrs. Fenwick that the old man had as
yet not spoken to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter, they both desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be of good
cheer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will come, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) once be allowed

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it will come,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``In a week or two you will
find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) favourite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was the favourite with us all, sir, once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``and may

to be loved. You'll come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), Mr. Fenwick, some day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Fenwick promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would, and Fanny returned to the mill.

<p/>The other circumstance was the arrival of Constable Toffy at the mill
during Fanny's absence. In the course of the day news had travelled
into the village that Carry Brattle was again at the mill;--and
Constable Toffy, who in regard to the Brattle family, was somewhat
discomfited by the transactions of the previous day at Heytesbury,
heard the news. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) was aware,--being in that respect more capable
than Lord Trowbridge of receiving enlightenment,--that the result
of all the inquiries made, in regard to the murder, did, in truth,
contain no tittle of evidence against Sam. As constables go,
Constable Toffy was a good man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) would be wronged if it were to
be said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) regretted Sam's escape; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) nature was as
is the nature of constables, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) could not rid himself of that
feeling of disappointment which always attends baffled efforts. And
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) saw that there was no evidence against Sam, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) did not,
therefore, necessarily think that the young man was innocent. It may
be doubted whether, to the normal policeman's mind, any man is ever
altogether absolved of any crime with which that man's name has
been once connected. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt, therefore, somewhat sore against the
Brattles;--and then there was the fact that Carry Brattle, who had
been regularly <div class="bookquote">``subpoenaed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carry Brattle/Carry</b></font>)</div>had kept herself out of the way,--most
flagitiously, illegally and damnably. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had run off from Salisbury,
just as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) were a free person to do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) pleased with
herself, and not subject to police orders! When, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) heard
that Carry was at the mill,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) having made herself liable to some
terribly heavy fine by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) contumacy,--it was manifestly his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) duty to
see after her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was wanted.

<p/>At the mill he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) saw only the miller himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) visit was not
altogether satisfactory. Old Brattle, who understood very little of
the case, but who did understand that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) own son had been made clear
in reference to that accusation, had no idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) daughter had
any concern with that matter, other than what had fallen to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lot
in reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brother. When, therefore, Toffy inquired after
Caroline Brattle, and desired to know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was at the mill,
and also was anxious to be informed why she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had not attended at
Heytesbury in accordance with the requirements of the law, the miller
turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) and declared that if anybody said a word against Sam
Brattle in reference to the murder,--the magistrates having settled
that matter,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), Jacob Brattle, old as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was, would <div class="bookquote">``see it out''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with that malignant slanderer. Constable Toffy did his (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) best to make
the matter clear to the miller, but failed utterly. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) a warrant
to search for anybody? Toffy had no warrant. Toffy only desired to
know whether Caroline Brattle was or was not beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father's
roof. The old miller, declaring to himself that, though his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) child had
shamed him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) would not deny her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was again one of the
family, acknowledged so much, but refused the constable admittance to
the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Mr. Brattle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>said the constable, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was subpoenaed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know now't o' that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>answered the miller, not deigning to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>)
face round to his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) antagonist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you know, Mr. Brattle, the law must have its course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. And it ain't law as you should come here a hindering o'
me; and it ain't law as you should walk that unfortunate young woman
off with you to prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s wanted, Mr. Brattle;--not in the way of going to prison,
but before the magistrates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a deal of things is wanted as ain't to be had. Anyways, you
ain't no call to my house now, and as them as is there is in trouble,
I'll ax you to be so kind as--as just to leave us alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Toffy/Mr. Toffy</b></font>)</div><p/>Toffy, pretending that he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) was satisfied with the information
received, and merely adding that Caroline Brattle must certainly,
at some future time, be made to appear before the magistrates at
Heytesbury, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Toffy</b></font>) departure with more good-humour than the miller
deserved from him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>), and returned to the village.




<p/>CHAPTER LIV.

<p/>MR. GILMORE``S RUBIES.


<p/>Mary Lowther struggled hard for a week to reconcile herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
new fate, and at the end of the week had very nearly given way. The
gloom which had fallen upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) acted upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) lover and then reacted
upon herself. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) have been light in hand, could he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) have talked
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) about ordinary subjects, could he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) have behaved towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
with any even of the light courtesies of the every-day lover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
would have been better able to fight her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) battle. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) there was a something in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) manner which always seemed to
accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was giving so much, would give him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
nothing in return. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) did not complain in words. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) did not wilfully
resent her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) coldness to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) looked, and walked, and spoke,
and seemed to imply by every deed that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was conscious of being an
injured man. At the end of the week he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) a handsome present,
and in receiving it she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had to assume some pleasure. But the failure
was complete, and each of the two knew how great was the failure. Of
course, there would be other presents. And he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had already,--already,
though no allusion to the day for the marriage had yet been
made,--begun to press on for those changes in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) house for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
would not ask, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was determined to effect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) comfort.
There had been another visit to the house and gardens, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) that this should be done,--unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) objected; and that
that other change should be made, if it were not opposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
wishes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) made an attempt to be enthusiastic,--enthusiastic on the
wrong side, to be zealous to save him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) money, and the whole morning
was beyond measure sad and gloomy. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) asked herself whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
meant to go through with it. If not, the sooner that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) retreated
and hid herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) disgrace for the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) life the better.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) at last, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had been made to believe
that by doing so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would benefit him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), and because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had taught
herself to think that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) duty to disregard herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had
thought of herself till she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was sick of the subject. What did it
matter,--about herself,--as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could be of some service to
some one? And so thinking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had
begun to fear that were she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to marry this man she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could not be of
service to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And when the thing should be done,--if ever it were
done,--there would be no undoing it. Would not her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) life be a life
of sin if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) were to live as the wife of a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) did not
love,--while, perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would be unable not to love another man?

<p/>Nothing of all this was told to the Vicar, but Mrs. Fenwick knew what
was going on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend's mind, and spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own very freely.
<div class="bookquote">``Hitherto,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have given you credit all through for good
conduct and good feeling; but I shall be driven to condemn you if
you now allow a foolish, morbid, sickly idea to interfere with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
happiness and your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what if I can do nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) happiness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is nonsense. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is not a man whom you despise or dislike.
If you will only meet him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) half-way you will soon find that your
sympathies will grow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There never will be a spark of sympathy between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary, that is most horribly wicked. What you mean is this, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is not light and gay as a lover. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) remembers the
occurrences of the last six months. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) cannot be so happy
as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might have been had Walter Marrable never been at Loring. There
must be something to be conquered, something to be got over, after
such an episode. But you may set your face against doing that, or you
may strive to do it. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) sake, if not for your own, the struggle
should be made.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man may struggle to draw a loaded wagon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't move it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The load in this case is of your own laying on. One hour of frank
kindness on your part would dispel his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gloom. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not gloomy by
nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mary Lowther tried to achieve that hour of frank kindness and
again failed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) failed and was conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) failure, and there
came a time,--and that within three weeks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) engagement,--in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had all but made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) mind to return the ring which he (<font color='blue'><b>GILMORE</b></font>)
had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), and to leave Bullhampton for ever. Could it be right
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) should marry a man that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) did not love?

<p/>That was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) argument with herself, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was deterred from
doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) contemplated by a circumstance which could have had no
effect on that argument. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) Aunt Marrable the
following letter, in which was certainly no word capable of making
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) think that now, at last, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could love the man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had
promised to marry. And yet this letter so affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) told
herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would go on and become the wife of Harry Gilmore.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would struggle yet again, and force herself to succeed. The
wagon, no doubt, was heavily laden, but still, with sufficient
labour, it might perhaps be moved.

<p/>Miss Marrable had been asked to go over to Dunripple, when Mary
Lowther went to Bullhampton. It had been long since she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had been
there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had not thought ever to make such a visit. But there
came letters, and there were rejoinders,--which were going on before
Mary's departure,--and at last it was determined that Miss Marrable
should go to Dunripple, and pay a visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) cousin. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did
not do this till long after Walter Marrable had left the place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
had written to Mary soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arrival, and in this first letter
there had been no word about Walter; but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) second letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
spoke very freely of Walter Marrable,--as the reader shall see.


<p/>Dunripple, 2nd July, 1868.

<p/>DEAR MARY,

<p/>I got your letter on Saturday, and cannot help wishing
that it had been written in better spirits. However, I do
not doubt but that it will all come right soon. I am quite
sure that the best thing you can do is to let Mr. Gilmore
name an early day. Of course you never intended that there
should be a long engagement. Such a thing, where there is
no possible reason for it, must be out of the question.
And it will be much better to take advantage of the fine
weather than to put it off till the winter has nearly
come. Fix some day in August or early in September. I am
sure you will be much happier married than you are single;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) will be gratified, which is, I suppose, to count
for something.

<p/>I am very happy here, but yet I long to get home. At my
time of life, one must always be strange among strangers.
Nothing can be kinder than Sir Gregory, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) sort of
fashion. Gregory Marrable, the son, is, I fear, in a
bad way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) father, and laughs at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own
ailments, but everybody in the house,--except perhaps Sir
Gregory,--knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) is very ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) never comes down
at all now, but lives in two rooms, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) has together
up-stairs. We go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) every day, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) is hardly
able to talk to any one. Sir Gregory never mentions the
subject to me, but Mrs. Brownlow is quite confident that
if anything were to happen to Gregory Marrable, Walter
would be asked to come to Dunripple as the heir, and to
give up the army altogether.

<p/>I get on very well with Mrs. Brownlow, but of course we
cannot be like old friends. Edith is a very nice girl,
but rather shy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) never talks about herself, and is too
silent to be questioned. I do not, however, doubt for a
moment but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) will be Walter Marrable's wife. I
think it likely that they are not engaged as yet, as in
that case I think Mrs. Brownlow would tell me; but many
things have been said which leave on my mind a conviction
that it will be so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is to be here again in August, and
from the way in which Mrs. Brownlow speaks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) coming,
there is no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) expects it. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) paid great
attention to Edith when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was here before, I am quite
sure; and I take it he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is only waiting till--


<p/>In writing so far, Miss Marrable had intended to signify that Captain
Marrable had been slow to ask Edith Brownlow to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wife while he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
was at Dunripple, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could not bring himself so soon to show
himself indifferent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) former love; but that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would not
hesitate, knowing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would know, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) former love had bestowed
herself elsewhere; but in this there would have been a grievous
accusation against Mary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was therefore compelled to fill up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sentence in some other form;--


<p/>till things should have arranged themselves a little.

<p/>And it will be all for the best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is a very nice,
quiet, lady-like girl, and so great a favourite with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
uncle, that should his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) son die before him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) great
object in life will be her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) welfare. Walter Marrable, as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband, would live at Dunripple, just as though the
place were his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own. And indeed there would be no one
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) and the property except his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own father. Some
arrangement could be made as to buying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) life
interest,--for which indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) has taken the money
beforehand with a vengeance,--and then Walter would be
settled for life. Would not this be all for the best?

<p/>I shall go home about the 14th. They want me to stay,
but I shall have been away quite long enough. I don't
know whether people ought to go from home at all after a
certain age. I get cross because I can't have the sort of
chair I like to sit on; and then they don't put any green
tea into the pot, and I don't like to ask to have any
made, as I doubt whether they have any green tea in the
house. And I find it bad to be among invalids with whom,
indeed, I can sympathise, but for whom I cannot pretend
that I feel any great affection. As we grow old we become
incapable of new tenderness, and rather resent the calls
that are made upon us for pity. The luxury of devotion to
misery is as much the privilege of the young as is that of
devotion to love.

<p/>Write soon, dearest; and remember that the best news
I can have, will be tidings as to the day fixed for
your marriage. And remember, too, that I won't have any
question about your being married at Bullhampton. It would
be quite improper. He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) must come to Loring; and I needn't
say how glad I shall be to see the Fenwicks. Parson John
will expect to marry you, but Mr. Fenwick might come and
assist.

<p/>Your most affectionate aunt,

<p/>SARAH MARRABLE.


<p/>It was not the entreaty made by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) aunt that an early day should
be fixed for the marriage which made Mary Lowther determine that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would yet once more attempt to drag the wagon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could have
withstood such entreaty as that, and, had the letter gone no further,
would probably have replied to it by saying that no day could be
fixed at all. But, with the letter there came an assurance that
Walter Marrable had forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), was about to marry Edith Brownlow,
and that therefore all ideas of love and truth and sympathy and joint
beating of mutual hearts, with the rest of it, might be thrown to the
winds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) would marry Harry Gilmore, and take care that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had good
dinners, and would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) mind to flannel petticoats and coal for
the poor of Bullhampton, and would altogether come down from the
pedestal which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had once striven to erect for herself. From that
high but tottering pedestal, propped up on shafts of romance and
poetry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) would come down; but there would remain for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) the
lower, firmer standing block, of which duty was the sole support. It
was no doubt most unreasonable that any such change should come upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) in consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) aunt's letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had never for a moment
told herself that Walter Marrable could ever be anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>),
since that day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) own deed liberated him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) troth; and, indeed, had done more than that, had forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) to
accept that liberation. Why then should his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) engagement with another
woman have any effect with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) either in one direction or in the
other? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself had submitted to a new engagement,--had done so
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had shown any sign of being fickle. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not therefore
be angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). And yet, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could be fickle, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
could do that very thing which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had openly declared her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) purpose of
doing, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) persuaded herself,--for a week or two,--that any sacrifice
made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would be a sacrifice to folly, and a neglect of duty.

<p/>At this time, during this week or two, there came to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) direct from
the jewellers in London, a magnificent set of rubies,--ear-rings,
brooch, bracelets, and necklace. The rubies she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen before, and
knew that they had belonged to Mr. Gilmore's mother. Mrs. Fenwick had
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) that the setting was so old that no lady could wear them
now, and there had been a presentiment that they would be forthcoming
in a new form. Mary had said that, of course, such ornaments as these
would come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands only when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) became Mrs. Gilmore. Mrs.
Fenwick had laughed and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not understand the
romantic generosity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) lover. And now the jewellery had come to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) at the parsonage without a word from Gilmore, and was spread out
in its pretty cases on the vicarage drawing-room table. Now, if ever,
must she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could not do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had promised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, <div class="bookquote">``you must go up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to-morrow, and tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) how noble he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary waited, perhaps, for a whole minute before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
would willingly have given the jewels away for ever and ever, so that
they might not have been there now to trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did answer
at last, knowing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did so, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) last chance was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is noble,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, slowly; <div class="bookquote">``and I will go and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so. I'll
go now, if it is not too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do, do. You'll be sure to find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Fenwick, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
enthusiasm, embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>).

<p/>Mary put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hat and walked off at once through the garden and
across the fields, and into the Privets; and close to the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
met her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lover. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) step, and then
turned short round, almost as though fearing something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``those jewels have come. Oh, dear. They are not
mine yet. Why did you have them sent to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something in the word yet, or in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tone as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke it,
which made his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) heart leap as it had never leaped before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they're not yours, I don't know whom they belong to,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said.
And his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) eye was bright, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) voice almost shook with emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you doing anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing on earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come and see them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So they walked off, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), at any rate, on that occasion was a happy
lover. For a few minutes,--perhaps for an hour,--he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) did allow himself
to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was destined to enjoy that rapture of requited
affection, in longing for which his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) very soul had become sick. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
walked back with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to the vicarage her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand rested heavily on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
arm, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) some question about his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) land, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
able so to modulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) voice as to make him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
learning to regard his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) interests as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at the
gate leading into the vicarage garden, and once more made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) an
assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) regard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if love will beget love, I think that you must love
me at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arm still more closely. But
even then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not bring herself to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did love
him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER LV.

<p/>GLEBE LAND.


<p/>The fifteenth of July was a Sunday, and it had been settled for some
time past that on this day Mr. Puddleham would preach for the first
time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) new chapel. The building had been hurried on through the
early summer in order that this might be achieved; and although the
fittings were not completed, and the outward signs of the masons and
labourers had not been removed,--although the heaps of mortar were
still there, and time had not yet sufficed to have the chips cleared
away,--on Sunday the fifteenth of July the chapel was opened. Great
efforts were made to have it filled on the occasion. The builder
from Salisbury came over with all his (<font color='blue'><b>builder</b></font>) family, not deterred by the
consideration that whereas the Puddlehamites of Bullhampton were
Primitive Methodists, he (<font color='blue'><b>builder</b></font>) was a regular Wesleyan. And many in the
parish were got to visit the chapel on this the day of its glory, who
had less business there than even the builder from Salisbury. In most
parishes there are some who think it well to let the parson know that
they are independent and do not care for him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>), though they profess
to be of his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) flock; and then, too, the novelty of the thing had its
attraction, and the well-known fact that the site chosen for the
building had been as gall and wormwood to the parson and his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) family.
These causes together brought a crowd to the vicarage-gate on that
Sunday morning, and it was quite clear that the new chapel would be
full, and that Mr. Puddleham's first Sunday would be a success. And
the chapel, of course, had a bell,--a bell which was declared by Mrs.
Fenwick to be the hoarsest, loudest, most unmusical, and ill-founded
miscreant of a bell that was ever suspended over a building for the
torture of delicate ears. It certainly was a loud and brazen bell;
but Mr. Fenwick expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) opinion that there was nothing amiss
with it. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife declared that it sounded as though it came
from the midst of the shrubs at their own front gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) reminded
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that their own church bells sounded as though they came from the
lower garden. That one sound should be held by them to be musical
and the other abominable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) declared to be a prejudice. Then there
was a great argument about the bells, in which Mrs. Fenwick, and
Mary Lowther, and Harry Gilmore were all against the Vicar. And,
throughout the discussion, it was known to them all that there were
no ears in the parish to which the bells were so really odious as
they were to the ears of the Vicar himself. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) heart of hearts
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) hated the chapel, and, in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) endeavours to the
contrary, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) feelings towards Mr. Puddleham were not those which
the Christian religion requires one neighbour to bear to another.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) made the struggle, and for some weeks past had not said a
word against Mr. Puddleham. In regard to the Marquis the thing was
different. The Marquis should have known better, and against the
Marquis he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did say a great many words.

<p/>They began to ring the bell on that Sunday morning before ten
o'clock. Mrs. Fenwick was still sitting at the breakfast-table, with
the windows open, when the sound was first heard,--first heard, that
is, on that morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) looked at Mary, groaned, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) hands
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) ears. The Vicar laughed, and walked about the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At what time do they begin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till eleven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick. <div class="bookquote">``There, it wants a quarter to
ten now, and they mean to go on with that music for an hour and a
quarter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be keeping them company by-and-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The poor old church bells won't be heard through it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Fenwick.

<p/>Mrs. Fenwick was in the habit of going to the village school for half
an hour before the service on Sunday mornings, and on this morning
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) started from the house according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) custom at a little after
ten. Mary Lowther went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), and as the school was in the village
and could be reached much more shortly by the front gate than by the
path round by the church, the two ladies walked out boldly before the
new chapel. The reader may perhaps remember that Mrs. Fenwick had
promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband to withdraw that outward animosity to the chapel
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had evinced by not using the vicarage entrance. As they
went there was a crowd collected, and they found that after the
manner of the Primitive Methodists in their more enthusiastic days,
a procession of worshippers had been formed in the village, which at
this very moment was making its way to the chapel. Mrs. Fenwick, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) stood aside to make way for them, declared that the bell sounded
as though it were within her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) bonnet. When they reached the school
they found that many a child was absent who should have been there,
and Mrs. Fenwick knew that the truant urchins were amusing themselves
at the new building. And with those who were not truant the clang of
the new bell distracted terribly that attention which was due to the
collect. Mrs. Fenwick herself confessed afterwards that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) hardly
knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was teaching.

<p/>Mr. Fenwick, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) habit, went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own study when the
ladies went to the school, and there, according to custom also on
Sunday mornings, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) letters were brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), some few minutes
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) started on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) walk through the garden to the church. On
this morning there were a couple of letters for himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
opened them both. One was from a tradesman in Salisbury, and the
other was from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife's brother-in-law, Mr. Quickenham. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
started he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) read Mr. Quickenham's letter, and then did his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) best to
forget it and put it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) mind till the morning service should
be over. The letter was as follows:--


<p/>Pump Court, June 30, 1868.

<p/>DEAR FENWICK,

<p/>I have found, as I thought I should, that Lord Trowbridge
has no property in, or right whatever to, the bit of
ground on which your enemies have been building their new
Ebenezer. The spot is a part of the glebe, and as such
seems to have been first abandoned by a certain parson
named Brandon, who was your predecessor's predecessor.
There can, however, be no doubt that the ground is glebe,
and that you are bound to protect it as such, on behalf of
your successors, and of the patrons of the living.

<p/>I found some difficulty in getting at the terrier of the
parish,--which you, who consider yourself to be a model
parson, I dare say, have never seen. I have, however,
found it in duplicate. The clerk of the Board of
Guardians, who should, I believe, have a copy of it, knew
nothing about it; and had never heard of such a document.
Your bishop's registrar was not much more learned,--but I
did find it in the bishop's chancery; and there is a copy
of it also at Saint John's, which seems to imply that
great attention has been paid by the college as patron to
the interests of the parish priest. This is more than has
been done by the incumbent, who seems to be an ignorant
fellow in such matters. I wonder how many parsons there
are in the Church who would let a Marquis and a Methodist
minister between them build a chapel on the parish glebe?

<p/>Yours ever,

<p/>RICHARD QUICKENHAM.

<p/>If I were to charge you through an attorney for my trouble
you'd have to mortgage your life interest in the bit of
land to pay me. I enclose a draft from the terrier as far
as the plot of ground and the vicarage-gate are concerned.


<p/>Here was information! This detestable combination of dissenting
and tyrannically territorial influences had been used to build a
Methodist Chapel upon land of which he (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>), during his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) incumbency in the
parish, was the freehold possessor! What an ass he (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) must have been
not to know his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) own possessions! How ridiculous would he (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) appear when
he (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) should come forward to claim as a part of the glebe a morsel of
land to which he (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) had paid no special attention whatever since he (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) had
been in the parish! And then, what would it be his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) duty to do? Mr.
Quickenham had clearly stated that on behalf of the college, which
was the patron of the living, and on behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) successors, it was
his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) duty to claim the land. And was it possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) should not
do so after such usage as he (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) had received from Lord Trowbridge? So
meditating,--but grieving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) should be driven at such a moment
to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) mind forcibly filled with such matters,--still hearing
the chapel bell, which in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) ears drowned the sound from his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) own
modest belfry, and altogether doubtful as to what step he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) would take,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) own church. It was manifest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) that of the poorer
part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) usual audience, and of the smaller farmers, one half were
in attendance upon Mr. Puddleham's triumph.

<p/>During the whole of that afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) said not a word of the
barrister's letter to any one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) struggled to banish the subject
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) thoughts. Failing to do that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) did banish it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
tongue. The letter was in the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) coat; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) showed it to
no one. Gilmore dined at the vicarage; but even to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was silent.
Of course the conversation at dinner turned upon the chapel. It was
impossible that on such a day they should speak of anything else.
Even as they sat at their early dinner Mr. Puddleham's bell was
ringing, and no doubt there was a vigour in the pulling of it which
would not be maintained when the pulling of it should have become a
thing of every week. There had been a compact made, in accordance
with which the Vicar's wife was to be debarred from saying anything
against the chapel, and, no doubt, when the compact was made, the
understanding was that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should give over hating the chapel. This
had, of course, been found to be impossible, but in a certain way she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
had complied with the compact. The noise of the bell however, was
considered to be beyond the compact, and on this occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
almost violent in the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wrath. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband listened
to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and sat without rebuking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), silent, with the lawyer's
letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) pocket. This bell had been put up on his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) own land, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) could pull it down to-morrow. It had been put up by the express
agency of Lord Trowbridge, and with the direct view of annoying him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>);
and Lord Trowbridge had behaved to him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) in a manner which set all
Christian charity at defiance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) told himself plainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) had no
desire to forgive Lord Trowbridge,--that life in this world, as it is
constituted, would not be compatible with such forgiveness,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
would not, indeed, desire to injure Lord Trowbridge otherwise than by
exacting such penalty as would force him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) and such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) to restrain
their tyranny; but that to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>), till he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) should have been so
forced, would be weak and injurious to the community. As to that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
had quite made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) mind, in spite of all doctrine to the contrary.
Men in this world would have to go naked if they gave their coats
to the robbers who took their cloaks; and going naked is manifestly
inexpedient. His (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) office of parish priest would be lowered in the
world if he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) forgave, out of hand, such offences as these which had
been committed against him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) by Lord Trowbridge. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) understood
clearly. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) might put down, not only the bell, but with the
bell the ill-conditioned peer who had caused it to be put up--on
glebe land. All this went through his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) mind again and again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
determined that on that day, being Sunday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) would think no more
about it.

<p/>When the Monday came it was necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) should show the letter
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) wife,--to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) wife, and to the Squire, and to Mary Lowther. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
had no idea of keeping the matter secret from his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) near friends and
advisers; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) had an idea that it would be well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) should
make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) mind as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) would do before he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) asked their advice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) started, therefore, for a turn through the parish before breakfast
on Monday morning,--and resolved as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) course of action. On no
consideration whatever would he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) have the chapel pulled down. It was
necessary for his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) purpose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) should have his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) triumph over the
Marquis,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) would have it. But the chapel had been built for a
good purpose which it would adequately serve, and let what might be
said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) wife or others, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) would not have a brick of it
disturbed. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) had no more power to give the land for its
present or any other purpose than had the Marquis. It might very
probably be his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) duty to take care that the land was not appropriated
to wrong purposes. It might be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had already neglected his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
duty, in not knowing, or in not having taken care to learn the
precise limits of the glebe which had been given over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) use during his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) incumbency. Nevertheless, there was the chapel,
and there it should stand, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was concerned. If the
churchwardens, or the archdeacon, or the college, or the bishop had
power to interfere, as to which he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was altogether ignorant, and chose
to exercise that power, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) could not help it. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was nearly sure that
his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own churchwardens would be guided altogether by himself,--and as
far as he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was concerned the chapel should remain unmolested. Having
thus resolved he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) came back to breakfast and read Mr. Quickenham's
letter aloud to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) wife and Mary Lowther.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glebe!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar's wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that it is part of your own land?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>asked Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that old thief of a Marquis has given away what belongs to us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) has given away what did not belong to himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.
<div class="bookquote">``But I can't admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)'s a thief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) ought to have known,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for that, so ought I to have known, I suppose. The whole thing
is one of the most ridiculous mistakes that ever was made. It has
absolutely come to pass that here, in the middle of Wiltshire, with
all our maps, and surveys, and parish records, no one concerned has
known to whom belonged a quarter of an acre of land in the centre
of the village. It is just a thing to write an article about in a
newspaper; but I can't say that one party is more to blame than the
other; that is, in regard to the ignorance displayed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what will you do, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will do nothing, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do nothing; but I will take care to let the Marquis know the
nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) generosity. I fancy that I am bound to take on myself
that labour, and I must say that it won't trouble me much to have to
write the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't pull it down, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would, before a week was over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So would I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it ought to be there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it ought not to be there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They might as well have it here in the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not in the garden; and, as it has been built, it shall
remain,--as far as I am concerned. I shall rather like it, now that
I know I am the landlord. I think I shall claim a sitting.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>This was
the Vicar's decision on the Monday morning, and from that decision
the two ladies were quite unable to move him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>).

<p/>This occurred a day or two after the affair of the rubies, and at
a time when Mary was being very hard pressed to name a day for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
wedding. Of course such pressure had been the result of Mr. Gilmore's
success on that occasion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had then resolutely gone to work to
overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), melancholy gloom, and, having in a great
degree succeeded, it was only natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) should bring up that
question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) marriage day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), had
done so with a stipulation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should not be hurried; but we all
know what such stipulations are worth. Who is to define what is and
what is not hurry? They had now been engaged a month, and the Squire
was clearly of opinion that there had been no hurry. <div class="bookquote">``September was
the nicest month in the year,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for getting married and
going abroad. September in Switzerland, October among the Italian
lakes, November in Florence and Rome. So that they might get home
before Christmas after a short visit to Naples.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was the
Squire's programme, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) whole manner was altered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) made it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) knew the nature of the girl well enough to be sure
that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would profess no passionate love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) before
starting on such a journey, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would change her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tone before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
returned. It should be no fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not change it. Mary
had at first declined to fix any day, had talked of next year, had
declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not be hurried. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had carried on the fight
even after the affair of the rubies, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had fought in opposition
to strong and well-disciplined forces on the other side, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
begun to admit to herself that it might be expedient that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should
yield. The thing was to be done, and why not have it done at once?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not as yet yielded, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would
yield.

<p/>At such a period it was of course natural that the Squire should
be daily at the vicarage, and on this Monday morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) came down
while the minds of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) friends there were intent on the strange
information received from Mr. Quickenham. The Vicar was not by when
Mr. Gilmore was told, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was thus easily induced to join in
the opinion that the chapel should be made to disappear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had a
landlord's idea about land, and was thoroughly well-disposed to stop
any encroachment on the part of the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord Trowbridge must pull it down himself, and put it up again
elsewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Frank says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) won't let the Marquis pull it down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Fenwick, almost moved to tears by the tragedy of the occasion.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Mr. Quickenham's letter discussed.-RSB-


<p/>Then the Vicar joined them, and the matter was earnestly debated;--so
earnestly that, on that occasion, not a word was said as to the day
of the wedding.




<p/>CHAPTER LVI.

<p/>THE VICAR``S VENGEANCE.


<p/>No eloquence on the part of the two ladies at the vicarage, or of the
Squire, could turn Mr. Fenwick from his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) purpose, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did consent
at last to go over with the Squire to Salisbury, and to consult Mr.
Chamberlaine. A proposition was made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) as to consulting the
bishop, for whom personally he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) always expressed a liking, and whose
office he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) held in the highest veneration; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
explained that this was not a matter in which the bishop should be
invited to exercise authority.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The bishop has nothing to do with my freehold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you want an opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Gilmore</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, <div class="bookquote">``why not go to a man
whose opinion will be worth having?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Gilmore</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the Vicar explained again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) respect for the bishop was so
great, that any opinion coming from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) lordship would, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>),
be more than advice; it would be law. So great was his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) mingled
admiration of the man and respect for the office!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, <div class="bookquote">``is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't go to the
bishop, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind already. You are, both of
you, throwing away your time and money in going to Salisbury at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure but what she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s right there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.
Nevertheless they went to Salisbury.

<p/>The Rev. Henry Fitzackerly Chamberlaine was very eloquent, clear, and
argumentative on the subject, and perhaps a little overbearing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>)
insisted that the chapel should be removed without a moment's delay;
and that notice as to its removal should be served upon all the
persons concerned,--upon Mr. Puddleham, upon the builder, upon
the chapel trustees, the elders of the congregation,--<div class="bookquote">``if there
be any elders,''  (<font color='red'><b>the congregation</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chamberlaine, with a delightful touch
of irony,--and upon the Marquis and the Marquis's agent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was
eloquent, authoritative and loud. When the Vicar remarked that after
all the chapel had been built for a good purpose, Mr. Chamberlaine
became quite excited in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) eloquence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The glebe of Bullhampton, Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``has not been
confided to your care for the propagation of dissent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor has the vicarage house been confided to me for the reading of
novels; but that is what goes on there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The house is for your private comfort,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the prebendary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so is the glebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar; <div class="bookquote">``and I shall not be
comfortable if I make these people put down a house of prayer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>And there was another argument against the Vicar's views, very
strong. This glebe was only given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) in trust. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was bound
so to use it, that it should fall into the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) successor
unimpaired and with full capability for fruition. <div class="bookquote">``You have no right
to leave to another the demolition of a building, the erection of
which you should have prevented.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>This argument was more difficult of
answer than the other, but Mr. Fenwick did answer it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and I think it likely that my estate may
be liable for the expense of removal. The chapel may be brought in
as a dilapidation. But that which I can answer with my purse, need
not lie upon my conscience. I could let the bit of land, I have no
doubt,--though not on a building lease.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they have built on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chamberlaine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt, they have; and I can see that my estate may be called upon
to restore the bit of ground to its former position. What I can't see
is, that I am bound to enforce the removal now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Chamberlaine took up the matter with great spirit, and gave a
couple of hours to the discussion, but the Vicar was not shaken.

<p/>The Vicar was not shaken, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) went out from the
prebendary's presence, left some doubt as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) firmness in the mind
both of that dignitary and of the Squire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thanked Mr. Chamberlaine
very courteously, and acknowledged that there was a great deal in the
arguments which had been used.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you will find it best to clear your ground of the nuisance
at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chamberlaine/Mr. CHAMBERLAINE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chamberlaine, with that high tone which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlaine</b></font>) knew so
well how to assume; and these were the last words spoken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, as soon as they were out in the Close,
asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) friend as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a very knotty point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't much like my uncle's tone,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire; <div class="bookquote">``I never do.
But I think he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't say but what he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll have to come down, Frank,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt, some day. But I am quite sure as to this, Harry; that when
you have a doubt as to your duty, you can't be wrong in delaying
that, the doing of which would gratify your own ill will. Don't you
go and tell this to the women; but to my eyes that conventicle at
Bullhampton is the most hideous, abominable, and disagreeable object
that ever was placed upon the earth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is to mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore I won't touch a brick of it. It shall be my hair
shirt, my fast day, my sacrifice of a broken heart, my little pet
good work. It will enable me to take all the good things of the world
that come in my way, and flatter myself that I am not self-indulgent.
There is not a dissenter in Bullhampton will get so much out of the
chapel as I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy they can make you have it pulled down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then their making me shall be my hair shirt, and I shall be fitted
just as well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Gilmore</b></font>)</div>Upon that they went back to Bullhampton, and the
Squire told the two ladies what had passed; as to the hair shirt and
all.

<p/>Mr. Fenwick in making for himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) hair shirt did not think it
necessary to abstain from writing to the Marquis of Trowbridge.
This he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) did on that same day after his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) return from Salisbury. In
the middle of the winter he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) had written a letter to the Marquis,
remonstrating against the building of the chapel opposite to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own
gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) now took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) copy of that letter, and the answer to
it, in which the agent of the Marquis had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) that the Marquis
considered that the spot in question was the most eligible site which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) lordship could bestow for the purpose in question. Our Vicar was
very anxious not to disturb the chapel now that it was built; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
was quite as anxious to disturb the Marquis. In the formation of that
hair shirt which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was minded to wear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did not intend to weave
in any mercy towards the Marquis. It behoved him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) to punish the
Marquis,--for the good of society in general. As a trespasser he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
forgave the Marquis, in a Christian point of view; but as a pestilent
wasp on the earth, stinging folks right and left with an arrogance,
the ignorance of which was the only excuse to be made for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
cruelty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) thought it to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) duty to set his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) heel upon the
Marquis; which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did by writing the following letter.


<p/>Bullhampton Vicarage, July 18, 186--.

<p/>MY LORD MARQUIS,

<p/>On the 3rd of January last I ventured to write to your
lordship with the object of saving myself and my family
from a great annoyance, and of saving you also from the
disgrace of subjecting me to it. I then submitted to you
the expediency of giving in the parish some other site for
the erection of a dissenting chapel than the small patch
of ground immediately opposite to the vicarage gate,
which, as I explained to you, I had always regarded as
belonging to the vicarage. I did not for a moment question
your lordship's right to give the land in question, but
appealed simply to your good-feeling. I confess that I
took it for granted that even your lordship, in so very
high-handed a proceeding, would take care to have right
on your side. In answer to this I received a letter from
your man of business, of which, as coming from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I do
not complain, but which, as a reply to my letter to your
lordship, was an insult. The chapel has been built, and on
last Sunday was opened for worship.

<p/>I have now learned that the land which you have given
away did not belong to your lordship, and never formed a
portion of the Stowte estate in this parish. It was, and
is, glebe land; and formed, at the time of your bestowal,
a portion of my freehold as Vicar. I acknowledge that I
was remiss in presuming that you as a landlord knew the
limits of your own rights, and that you would not trespass
beyond them. I should have made my inquiry more urgently.
I have made it now, and your lordship may satisfy yourself
by referring to the maps of the parish lands, which are to
be found in the bishop's chancery, and also at St. John's,
Oxford, if you cannot do so by any survey of the estate in
your own possession. I enclose a sketch showing the exact
limits of the glebe in respect to the vicarage entrance
and the patch of ground in question. The fact is, that the
chapel in question has been built on the glebe land by
authority--illegally and unjustly given by your lordship.

<p/>The chapel is there, and though it is a pity that it
should have been built, it would be a greater pity that it
should be pulled down. It is my purpose to offer to the
persons concerned a lease of the ground for the term of my
incumbency at a nominal rent. I presume that a lease may
be so framed as to protect the rights of my successor.

<p/>I will not conclude this letter without expressing my
opinion that gross as has been your lordship's ignorance
in giving away land which did not belong to you, your
fault in that respect has been very trifling in comparison
with the malice you have shown to a clergyman of your own
church, settled in a parish partly belonging to yourself,
in having caused the erection of this chapel on the
special spot selected with no other object than that of
destroying my personal comfort and that of my wife.

<p/>I have the honour to be
Your lordship's most obedient servant,

<p/>FRANCIS FENWICK.


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) epistle he (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) read it over more than once, and
was satisfied that it would be vexatious to the Marquis. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
direct object to vex the Marquis, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had set about it with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) vigour. <div class="bookquote">``I would skin him (<font color='blue'><b>dissenter</b></font>) if I knew how,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had said to Gilmore.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dissenter</b></font>) has done that to me which no man should forgive. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has spoken
ill of me, and calumniated me, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has thought ill of me,
but because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had a spite against me. They may keep their chapel
as far as I am concerned. But as for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lordship, I should think ill
of myself if I spared him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) lordship on the hip, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
did not spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) showed the letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't malice a very strong word?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>answered the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I mean is, might you not soften it without hurting your cause?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not. I conscientiously believe the accusation to be true.
I endeavour so to live among my neighbours that I may not disgrace
them, or you, or myself. This man has dared to accuse me openly of
the grossest immorality and hypocrisy, when I am only doing my duty
as I best know how to do it; and I do now believe in my heart that in
making these charges he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not himself credit them. At any rate, no
man can be justified in making such charges without evidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But all that had nothing to do with the bit of ground, Frank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is part and parcel of the same thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has chosen to treat me
as an enemy, and has used all the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) wealth and rank to
injure me. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) must look to himself. I will not say a word of him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>),
or to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), that is untrue; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has said evil of me behind my
back which he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) did not believe, so will I say the evil of him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), which I
do believe, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) face.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>The letter was sent, and before the day was
over the Vicar had recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) good humour.

<p/>And before the day was over the news was all through the parish.
There was a certain ancient shoemaker in the village who had carried
on business in Devizes, and had now retired to spend the evening of
his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) life in his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) native place. Mr. Bolt was a quiet, inoffensive old
man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bolt</b></font>) was a dissenter, and was one of the elders and trustees
who had been concerned in raising money for the chapel. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Bolt</b></font>) the
Vicar had told the whole story, declaring at the same time that, as
far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was concerned, Mr. Puddleham and his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) congregation should,
at any rate for the present, be made welcome to their chapel. This
he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) had done immediately on his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) return from Salisbury, and before the
letter to the Marquis was written. Mr. Bolt, not unnaturally, saw
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bolt</b></font>) minister the same evening, and the thing was discussed in full
conclave by the Puddlehamites. At the end of that discussion, Mr.
Puddleham expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) conviction that the story was a mare's nest
from beginning to end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) didn't believe a word of it. The Marquis
was not the man to give away anything that did not belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>).
Somebody had hoaxed the Vicar, or the Vicar had hoaxed Mr. Bolt; or
else,--which Mr. Puddleham thought to be most likely,--the Vicar
had gone mad with vexation at the glory and the triumph of the new
chapel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was uncommon civil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bolt, who at this moment was
somewhat inclined to favour the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt, Mr. Bolt; no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Puddleham, who had quite
recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) first dismay, and had worked himself up to a state
of eloquent enthusiasm. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Bolt</b></font>) was civil. Why not? In old
days when we hardly dared to talk of having a decent house of prayer
of our own in which to worship our God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was always civil. No one
has ever heard me accuse Mr. Fenwick of incivility. But will any one
tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) is a friend to our mode of worship? Gentlemen, we
must look to ourselves, and I for one tell you that that chapel is
ours. You won't find that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) ban will keep me out of my pulpit.
Glebe, indeed! why should the Vicar have glebe on the other side of
the road from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) house? Or, for the matter of that, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
have glebe at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div>This was so decisive that no one at the meeting
had a word to say after Mr. Puddleham had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) speech.

<p/>When the Marquis received his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was up in London. Lord
Trowbridge was not much given to London life, but was usually
compelled by circumstances,--the circumstances being the custom of
society as pleaded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) two daughters,--to spend the months of May,
June, and July at the family mansion in Grosvenor Square. Moreover,
though the Marquis never opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) mouth in the House of Lords, it
was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) thought, imperative on him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) to give to the leader of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
party the occasional support of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) personal presence. Our Vicar,
knowing this, had addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) letter to Grosvenor Square, and
it had thus reached its destination without loss of time. Lord
Trowbridge by this time knew the handwriting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) enemy; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
broke the envelope, there came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) an idea that it might be wise
to refuse the letter, and to let it go back to its writer unopened.
It was beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) dignity to correspond with a man, or to receive
letters from a man who would probably insult him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
make up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, the envelope had been opened, and the letter had
been read. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrath, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had read it, no writer of a simple
prose narration should attempt to describe. <div class="bookquote">``Disgrace,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``insult,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``ignorance,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``malice,'' (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>--these were the words with which the
Marquis found himself pelted by this pestilent, abominable, and most
improper clergyman. As to the gist of the letter itself, it was some
time before he (<font color='blue'><b>gist</b></font>) understood it. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>gist</b></font>) did begin to understand
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>gist</b></font>) did not as yet begin to believe it. His (<font color='blue'><b>gist</b></font>) intelligence worked
slowly, whereas his (<font color='blue'><b>gist</b></font>) wrath worked quickly. But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>gist</b></font>) began to ask
himself whether the accusation made against him (<font color='blue'><b>gist</b></font>) could possibly be
based on truth. When the question of giving the land had been under
consideration, it had never occurred to any one concerned that it
could belong to the glebe. There had been some momentary suspicion
that the spot might possibly have been so long used as common land as
to give room for a question on that side; but no one had dreamed that
any other claimant could arise. That the whole village of Bullhampton
belonged to the Marquis was notorious. Of course there was the glebe.
But who could think that the morsel of neglected land lying on the
other side of the road belonged to the vicarage? The Marquis did not
believe it now. This was some piece of wickedness concocted by the
venomous brain of the iniquitous Vicar, more abominable than all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
other wickednesses. The Marquis did not believe it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) walked up
and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) room all the morning thinking of it. The Marquis was
sure that it was not true, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could not for a moment get the
idea out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) mind. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) must tell St. George. The language
of the letter which had been sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was so wicked, that St.
George must at least agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) now in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) anger against this
man. And could nothing be done to punish the man? Prosecutions in
regard to anonymous letters, threatening letters, begging letters,
passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that punishment had been inflicted
on the writers of insolent letters to royalty. And letters had been
proved to be criminal as being libellous,--only then they must be
published; and letters were sometimes held to form a conspiracy;--but
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not quite see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way to that. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not
royal; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that the Vicar neither threatened him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) or begged
aught from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). What if St. George should tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) again that this
Vicar had right on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) side! He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) cast the matter about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) mind all
the day; and then, late in the afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) carriage,
and had himself driven to the chambers of Messrs. Boothby, the family
lawyers.




<p/>CHAPTER LVII.

<p/>OIL IS TO BE THROWN UPON THE WATERS.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration-RSB-

<p/>Messrs. Boothby in Lincoln's Inn had for very many years been the
lawyers of the Stowte family, and probably knew as much about
the property as any of the Stowtes themselves. They had not been
consulted about the giving away of the bit of land for the chapel
purposes, nor had they been instructed to draw up any deed of gift.
The whole thing had been done irregularly. The land had been only
promised, and not in truth as yet given, and the Puddlehamites, in
their hurry, had gone to work and had built upon a promise. The
Marquis, when, after the receipt of Mr. Fenwick's letter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) first
rage was over, went at once to the chambers of Messrs. Boothby, and
was forced to explain all the circumstances of the case to the senior
partner before he (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) could show the clergyman's wicked epistle. Old Mr.
Boothby was a man of the same age as the Marquis, and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) way,
quite as great. Only the lawyer was a clever old man, whereas the
Marquis was a stupid old man. Mr. Boothby sat, bowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) head, as
the Marquis told his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) story. The story was rather confused, and for
awhile Mr. Boothby could only understand that a dissenting chapel had
been built upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) client's land.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have to set it right by some scrap of a conveyance,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said
the lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the Vicar of the parish claims it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Claims the chapel, my lord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) is a most pestilent, abominable man, Mr. Boothby. I have brought
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) letter here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boothby/Boothby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Boothby held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) hand to receive the
letter. From almost any client he (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) would prefer a document to an oral
explanation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) would do so especially from his (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) lordship. <div class="bookquote">``But
you must understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>continued the Marquis, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) is quite unlike
any ordinary clergyman. I have the greatest respect for the church,
and am always happy to see clergymen at my own house. But this is a
litigious, quarrelsome fellow. They tell me he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s an infidel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
keeps--! Altogether, Mr. Boothby, nothing can be worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer, still holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hand for the letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) has taken the trouble to insult me continually. You heard how a
tenant of mine was murdered? He (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) was murdered by a young man whom this
clergyman screens, because,--because,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) is the brother of,--of,--of
the young woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be very bad, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knows all about the murder;--I am convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
does. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) went bail for the young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to associate with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
on most intimate terms. As to the sister;--there's no doubt about
that. They live on the land of a person who owns a small estate in
the parish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gilmore, my lord?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so. This Mr. Fenwick has got Mr. Gilmore in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) pocket.
You can have no idea of such a state of things as this. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
writes me this letter! I know his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) handwriting now, and any further
communication I shall return.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Marquis</b></font>)</div>The Marquis ceased to speak, and the
lawyer at once buried himself in the letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is meant to be offensive,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most insolent, most offensive, most improper! And yet the bishop
upholds him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is right about the bit of land, my lord, it will be rather
awkward.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) spoke, the lawyer examined the sketch of the
vicarage entrance. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) gives this as copied from the terrier of the
parish, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe a word of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't look at the plan of the estate, my lord?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think we did; but Packer had no doubt. No one knows the
property in Bullhampton so well as Packer, and Packer said--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div><p/>But while the Marquis was still speaking the lawyer rose, and begging
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) client's pardon, went to the clerk in the outer room. Nor did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) return till the clerk had descended to an iron chamber in the
basement, and returned from thence with a certain large tin box.
Into this a search was made, and presently Mr. Boothby came back
with a weighty lump of dusty vellum documents, and a manuscript map,
or sketch of a survey of the Bullhampton estate, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) had had
opened. While the search was being made he (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) had retired to another
room, and had had a little conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) partner about
the weather. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid the parson is right, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boothby/Boothby</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Boothby, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) closed the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) facts, my lord. It is glebe, and is marked so here very
plainly. There should have been a reference to us,--there should,
indeed, my lord. Packer, and men like him (<font color='blue'><b>Packer</b></font>), really know nothing. The
truth is, in such matters nobody knows anything. You should always
have documentary evidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it is glebe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a doubt of it, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the Marquis knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) enemy had him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) on the hip, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) laid
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) old head down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) folded arms and wept. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) weeping it
is probable that no tears rolled down his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) cheeks, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) wept inward
tears,--tears of hatred, remorse, and self-commiseration. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) enemy
had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) with scourges, and, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could see at present,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could not return a blow. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) must submit himself,--must restore
the bit of land, and build those nasty dissenters a chapel elsewhere
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own property. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had not a doubt as to that for a moment.
Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) have escaped the shame of it,--as far as the expense was
concerned he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would have been willing to build them ten chapels. And
in doing this he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would give a triumph, an unalloyed triumph, to a
man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) believed to be thoroughly bad. The Vicar had accused the
Marquis of spreading reports which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), the Marquis, did not himself
believe; but the Marquis believed them all. At this moment there was
no evil that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could not have believed of Mr. Fenwick. While sitting
there an idea, almost amounting to a conviction, had come upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), that Mr. Fenwick had himself been privy to the murder of old
Trumbull. What would not a parson do who would take delight in
insulting and humiliating the nobleman who owned the parish in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) lived? To Lord Trowbridge the very fact that the parson of the
parish which he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) regarded as his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) own was opposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>), proved
sufficiently that that parson was,--scum, dregs, riff-raff, a low
radical, and everything that a parson ought not to be. The Vicar had
been wrong there. The Marquis did believe it all religiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What must I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to the chapel itself, my lord, the Vicar, bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) is, does not
want to move it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must come down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, getting up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) chair.
<div class="bookquote">``It shall come down. Do you think that I would allow it to stand
when it has been erected on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) ground,--through my error? Not for a
day!--not for an hour! I'll tell you what, Mr. Boothby,--that man has
known it all through;--has known it as well as you do now; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) has
waited till the building was complete before he (<font color='blue'><b>Boothby</b></font>) would tell me. I see
it all as plain as the nose on your face, Mr. Boothby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>The lawyer was meditating how best he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) might explain to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
angry client that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had no power whatsoever to pull down the
building,--that if the Vicar and the dissenting minister chose
to agree about it the new building must stand, in spite of the
Marquis,--must stand, unless the churchwardens, patron, or
ecclesiastical authorities generally should force the Vicar to
have it removed,--when a clerk came in and whispered a word to the
attorney. <div class="bookquote">``My lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boothby/Boothby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Boothby, <div class="bookquote">``Lord St. George is here.
Shall he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) come in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boothby/Boothby</b></font>)</div><p/>The Marquis did not wish to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son exactly at this minute;
but Lord St. George was, of course, admitted. This meeting at the
lawyer's chambers was altogether fortuitous, and father and son were
equally surprised. But so great was the anger and dismay and general
perturbation of the Marquis at the time, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could not stop to
ask any question. St. George must, of course, know what had happened,
and it was quite as well that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should be told at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That bit of ground they've built the chapel on at Bullhampton, turns
out to be--glebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis. Lord St. George whistled. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course, Mr. Fenwick knew it all along,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hardly think that,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You read his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) letter. Mr. Boothby, will you be so good as to show
Lord St. George the letter? You never read such a production.
Impudent scoundrel! Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) knew it all the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord St. George read the letter. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) is very impudent, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) be
a scoundrel or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impudent is no word for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) has had some provocation, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not from me, St. George;--not from me. I have done nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
Of course the chapel must be--removed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think the question might stand over for a while?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Boothby/Boothby</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Boothby. <div class="bookquote">``Matters would become smoother in a month or
two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/>Lord St. George walked about the room with the letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand,
meditating. <div class="bookquote">``The truth is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, at last, <div class="bookquote">``we have made a
mistake, and we must get out of it as best we can. I think my father
is a little wrong about this clergyman's character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``St. George! Have you read his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) letter? Is that a proper letter to
come from a clergyman of the Church of England to--to--to--''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>the
Marquis longed to say to the Marquis of Trowbridge; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did not
dare so to express himself before his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son,--<div class="bookquote">``to the landlord of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
parish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A red-brick chapel, just close to your lodge, isn't nice, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has got no lodge,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so we thought we'd build him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) one. Let me manage this. I'll see
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and I'll see the minister, and I'll endeavour to throw some oil
upon the waters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to throw oil upon the waters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord St. George is in the right, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>said the attorney; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
really is. It is a case in which we must throw a little oil upon the
waters. We've made a mistake, and when we've done that we should
always throw oil upon the waters. I've no doubt Lord St. George
will find a way out of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>Then the father and the son went away
together, and before they had reached the Houses of Parliament Lord
St. George had persuaded his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father to place the matter of the
Bullhampton chapel in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``And as for the letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div>said St.
George, <div class="bookquote">``do not you notice it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the slightest intention of noticing it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the
Marquis, haughtily.




<p/>CHAPTER LVIII.

<p/>EDITH BROWNLOW``S DREAM.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, sit down; I want to speak to you. Do you know I should like
to see you--married.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edith/Edith Brownlow/EDITH BROWNLOW</b></font>)</div>This speech was made at Dunripple to Edith
Brownlow by her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) uncle, Sir Gregory, one morning in July, as she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was
attending him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) breakfast. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) breakfast consisted always of
a cup of chocolate, made after a peculiar fashion, and Edith was in
the habit of standing by the old man's bedside while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>)
would never sit down, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) knew that were she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) to do so she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>)
would be pretty nearly hidden out of sight in the old arm-chair that
stood at the bed-head; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) was specially invited to do so,
and that in a manner which almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) think that it would be
well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) should hide herself for a space. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) did not sit
down. There was the empty cup to be taken from Sir Gregory's hands,
and, after the first moment of surprise, Edith was not quite sure
that it would be good that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) should hide herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) took the cup
and put it on the table, and then returned, without making any reply.
<div class="bookquote">``I should like very much to see you married, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregory/Gregory Marrable/GREGORY MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Sir
Gregory, in the mildest of voices.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to get rid of me, uncle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear; that is just what I don't want. Of course you'll marry
somebody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see any of course, Uncle Gregory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why shouldn't you? I suppose you have thought about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only in a general way, Uncle Gregory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gregory/Gregory Marrable/GREGORY MARRABLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Gregory Marrable was not a wise man. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) folly was of an order
very different from that of Lord Trowbridge,--very much less likely
to do harm to himself or others, much more innocent, and, folly
though it was, a great deal more compatible with certain intellectual
gifts. Lord Trowbridge, not to put too fine a point upon it, was
a fool all round. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) was much too great a fool to have an idea of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) own folly. Now Sir Gregory distrusted himself in everything,
conceived himself to be a poor creature, would submit himself to a
child on any question of literature, and had no opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) own
on any matter outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) own property,--and even as to that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>)
opinion was no more than lukewarm. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) read a great deal, had much
information stored away somewhere in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) memory, and had learned at
any rate to know how small a fly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was himself on the wheel of the
world. But, alas, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) did meddle with anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was apt to
make a mess of it. There had been some conversation between him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) sister-in-law, Edith's mother, about Walter Marrable; some
also between him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) son, and between him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) and Miss Marrable,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) cousin. But as yet no one had spoken to Edith, and as Captain
Marrable himself had not spoken, it would have been as well, perhaps,
if Sir Gregory had held his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) tongue. After Edith's last answer the old
man was silent for awhile, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) returned to the subject with a
downright question,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you like Walter when he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Marrable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--Captain Marrable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) well enough,--in a way, Uncle Gregory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing would please me so much, Edith, as that you should become
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) wife. You know that Dunripple will belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Gregory does not marry.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edith/Edith Brownlow/EDITH BROWNLOW</b></font>)</div>Edith had hardly known whether to say
this or to leave it unsaid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) was well aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) cousin
Gregory would never marry,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was a confirmed invalid, a man
already worn out, old before his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) time, and with one foot in the
grave. But had she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) not said it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) would have seemed to herself to
have put him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) aside as a person altogether out of the way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gregory will never marry. Of course while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) lives Dunripple will be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>); but if Walter were to marry he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would make arrangements. I dare
say you can't understand all about that, my dear; but it would be a
very good thing. I should be so happy if I thought that you were to
live at Dunripple always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edith/Edith Brownlow/EDITH BROWNLOW</b></font>)</div><p/>Edith kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) and escaped without giving any other answer. Ten
days after that Walter Marrable was to be again at Dunripple,--only
for a few days; but still in a few days the thing might be settled.
Edith had heard something of Mary Lowther, but not much. There had
been some idea of a match between Walter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) cousin Mary, but the
idea had been blown away. So much Edith had heard. To herself Walter
Marrable had been very friendly, and, in truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) had liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
much. They two were not cousins, but they were so connected, and had
for some weeks been so thrown together, as to be almost as good as
cousins. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) presence at Dunripple had been very pleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>), but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) had never thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) as a lover. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) had an idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>)
own, that girls ought not to think of men as lovers without a good
deal of provocation.

<p/>Sir Gregory spoke to Mrs. Brownlow on the same subject, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>)
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) what had taken place between him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) and Edith, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) felt herself
compelled to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it should take place, my dear, it would be very well; but I would
rather your uncle had not mentioned it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't do any harm, mamma. I mean, that I shan't break my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to be a very excellent young man,--not at all like his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
father, who has been as bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) can be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) in love with Mary Lowther last winter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, my dear. I never believe stories of this kind. When I
hear that a young man is going to be married to a young lady, then I
believe that they are in love with each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is to be hoped so then, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I never believe any thing before. And I think you may take it
for granted that there is nothing in that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be nothing to me, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It might be something. But I will say nothing more about it. You've
so much good sense that I am quite sure you won't get into trouble. I
wish Sir Gregory had not spoken to you; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) has, it may be as
well that you should know that the family arrangement would be very
agreeable to your uncle and to cousin Gregory. The title and the
property must go to Captain Marrable at last, and Sir Gregory would
make immediate sacrifices for you, which perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) would not make
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edith/Edith Brownlow/EDITH BROWNLOW</b></font>)</div><p/>Edith understood all about it very clearly, and would have understood
all about it with half the words. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) would have little or no fortune
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) own, and in money her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) uncle would have very little to give to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>). Indeed, there was no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) should give her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>)
was not connected with any of the Marrables by blood, though chance
had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) to live at Dunripple almost all her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) had
become half a Marrable already, and it might be very well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>)
should become a Marrable altogether. Walter was a remarkably handsome
man, would be a baronet, and would have an estate, and might,
perhaps, have the enjoyment of the estate by marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) earlier
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would were he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) to marry any one else. Edith Brownlow
understood it all with sufficient clearness. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) understood
also that young women shouldn't give away their hearts before they
are asked for them; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was quite sure that Walter Marrable had
made no sign of asking for hers. Nevertheless, within her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) own bosom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) did become a little anxious about Mary Lowther, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) wished
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) knew that story.

<p/>On the fourth of August Walter Marrable reached Dunripple, and found
the house given up almost entirely to the doctor. Both his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) uncle and
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cousin were very ill. When he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was able to obtain from the doctor
information on which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could rely, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) learned that Mr. Marrable was
in real danger, but that Sir Gregory's ailment was no more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
usual infirmity heightened by anxiety on behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``Your
uncle may live for the next ten years,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor; <div class="bookquote">``but I do
not know what to say about Mr. Marrable.''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>All this time the care
and time of the two ladies were divided between the invalids.
Mrs. Brownlow tended her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) nephew, and Edith, as usual, waited
upon Sir Gregory. In such circumstances it was not extraordinary
that Edith Brownlow and Walter Marrable should be thrown much
together,--especially as it was the desire of all concerned with them
that they should become man and wife. Poor Edith was subject to a
feeling that everybody knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) was expected to fall in love
with the man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) thought it probable, too, that the man himself had
been instructed to fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>). This no doubt created a
great difficulty for her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>), a difficulty which she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) felt to be heavy and
inconvenient;--but it was lessened by the present condition of the
household. When there is illness in a house, the feminine genius and
spirit predominates the male. If the illness be so severe as to cause
a sense of danger, this is so strongly the case that the natural
position of the two is changed. Edith, quite unconscious of the
reason, was much less afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) proposed lover than she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) would
have been had there been no going about on tiptoe, no questions asked
with bated breath, no great need for womanly aid.

<p/>Walter had been there four days, and was sitting with Edith one
evening out on the lawn among the rhododendrons. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had found
what was the condition of the household, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had offered to go back at
once to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) regiment at Birmingham. But Sir Gregory would not hear of
it. Sir Gregory hated the regiment, and had got an idea in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) head
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) nephew ought not to be there at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was too weak and
diffident to do it himself; but if any one would have arranged it for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) would have been glad to fix an income for Walter Marrable
on condition that Walter should live at home, and look after the
property, and be unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) as a son. But nothing had been fixed,
nothing had been said, and on the day but one following, the captain
was to return to Birmingham. Mrs. Brownlow was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) nephew, and
Walter was sitting with Edith among the rhododendrons, the two having
come out of the house together after such a dinner as is served in a
house of invalids. They had become very intimate, but Edith Brownlow
had almost determined that Walter Marrable did not intend to fall in
love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had quite determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) would not fall in
love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) did. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) might do in that case she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had not
told herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was not quite sure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was very nice,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was
not quite sure. One ought to be very fond of a young man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) said
to herself, before one falls in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Nevertheless her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) mind
was by no means set against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If one can oblige one's friends one
ought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) said, again to herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out a cup of coffee, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sitting in a
garden chair with a cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth. They were Walter and Edith
to each other, just as though they were cousins. Indeed, it was
necessary that they should be cousins to each other, for the rest of
their lives, if no more.

she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) mother as yet.




<p/>CHAPTER LIX.

<p/>NEWS FROM DUNRIPPLE.


<p/>At the end of the first week in August news reached the vicarage at
Bullhampton that was not indeed very important to the family of Mr.
Fenwick, but which still seemed to have an immediate effect on their
lives and comfort. The Vicar for some days past had been, as regarded
himself, in a high good humour, in consequence of a communication
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had received from Lord St. George. Further mention of this
communication must be made, but it may be deferred to the next
chapter, as other matters, more momentous, require our immediate
attention. Mr. Gilmore had pleaded very hard that a day might be
fixed, and had almost succeeded. Mary Lowther, driven into a corner,
had been able to give no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) should not fix a day, other
than this,--that Mr. Gilmore had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) should not be
hurried. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Fenwick had said, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``You
speak of the man who is to be your husband as though your greatest
happiness in life were to keep away from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>Mary Lowther had not
dared to answer that such would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) greatest happiness. Then news
had reached the vicarage of the illness of Gregory Marrable, and of
Walter Marrable's presence at Dunripple. This had come of course from
Aunt Sarah, at Loring; but it had come in such a manner as to seem to
justify, for a time, Mary's silence in reference to that question of
naming the day. The Marrables of Dunripple were not nearly related
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had no personal remembrance of either Sir Gregory or his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>)
son. But there was an importance attached to the tidings, which, if
analysed, would have been found to attach itself to Captain Marrable,
rather than to the two men who were ill; and this was tacitly allowed
to have an influence. Aunt Sarah had expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) belief that
Gregory Marrable was dying; and had gone on to say,--trusting to the
known fact that Mary had engaged herself to Mr. Gilmore, and to the
fact, as believed to be a fact, that Walter was engaged to Edith
Brownlow,--had gone on to say that Captain Marrable would probably
remain at Dunripple, and would take immediate charge of the estate.
<div class="bookquote">``I think there is no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Aunt Sarah</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Sarah, <div class="bookquote">``that Captain Marrable
and Edith Brownlow will be married.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Aunt Sarah</b></font>)</div>Mary was engaged to Mr. Gilmore,
and why should not Aunt Sarah tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) news?

<p/>The Squire, who had become elated and happy at the period of the
rubies, had, in three days, again fallen away into a state of angry
gloom, rather than of melancholy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said very little just now either
to Fenwick or to Mrs. Fenwick about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) marriage; and, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did
not say very much to Mary herself. Men were already at work about
the gardens at the Privets, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would report to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) what was done,
and would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that the masons and painters would begin in a few
days. Now and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) company up to the place; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been there twice at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) instance since the day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had gone after him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own accord, and had fetched him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) down to
look at the jewels. But there was little or no sympathy between them.
Mary could not bring herself to care about the house or the gardens,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) told herself again and again that there was she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to live
for the remainder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life.

<p/>Two letters she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt at Loring within an interval
of three days, and these letters were both filled with details as to
the illness of Sir Gregory and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) son, at Dunripple. Walter Marrable
sent accounts to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) uncle, the parson, and Mrs. Brownlow sent
accounts to Miss Marrable herself. And then, on the day following the
receipt of the last of these two letters, there came one from Walter
Marrable himself, addressed to Mary Lowther. Gregory Marrable was
dead, and the letter announcing the death of the baronet's only son
was as follows:--


<p/>Dunripple, August 12, 1868.

<p/>MY DEAR MARY,

<p/>I hardly know whether you will have expected that the news
which I have to tell you should reach you direct from me;
but I think, upon the whole, that it is better that I
should write. My cousin, Gregory Marrable, Sir Gregory's
only son, died this morning. I do not doubt but that you
know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) has been long ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) has come to the end of
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) troubles, and the old baronet is now childless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
also has been, and is still, unwell, though I do not know
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is much worse than usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) has been an invalid
for years and years. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) feels his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) son's death
acutely; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is a father who has ever been good to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
son. But it always seems to me that old people become so
used to death, that they do not think of it as do we who
are younger. I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) twice to-day since the news
was told to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) son with
infinite sorrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was able to talk of other things.

<p/>I write to you myself, especially, instead of getting one
of the ladies here to do so, because I think it proper
to tell you how things stand with myself. Everything is
changed with me since you and I parted because it was
necessary that I should seek my fortune in India. You
already know that I have abandoned that idea; and I now
find that I shall leave the army altogether. My uncle has
wished it since I first came here, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) now proposes
that I shall live here permanently. Of course the meaning
is that I should assume the position of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) heir. My
father, with whom I personally will have no dealing in
the matter, stands between us. But I do suppose that the
family affairs will be so arranged that I may feel secure
that I shall not be turned altogether adrift upon the
world.

<p/>Dear Mary,--I do not know how to tell you, that as regards
my future everything now depends on you. They have told me
that you have accepted an offer from Mr. Gilmore. I know
no more than this,--that they have told me so. If you will
tell me also that you mean to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wife, I will say no
more. But until you tell me so, I will not believe it. I
do not think that you can ever love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) as you certainly
once loved me;--and when I think of it, how short a time
ago that was! I know that I have no right to complain.
Our separation was my doing as much as yours. But I will
settle nothing as to my future life till I hear from
yourself whether or no you will come back to me.

<p/>I shall remain here till after the funeral, which will
take place on Friday. On Monday I shall go back to
Birmingham. This is Sunday, and I shall expect to hear
from you before the week is over. If you bid me, I will be
with you early next week. If you tell me that my coming
will be useless,--why, then, I shall care very little what
happens.

<p/>Yours, with all the love of my heart,

<p/>WALTER MARRABLE.


<p/>Luckily for Mary she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was alone when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) read the letter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first
idea on reading it was to think of the words which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had used
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had most ungraciously consented to become the wife of
Harry Gilmore. <div class="bookquote">``Were he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) so placed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could afford to marry a
poor wife, I should leave you and go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered them
accurately. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind at the time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would say
them, thinking that thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would be driven from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
would be at rest from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) solicitation, from those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friends,
and from the qualms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own conscience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had chosen to claim
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in spite of those words,--and now the thing had happened to
the possibility of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had referred. Poor as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was, Walter
Marrable was able to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
letter telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that it was so. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart was his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>),--as much
now as it had ever been; and it was impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should not go
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had told Mr. Gilmore herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could never love
again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) loved Walter Marrable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been driven to believe
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could never be his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) wife, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had separated herself from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had separated herself from him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), and persuaded herself that
it would be expedient for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to become the wife of this other man.
But up to this very moment she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had never been able to overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
horror at the prospect. From day to day she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must
give it up, even when they were dinning into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ears the tidings
that Walter Marrable was to marry that girl at Dunripple. But that
had been a falsehood,--an absolute falsehood. There had been no such
thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) bosom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had never been untrue to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Ah! how much
the nobler of the two had he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) been!

<p/>And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had struggled hard to do right,--to think of others more
than of herself;--so to dispose of herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might be of some
use in the world. And it had come to this! It was quite impossible
now that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should marry Harry Gilmore. There had hitherto been
at any rate an attempt on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) part to reconcile herself to that
marriage; but now the attempt was impossible. What right could she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
have to refuse the man she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loved when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
happiness depended on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) love! She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could see it now. With all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
desire to do right, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done foul wrong in accepting Mr. Gilmore.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done foul wrong, though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had complied with the advice of
all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) friends. It could not but have been wrong, as it had brought
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to this,--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). But for the future, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might yet be
right,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) only knew how. That it would be wrong to marry Harry
Gilmore,--to think of marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart was so stirred by
the letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand,--of that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was quite sure.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done the man an injury for which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could never atone. Of
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was well aware. But the injury was done and could not now be
undone. And had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) not told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would
even yet return to Walter Marrable if Walter Marrable were able to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went down stairs, slowly, just before the hour for the children's
dinner, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) friend, with one or two of the bairns, in the
garden. <div class="bookquote">``Janet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have had a letter from Dunripple.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Fenwick looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) face, and saw that it was sad and
sorrowful. <div class="bookquote">``What news, Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My cousin, Gregory Marrable, is--no more; he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) died on Sunday
morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was on the Tuesday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You expected it, I suppose, from your aunt's letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes;--it has been sudden at last, it seems.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Sir Gregory?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) is pretty well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) is getting better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) son;--poor old man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Fenwick was far
too clever not to see that the serious, solemn aspect of Mary's face
was not due altogether to the death of a distant cousin, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
herself did not even remember;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was too wise, also, to refer
to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) presumed to be Mary's special grief at the moment. Mary
was doubtless thinking of the altered circumstances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin
Walter; but it was as well now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should speak as little as
possible about that cousin. Mrs. Fenwick could not turn altogether to
another subject, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would, if possible, divert her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) present thoughts. <div class="bookquote">``Shall you go into mourning?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) asked; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>)
was only your second cousin; but people have ideas so different about
those things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, listlessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were you, I would consult Mr. Gilmore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) has a right to be
consulted. If you do, it should be very slight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go into mourning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, suddenly,--remembering at the
moment what was Walter's position in the household at Dunripple. Then
the tears came up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew not why; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked off
by herself amidst the garden shrubs. Mrs. Fenwick watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
went, but could not quite understand it. Those tears had not been for
a second cousin who had never been known. And then, during the last
few weeks, Mary, in regard to herself, had been prone to do anything
that Mr. Gilmore would advise, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could make up by
obedience for the want of that affection which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) owed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). Now,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought to consult Mr. Gilmore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) flatly
refused to do so.

<p/>Mary came up the garden a few minutes afterwards, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) passed
towards the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) begged to be excused from going into lunch
that day. Lord St. George was coming up to lunch at the vicarage, as
will be explained in the next chapter.




<p/>CHAPTER LX.

<p/>LORD ST. GEORGE IS VERY CUNNING.


<p/>Lord St. George began to throw his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) oil upon the waters in reference
to that unfortunate chapel at Bullhampton a day or two after his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father in the lawyer's chambers. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father had
found himself compelled to yield; had been driven, as it were, by the
Fates, to accord to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son permission to do as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son should think
best. There came to be so serious a trouble in consequence of that
terrible mistake of Packer's, that the poor old Marquis was unable to
defend himself from the necessity of yielding. On that day, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
left his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son at Westminster, when their roads lay into the different
council-chambers of the state, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had prayed hard that the oil might
not be very oily. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son would not bate him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) an inch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
surrender.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is so utterly worthless,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>the Marquis had said, pleading hard as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) enemy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not quite sure, my lord, that you understand the man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div>St.
George had said. <div class="bookquote">``You hate him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), and no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hates you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Horribly!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>ejaculated the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You intend to be as good as you know how to be to all those people
at Bullhampton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I do, St. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, almost with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shouldn't wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) did, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But look at his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) life,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't always easy to look at a man's life. We are always looking
at men's lives, and always making mistakes. The bishop thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
is a good sort of fellow, and the bishop isn't the man to like a
debauched, unbelieving, reckless parson, who, according to your
ideas, must be leading a life of open shame and profligacy. I'm
inclined to think there must be a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Trowbridge/Marquis of Trowbridge</b></font>)</div><p/>The unfortunate Marquis groaned deeply as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) walked away to the
august chamber of the Lords.

<p/>These and such like are the troubles that sit heavy on a man's heart.
If search for bread, and meat, and raiment, be set aside, then,
beyond that, our happiness or misery here depends chiefly on success
or failure in small things. Though a man when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turns into bed may
be sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has unlimited thousands at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) command, though
all society be open to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know himself to be esteemed
handsome, clever, and fashionable, even though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) digestion be good,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have no doctor to deny him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tobacco, champagne, or made dishes,
still, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be conscious of failure there where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has striven to
succeed, even though it be in the humbling of an already humble
adversary, he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) will stretch, and roll, and pine,--a wretched being.
How happy is he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) who can get his (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) fretting done for him (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) by deputy!

<p/>Lord St. George wrote to the parson a few days after his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) interview
with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and Lord Trowbridge occupied the same house in
London, and always met at breakfast; but nothing further was said
between them during the remaining days in town upon the subject. Lord
St. George wrote to the parson, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father had left London for
Turnover before Mr. Fenwick's answer was received.


<p/>MY DEAR SIR,---LRB-Lord St. George had said,-RRB---My father
has put into my hands your letter about the dissenting
chapel at Bullhampton. It seems to me, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has made a
mistake, and that you are very angry. Couldn't we arrange
this little matter without fighting? There is not a
landlord in England more desirous of doing good to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
tenants than my father; and I am quite willing to believe
that there is not an incumbent in England more desirous of
doing good to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) parishioners than you. I leave London
for Wiltshire on Saturday the 11th. If you will meet me I
will drive over to Bullhampton on Monday the 13th.

<p/>Yours truly,

<p/>ST. GEORGE.

<p/>No doubt you'll agree with me in thinking that internecine
fighting in a parish between the landlord and the
clergyman cannot be for the good of the people.


<p/>Thus it was that Lord St. George began to throw his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) oil upon the
waters.

<p/>It may be a doubt whether it should be ascribed to Mr. Fenwick as a
weakness or a strength that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was very susceptible of anger,
and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could maintain his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) anger at glowing heat as long as
fighting continued, it would all evaporate and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) harmless
as a dove at the first glimpse of an olive-branch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew this so
well of himself, that it would sometimes be a regret to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) in the
culmination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wrath that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would not be able to maintain it
till the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) revenge should come. On receiving Lord St.
George's letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) at once sat down and wrote to that nobleman,
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would be happy to see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) at lunch on the Monday
at two o'clock. Then there came a rejoinder from Lord St. George,
saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would be at the vicarage at the hour named.

<p/>Mrs. Fenwick was of course there to entertain the nobleman, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
had never seen before, and during the lunch very little was said
about the chapel, and not a word was said about other causes of
complaint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a terrible building, Mrs. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>Lord St. George had
remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're getting used to it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Fenwick had replied; <div class="bookquote">``and Mr.
Fenwick thinks it good for purposes of mortification.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must see and move the sackcloth and ashes a little further off,''
 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lordship.

<p/>Then they ate their lunch, and talked about the parish, and expressed
a joint hope that the Grinder would be hung at Salisbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now let us go and see the corpus delicti,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar as soon as
they had drawn their chairs from the table.

<p/>The two men went out and walked round the chapel, and, finding it
open, walked into it. Of course there were remarks made by both of
them. It was acknowledged that it was ugly, misplaced, uncomfortable,
detestable to the eye, and ear, and general feeling,--except in so
far as it might suit the wants of people who were not sufficiently
educated to enjoy the higher tone, and more elaborate language of
the Church of England services. It was thus that they spoke to each
other, quite in an aesthetic manner.

<p/>Lord St. George had said as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) entered the chapel, that it must come
down as a matter of course; and the Vicar had suggested that there
need be no hurry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They tell me that it must be removed some day,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, <div class="bookquote">``but
as I am not likely to leave the parish, nobody need start the matter
for a year or two.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>Lord St. George was declaring that advantage
could not be taken of such a concession on Mr. Fenwick's part, when
a third person entered the building, and walked towards them with a
quick step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is Mr. Puddleham, the minister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick; and the
future lord of Bullhampton was introduced to the present owner of the
pulpit under which they were standing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>said the minister, <div class="bookquote">``I am proud, indeed, to have the honour
of meeting your lordship in our new chapel, and of expressing to your
lordship the high sense entertained by me and my congregation of
your noble father's munificent liberality to us in the matter of the
land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div><p/>In saying this Mr. Puddleham never once turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) face upon the
Vicar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) presumed himself at the present moment to be at feud with
the Vicar in most deadly degree. Though the Vicar would occasionally
accost him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) in the village, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) always answered the Vicar as though
they two were enemies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had bowed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) came up the chapel, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had bowed to the stranger. If the Vicar took any of that courtesy
to himself, that was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) fault.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid we were a little too quick there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord St. George/St. George</b></font>)</div>said Lord St. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not, my lord; I hope not. I have heard a rumour; but I have
inquired. I have inquired, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth is, Mr. Puddleham, that we are standing on Mr. Fenwick's
private ground this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite welcome to the use of it, Mr. Puddleham,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the
Vicar. Mr. Puddleham assumed a look of dignity, and frowned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could
not even yet believe that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend the Marquis had made so fatal a
mistake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must build you another chapel,--that will be about the long and
short of it, Mr. Puddleham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord, I should think there must be some--mistake. Some error must
have crept in somewhere, my lord. I have made inquiry--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been a very big error,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>said Lord St. George, <div class="bookquote">``and it has
crept into Mr. Fenwick's glebe in a very palpable form. There is no
use in discussing it, Mr. Puddleham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord St. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why didn't the reverend gentleman claim the ground when the
works were commenced?''  (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>demanded the indignant minister, turning now
for the first time to the Vicar, and doing so with a visage full of
wrath, and a graceful uplifting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) right hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The reverend gentleman was very ignorant of matters with which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
ought to have been better acquainted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very ignorant, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Puddleham. <div class="bookquote">``My lord, I am inclined
to think that we can assert our right to this chapel and maintain it.
My lord, I am of opinion that the whole hierarchy of the Episcopal
Established Church in England cannot expel us. My lord, who will be
the man to move the first brick from this sacred edifice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div>And Mr.
Puddleham pointed up to the pulpit as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) knew well where that
brick was ever to be found when duty required its presence. <div class="bookquote">``My lord,
I would propose that nothing should be done; and then let us see who
will attempt to close this chapel door against the lambs of the Lord
who come here for pasture in their need.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lambs shall have pasture and shall have their pastor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div>said St.
George, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``We'll move this chapel to ground that is our own,
and make everything as right as a trivet for you. You don't want to
intrude, I'm sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Puddleham's eloquence was by no means exhausted; but at last,
when they had left the chapel, and the ground immediately around the
chapel which Mr. Puddleham would insist upon regarding as his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) own,
they did manage to shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord St. George/St. George</b></font>)</div>said Lord St. George, in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) determined
purpose to throw oil upon the waters, <div class="bookquote">``what is this unfortunate
quarrel between you and my father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord St. George/St. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), of course,--and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) has no answer to
make. No doubt you intended to enrage him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) when you wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) that
letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) showed me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly see how good is to be done by angering an old man who
stands high in the world's esteem.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not stood high, my lord, I should probably have passed him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can understand all that,--that one man should be a mark for
another's scorn because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a Marquis, and wealthy. But what I
can't understand is, that such a one as you should think that good
can come from it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what your father has said of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no doubt you both say very hard things of each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said an evil thing of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) behind his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back that I have
not said as strongly to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fenwick, with much of
indignation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you really think that that mitigates the injury done to my
father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord St. George/St. George</b></font>)</div>said Lord St. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has complained of me to the bishop?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--and the bishop took your part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No thanks to your father, Lord St. George. Do you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has
accused me publicly of the grossest vices; that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
has,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has--. There is nothing so bad that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hasn't said it
of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I think you are even with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), Mr. Fenwick, I do
indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I have said, I have said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) face. I have made no accusation
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). Come, my lord, I am willing enough to let bygones be
bygones. If Lord Trowbridge will condescend to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) will drop
all animosity to me, I will forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) the injuries he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) has done me.
But I cannot admit myself to have been wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never knew any man who would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord St. George/St. George</b></font>)</div>said Lord St. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the Marquis will put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hand to me, I will accept it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said
the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to do so on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) behalf,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son.

<p/>And thus the quarrel was presumed to be healed. Lord St. George went
to the inn for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) horse, and the Vicar, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) walked across to the
vicarage, felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been--done. This young lord had been very
clever,--and had treated the quarrel as though on even terms, as if
the offences on each side had been equal. And yet the Vicar knew very
well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been right,--right without a single slip,--right
from the beginning to the end. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) has been clever,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said to
himself, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) shall have the advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) cleverness.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
resolved that as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was concerned the quarrel should in truth
be over.




<p/>CHAPTER LXI.

<p/>MARY LOWTHER``S TREACHERY.


<p/>While the Vicar was listening to the eloquence of Mr. Puddleham in
the chapel, and was being cozened out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) just indignation by Lord
St. George, a terrible scene was going on in the drawing-room of
the vicarage. Mary Lowther, as the reader knows, had declared that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would wear mourning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) distant cousin, and had declined to
appear at lunch before Lord St. George. Mrs. Fenwick, putting these
things together, knew that much was the matter, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not know
how much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not as yet anticipate the terrible state of things
which was to be made known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that afternoon.

<p/>Mary was quite aware that the thing must be settled. In the first
place she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must answer Captain Marrable's letter. And then it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
bounden duty to let Mr. Gilmore know her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew it
herself. It might be easy enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to write to Walter Marrable.
That which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would be pleasant enough in the
saying. But that could not be said till the other thing should be
unsaid. And how was that unsaying to be accomplished? Nothing could
be done without the aid of Mrs. Fenwick; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was afraid of
Mrs. Fenwick,--as the guilty are always afraid of those who will have
to judge their guilt. While the children were at dinner, and while
the lord was sitting at lunch, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) remained up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own room. From
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) window she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could see the two men walking across the vicarage
grounds towards the chapel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend would be
alone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) story must be told to Mrs. Fenwick, and to Mrs. Fenwick
only. It would be impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) determination
before the Vicar till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) should have received a first notice of it
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife. And there certainly must be no delay. The men were
hardly out of sight before she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had resolved to go down at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
looked at herself in the glass, and spunged the mark of tears from
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes, and smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair, and then descended. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never before
had felt so much in fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) friend; and yet it was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) friend
who was mainly the cause of this mischief which surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and
who had persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to evil. At Janet Fenwick's instance she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had
undertaken to marry a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not love; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) feared
to go to Janet Fenwick with the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) repentance. Why not
indignantly demand of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend assistance in extricating herself
from the injury which that friend had brought upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) found Mrs. Fenwick with the children in the little breakfast
parlour to which they had been banished by the coming of Lord St.
George. <div class="bookquote">``Janet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>LOWTHER</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``come and take a turn with me in the
garden.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was now the middle of August, and life at the vicarage
was spent almost as much out of doors as within. The ladies went
about with parasols, and would carry their hats hanging in their
hands. There was no delay therefore, and the two were on the
gravel-path almost as soon as Mary's request was made. <div class="bookquote">``I did not
show you my letter from Dunripple,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pocket; <div class="bookquote">``but I might as well do so now. You will have to read
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took out the document, but did not at once hand it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
companion. <div class="bookquote">``Is there anything wrong, Mary?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wrong. Yes;--very, very wrong. Janet, it is no use your talking to
me. I have quite made up my mind. I cannot and I will not marry Mr.
Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary, this is insanity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may say what you please, but I am determined. I cannot and I
will not. Will you help me out of my difficulty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not in the way you mean;--certainly not. It cannot be
either for your good or for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). After what has passed, how on earth
could you bring yourself to make such a proposition to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know; that is what I feel the most. I do not know how
I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) must be told. I thought that perhaps Mr.
Fenwick would do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) will do nothing of the kind. Think of it, Mary.
How can you bring yourself to be so false to a man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not been false to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I have been false to myself, but never
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) how it was. When you drove me on--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Drove you on, Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not mean to be ungrateful, or to say hard things; but when
you made me feel that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were satisfied I also might put up with
it, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that I could never love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that I did
love, and ever should love, Walter Marrable. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) that I had
nothing--nothing--nothing to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would take no answer
but the one; and I did--I did give it him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). I know I did; and I have
never had a moment of happiness since. And now has come this letter.
Janet, do not be cruel to me. Do not speak to me as though everything
must be stern and hard and cruel.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) handed up the letter, and
Mrs. Fenwick read it as they walked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) to be made a tool, because the other man has changed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mind?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter has never changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) plans, then. It comes to the same thing. Do you know that you
will have to answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) life, or for his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) reason? Have you not
learned yet to understand the constancy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) nature?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it my fault that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) should be constant? I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
offered to me that if Walter were to come back to me and ask me
again, I should go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) in spite of any promise that I had made. I
said so as plain as I am saying this to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) did not understand it so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Janet, indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No man would have submitted himself to an engagement with such a
condition. It is quite impossible. What! Mr. Gilmore knew when you
took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) that if this gentleman should choose to change his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind at
any moment before you were actually married, you would walk off and
go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) so, Janet. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will not deny that I told him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) so. When
I told him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) so, I was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would have declined such an
engagement. But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not, and I had no way of escape. Janet, if you
could know what I have been suffering, you would not be cruel to me.
Think what it would have been to you to have to marry a man you did
not love, and to break the heart of one you did love. Of course Mr.
Gilmore is your friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) is our friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, of course, you do not care for Captain Marrable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never even saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you might put yourself in my place, and judge fairly between us.
There has not been a thought or a feeling in my heart concealed from
you since first all this began. You have known that I have never
loved your friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that, after full consideration, you have accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); and
I know also, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is a man who will devote his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) whole life to make
you happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can never be. You may as well believe me. If you will not help
me, nor Mr. Fenwick, I must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) myself;--or I must write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
and leave the place suddenly. I know that I have behaved badly. I
have tried to do right, but I have done wrong. When I came here I was
very unhappy. How could I help being unhappy when I had lost all that
I cared for in the world? Then you told me that I might at any rate
be of some use to some one, by marrying your friend. You do not know
how I strove to make myself fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)! And then, at last, when
the time came that I had to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), I thought that I would tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) everything. I thought that if I told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the truth he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would see
that we had better be apart. But when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), as
I imagined, no choice but to reject me,--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) chose to take me. Well,
Janet; at any rate, then, as I was taught to believe, there was no
one to be ruined by this,--no one to be broken on the wheel,--but
myself: and I thought that if I struggled, I might so do my duty that
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might be satisfied. I see that I was wrong, but you should not
rebuke me for it. I had tried to do as you bade me. But I did tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that if ever this thing happened I should leave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). It has
happened, and I must leave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Fenwick had let her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) speak on
without interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), intending when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had finished, to say
definitely, that they at the vicarage could not make themselves
parties to any treason towards Mr. Gilmore; but when Mary had come to
the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) story her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend's heart was softened towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
walked silently along the path, refraining at any rate from those
bitter arguments with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had at first thought to confound Mary
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) treachery. <div class="bookquote">``I do think you love me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then help me; do help me. I will go on my knees to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to beg his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
pardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know what to say to it. Begging his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pardon will be of no
avail. As for myself, I should not dare to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). We used to
think, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was hopeless before, that dwelling on it all would
drive him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to some absolute madness. And it will be worse now. Of
course it will be worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>Mary paused a moment, and then added,
sharply,--<div class="bookquote">``There is one thing I will not do; I will not go to the
altar and become his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I had better tell Frank,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick, after another
pause.

<p/>This was, of course, what Mary Lowther desired, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) begged for
and obtained permission not to see the Vicar herself that evening.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own room that night, and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) the next morning
before prayers as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) might.

<p/>When the Vicar came back to the house, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) mind was so full of the
chapel, and Lord St. George, and the admirable manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
been cajoled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wrath without the slightest admission on the
part of the lord that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father had ever been wrong,--his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thoughts
were so occupied with all this, and with Mr. Puddleham's oratory,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) did not at first give his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) wife an opportunity of telling Mary
Lowther's story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall all of us have to go over to Turnover next week,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may go. I won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shouldn't wonder if the Marquis were to offer me a better
living, so that I might be close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>). We are to be the lamb and
the wolf sitting down together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And which is to be the lamb?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That does not matter. But the worst of it is, Puddleham won't come
and be a lamb too. Here am I, who have suffered pretty nearly as
much as St. Paul, have forgiven all my enemies all round, and shaken
hands with the Marquis by proxy, while Puddleham has been man enough
to maintain the dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) indignation. The truth is, that the
possession of a grievance is the one state of human blessedness. As
long as the chapel was there, malgre moi, I could revel in my wrong.
It turns out now that I can send poor Puddleham adrift to-morrow,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) immediately becomes the hero of the hour. I wish your
brother-in-law had not been so officious in finding it all out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Fenwick postponed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) story till the evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Mary?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Fenwick asked, when dinner was announced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is not quite well, and will not come down. Wait awhile, and you
shall be told.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did wait; but the moment that they were alone
again he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) question. Then Mrs. Fenwick told the whole story,
hardly expressing an opinion herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) told it. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is to be shaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is behaving very badly,--very badly,--very badly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not quite sure, Frank, whether we have behaved wisely,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it must be told him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), it will drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it must be told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am to tell it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say that I have made up my mind; but, as far as I can see at
present, I will do nothing of the kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has no right to expect
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Before they went to bed, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) also had been somewhat softened.
When his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife declared, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would never
interfere at match-making again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) began to perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) also
had endeavoured to be a match-maker and had failed.




<p/>CHAPTER LXII.

<p/>UP AT THE PRIVETS.


<p/>The whole of the next day was passed in wretchedness by the party at
the vicarage. The Vicar, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) greeted Miss Lowther in the morning,
had not meant to be severe, having been specially cautioned against
severity by his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been unable not to be silent and
stern. Not a word was spoken about Mr. Gilmore till after breakfast,
and then it was no more than a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would think better of this, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think better of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) replied.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) refused, however, to go to Mr. Gilmore that day, demanding that
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should have another day in which to revolve the matter in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
mind. It was understood, however, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) persisted he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would
break the matter to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lover. Then this trouble was aggravated by
the coming of Mr. Gilmore to the vicarage, though it may be that the
visit was of use by preparing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) in some degree for the blow. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) came Mary was not to be seen. Fancying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) might call, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
remained up-stairs all day, and Mrs. Fenwick was obliged to say that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was unwell. <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) really ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the poor man had asked. Mrs.
Fenwick, driven hard by the difficulty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) position, had said
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did not believe Mary to be very ill, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was so
discomposed by news from Dunripple that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could not come down. <div class="bookquote">``I
should have thought that I might have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore,
with that black frown upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) brow which now they all knew so well.
Mrs. Fenwick made no reply, and then the unhappy man went away. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wanted no further informant to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the woman to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
pledged regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) engagement to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with aversion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) again before I go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Fenwick said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife the next
morning. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) did see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). But Mary was absolutely firm. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
remarked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was pale and worn and ill, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) acknowledged that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes during those two nights.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it must be so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) asked, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so grieved that you should have such a mission,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) replied.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was not thinking of himself, sad as
the occasion would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). But if this great sorrow could have
been spared to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend! It could not, however, be spared. Mary was
quite firm, at any rate as to that. No consideration should induce
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) now to marry Mr. Gilmore. Mr. Fenwick, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) behalf, might
express his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) regret for the grief she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had caused in any terms that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might think fit to use,--might humiliate her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to the ground if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
thought it proper. And yet, had not Mr. Gilmore sinned more against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) than had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) against him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)? Had not the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had
grasped at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand been unmanly and unworthy? But of this, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought much of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said nothing now to Mr. Fenwick. This
commission to the Vicar was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) should make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) free; and in
doing this he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might use what language, and make what confessions he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
pleased. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) must, however, make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) free.

<p/>After breakfast he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) started upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) errand with a very heavy heart.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend dearly. Between these two there had grown up now
during a period of many years, that undemonstrative, unexpressed,
almost unconscious affection which, with men, will often make the
greatest charm of their lives, but which is held by women to be quite
unsatisfactory and almost nugatory. It may be doubted whether either
of them had ever told the other of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) regard. <div class="bookquote">``Yours always,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in
writing, was the warmest term that was ever used. Neither ever
dreamed of suggesting that the absence of the other would be a cause
of grief or even of discomfort. They would bicker with each other,
and not unfrequently abuse each other. Chance threw them much
together, but they never did anything to assist chance. Women, who
love each other as well, will always be expressing their love, always
making plans to be together, always doing little things each for the
gratification of the other, constantly making presents backwards and
forwards. These two men had never given any thing, one to the other,
beyond a worn-out walking-stick, or a cigar. They were rough to each
other, caustic, and almost ill-mannered. But they thoroughly trusted
each other; and the happiness, prosperity, and, above all, the honour
of the one were, to the other, matters of keenest moment. The bigger
man of the two, the one who felt rather than knew himself to be the
bigger, had to say that which would go nigh to break his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend's
heart, and the task which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had in hand made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sick at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked slowly across the fields, turning over in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
mind the words he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would use. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misery for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend was infinitely
greater than any that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had suffered on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own account, either in
regard to Mr. Puddleham's chapel or the calumny of the Marquis.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) found Gilmore sauntering about the stable yard. <div class="bookquote">``Old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``come along, I have got something to say to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is about Mary, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes; it is about Mary. You mustn't be a woman, Harry, or let a
woman make you seriously wretched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it all. That will do. You need not say anything more.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) hands into the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) shooting coat, and walked
off as though all had been said that was necessary. Fenwick had told
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) message and might now go away. As for himself, in the sharpness
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) agony he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had as yet made no scheme for a future purpose. Only
this he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had determined. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would see that false woman once again, and
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conduct.

<p/>But Fenwick knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) task was not yet done. Gilmore might walk
off, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was bound to follow the unhappy man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you had better let me come with you for awhile.
You had better hear what I have to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to hear nothing more. What good can it be? Like a fool, I
had set my fortune on one cast of the die, and I have lost it. Why
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should have added on the misery and disgrace of the last few
weeks to the rest, I cannot imagine. I suppose it has been her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way of
punishing me for my persistency.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has not been that, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows what it has been. I do not understand it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had turned
from the stables towards the house, and had now come to a part of
the grounds in which workmen were converting a little paddock in
front of the house into a garden. The gardener was there with four or
five labourers, and planks, and barrows, and mattocks, and heaps of
undistributed earth and gravel were spread about. <div class="bookquote">``Give over with
this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) said to the gardener, angrily. The man touched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, and
stood amazed. <div class="bookquote">``Leave it, I say, and send these men away. Pay them for
the work, and let them go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean as we are to leave it all like this, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do mean that you are to leave it just as it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>There was a man
standing with a shovel in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand levelling some loose earth, and
the Squire, going up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), took the shovel from him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) and threw it
upon the ground. <div class="bookquote">``When I say a thing, I mean it. Ambrose, take these
men away. I will not have another stroke of work done here.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div>The
Vicar came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) and whispered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) ear a prayer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
would not expose himself before the men; but the Squire cared nothing
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) friend's whisper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) shook off the Vicar's hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) arm
and stalked away into the house.

<p/>Two rooms, the two drawing-rooms as they were called, on the ground
floor had been stripped of the old paper, and were now in that state
of apparent ruin which always comes upon such rooms when workmen
enter them with their tools. There were tressels with a board across
them, on which a man was standing at this moment, whose business it
was to decorate the ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``You may get down, and leave the
place.''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man stood still on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) board with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes open and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
brush in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I have changed my mind, and you may come down,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gilmore. <div class="bookquote">``Tell Mr. Cross to send me his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) bill for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has
done, and it shall be paid. Come down, when I tell you. I will have
nothing further touched in the house.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) went from room to room and
gave the same orders, and, after a while, succeeded in turning the
paper-hangers and painters out of the house. Fenwick had followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) from room to room, making every now and then an attempt at
remonstrance; but the Squire had paid no attention either to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
words or to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) presence.

<p/>At last they were alone together in Gilmore's own study or office,
and then the Vicar spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am, indeed, surprised
that such a one as you should not have more manhood at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) command.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you ever tried as I am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What matters that? You are responsible for your own conduct, and I
tell you that your conduct is unmanly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I have the rooms done up? I shall never live here.
What is it to me how they are left? The sooner I stop a useless
expenditure the better. It was being done for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), not for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you will live here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know nothing about it. You cannot know anything about it. Why
has she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) treated me in this way? To send up to a man and simply tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has changed her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mind! God in heaven!--that you should
bring me such a message!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not allowed me to give my message yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it me, then, and have done with it. Has she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) not sent you to
tell me that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has changed her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Now that opportunity was given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), the Vicar did not know how
to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) message. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it would have been better that Janet
should have come to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It don't make much difference who comes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>)'ll never come again. I
don't suppose, Frank, you can understand the sort of love I have had
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>). You have never been driven by failure to such longing as
mine has been. And then I thought it had come at last!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you be patient while I speak to you, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar,
again taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) by the arm. They had now left the house, and were
out alone among the shrubs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Patient! yes; I think I am patient. Nothing further can hurt me
now;--that's one comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary bids me remind you,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>--Gilmore shuddered and shook himself when
Mary Lowther's name was mentioned, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) did not attempt to stop the
Vicar,--<div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bids me remind you that when the other day she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) consented
to be your wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did so--.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) tried to tell it all, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could
not. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) tell the man the story which Mary had told to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore. <div class="bookquote">``It's all of no use, and you are
troubling yourself for nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not care a
straw for me;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) accepted me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that was the case, you were both wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was the case. I don't say who was wrong, but the punishment has
come upon me only. Look here, Frank; I will not take this message
from you. I will not even give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up yet. I have a right, at least,
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) I will. I don't suppose you will try to
prevent me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pleases, Harry, as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is in my house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shall see me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is self-willed enough, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shall not
refuse me that. Be so good as to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with my compliments, that I
expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to see me. A man is not going to be treated like this, and
then not speak his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own mind. Be good enough to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that from me.
I demand an interview.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) turned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) heel, and walked
quickly away through the shrubbery.

<p/>The Vicar stood for awhile to think, and then slowly returned to the
vicarage by himself. What Gilmore had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was true enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
had, indeed, never been tried after that fashion. It did seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend was in fact broken-hearted. Harry Gilmore might live
on,--as is the way with men and women who are broken-hearted;--but
life for the present, life for some years to come, could be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
only a burden.




<p/>CHAPTER LXIII.

<p/>THE MILLER TELLS HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) TROUBLES.


<p/>When the Vicar went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) unhappy mission to the Squire's house
Carry Brattle had been nearly two months at the mill. During that
time both Mr. and Mrs. Fenwick had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) more than once, and at
last she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had been persuaded to go to church with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) sister. On the
previous Sunday she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had crept through the village at Fanny's side,
and had taken a place provided for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) in the dark corner of a dark
pew under the protection of a thick veil. Fanny walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
boldly across the village street, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) were not in any
slightest degree ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) companion, and sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) side, and
then conveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) home. On the next Sunday the sacrament would be
given, and this was done in preparation for that day.

<p/>Things had not gone very pleasantly at the mill. Up to this moment
old Brattle had expressed no forgiveness towards his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) daughter, had
uttered no word of affection to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), had made no sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had
again taken her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) bosom as his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own child. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>),
because in the narrow confines of their home it was almost impossible
that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) should live in the house with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) without doing so. Carry had
gradually fallen into the way of doing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) share of the daily work.
She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cooked, and baked, and strove hard that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) presence in the house
should be found to be a comfort. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was useful, and the very fact of
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) utility brought her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father into a certain state of communion with
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) specially, never called her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
name, and had not yet even acknowledged to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife or to Fanny that
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as one of the family. They had chosen to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
in against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not turn their guest from the door.
It was thus that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed to regard his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter's presence in the
mill-house.

<p/>Under this treatment Carry was becoming restive and impatient. On
such an occasion as that of going to church and exposing herself to
the eyes of those who had known her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as an innocent, laughing, saucy
girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not but be humble, quiet, and awestruck; but at home
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was beginning again gradually to assert her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own character. <div class="bookquote">``If
father won't speak to me, I'd better go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said to Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And where will you go to, Carry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dun' know;--into the mill-pond would be best for them as belongs
to me. I suppose there ain't anybody as 'd have me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody can have you as will love you as we do, Carry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why won't father come round and speak to me? You can't tell what
it is to have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looking at one that way. I sometimes feels like
getting up and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to turn me out if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't speak a word to
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>But Fanny had softened her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wait
still again, explaining the sorrow that weighed upon their father's
heart as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could without saying a single cruel word as to
Carry's past life. Fanny's task was not easy, and it was made the
harder by their mother's special tenderness towards Carry. <div class="bookquote">``The less
she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says and the more she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does, the better for her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Fanny to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't let her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) talk about father.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Brattle
did not attempt to argue the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) elder daughter, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
found it to be quite out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) power to restrain Carry's talking.

<p/>During these two months old Brattle had not even seen either his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
landlord or the Vicar. They had both been at the mill, but the
miller had kept himself up among his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) grist, and had not condescended
to come down to them. Nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) even, since Carry's return, been
seen in Bullhampton, or even up on the high road leading to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
held no communion with men other than was absolutely necessary for
his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) business, feeling himself to be degraded, not so much by his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
daughter's fall as by his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) concession to his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) fallen daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) would
sit out in the porch of an evening, and smoke his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) pipe; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
heard a footstep on the lane he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) would retreat, and cross the plank
and get among the wheels of his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) mill, or out into the orchard. Of
Sam nothing had been heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was away, it was believed in Durham,
working at some colliery engine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) gave no sign of himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
mother or sister; but it was understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would appear at
the assizes, towards the end of the present month, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had been
summoned there as a witness at the trial of the two men for the
murder of Mr. Trumbull.

<p/>And Carry, also, was to be a witness at the assizes; and, as it was
believed, a witness much more material than her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother. Indeed, it
was beginning to be thought that after all Sam would have no evidence
to give. If, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had had nothing to do with the murder, it was
not probable that any of the circumstances of the murder would have
been confided to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had, it seemed, been on intimate terms with
the man Acorn,--and, through Acorn, had known Burrows and the old
woman who lived at Pycroft Common, the mother of Burrows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) had been
in their company when they first visited Bullhampton, and had, as we
know, invited them into the Vicar's garden,--much to the damage of
Mr. Burrows' shoulder-blade; but it was believed that beyond this he (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>)
could say nothing as to the murder. But Carry Brattle was presumed
to have a closer knowledge of at least one of the men. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had now
confessed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sister that, after leaving Bullhampton, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
consented to become Acorn's wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had known then but little of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) mode of life or past history; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) was young, good-looking,
fairly well-dressed, and had promised to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). By him (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
taken to the cottage on Pycroft Common, and by him (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had certainly
been visited on the morning after the murder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) had visited her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and
given her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) money;--and since that, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own story, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
neither seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) nor heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had never cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sister; but what was that to one such as her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as long as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) would make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) an honest woman? All this was repeated by Fanny
Brattle to Mrs. Fenwick;--and now the assizes were at hand, and how
was Carry to demean herself there? Who would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)? Who would
stand near her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) and support her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), and save her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) from falling into that
abyss of self-abasement and almost of self-annihilation which would
be her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) doom, unless there were some one there to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) strength
and aid?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not go to Salisbury at all during the assizes, if I were
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Fenwick had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband. The Vicar understood
thoroughly what was meant. Because of the evil things which had
been said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) by that stupid old Marquis whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had been
cheated into forgiving, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was not to be allowed to give a helping
hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) parishioner! Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) acknowledged his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) wife's
wisdom,--tacitly, as is fitting when such acknowledgments have to be
made; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) contented himself with endeavouring to find for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) some
other escort. It had been hoped from day to day that the miller would
yield, that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) would embrace poor Carry, and promise her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
should again be to him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) as a daughter. If this could be brought about,
then,--so thought the Vicar and Fanny too,--the old man would steel
himself to bear the eyes of the whole county, and would accompany the
girl himself. But now the day was coming on, and Brattle seemed to be
as far from yielding as ever. Fanny had dropped a word or two in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hearing about the assizes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had only glowered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), taking no
other notice whatever of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hints.

<p/>When the Vicar left his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend Gilmore, as has been told in the last
chapter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) did not return to the vicarage across the fields, but
took the carriage road down to the lodge, and from thence crossed the
stile that led into the path down to the mill. This was on the 15th
of August, a Wednesday, and Carry was summoned to be at Salisbury on
that day week. As the day drew near she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) became very nervous. At the
Vicar's instance Fanny had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother George, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would be good to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) poor sister, and take her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
charge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had written back,--or rather his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife had written for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>),--sending Carry a note for L20 as a present, but declining, on
the score of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own children, to be seen with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in Salisbury on
the occasion. <div class="bookquote">``I shall go with her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) myself, Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>Fanny had
said to the Vicar; <div class="bookquote">``it'll just be better than nobody at all to be
along with her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>The Vicar was now going down to the mill to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
assent to this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could see nothing better. Fanny at any rate would
be firm; would not be prevented by false shame from being a very
sister to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister; and would perhaps be admitted where a brother's
attendance might be refused. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had promised to see the women at the
mill as early in the week as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went thither intent
on giving them advice as to their proceedings at Salisbury. It would
doubtless be necessary that they should sleep there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hoped
that they might be accommodated by Mrs. Stiggs.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stepped out from the field path on to the lane, almost
immediately in front of the mill, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came directly upon the miller.
It was between twelve and one o'clock, and old Brattle was wandering
about for a minute or two waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dinner. The two men met
so that it was impossible that they should not speak; and on this
occasion the miller did not seem to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) visitor. <div class="bookquote">``Muster
Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) took the Vicar's hand, <div class="bookquote">``I am bound to say
as I'm much obliged to ye for all y' have done for that poor lass in
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say a word about that, Mr. Brattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must say a word. There's money owing as I knows. There was ten
shilling a week for her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) keep all that time she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) was at Salsbry
yonder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not hear a word as to any money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) brother George has sent her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) a gift, Muster Fenwick,--twenty
pound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George is a well-to-do man, they tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>continued the father,
<div class="bookquote">``and can afford to part with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't come forward to
help the girl any other gait. I'll thank you just to take what's due,
Muster Fenwick, and you can give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sister the change. Our Fanny has
got the note as George sent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there was a dispute about the money, as a matter of course.
Fenwick swore that nothing was due, and the miller protested that as
the money was there all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) daughter's expenses at Salisbury should
be repaid. And the miller at last got the best of it. Fenwick
promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would look to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) book, see how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had paid,
and mention the sum to Fanny at some future time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) positively
refused to take the note at present, protesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had no
change, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would not burden himself with the responsibility
of carrying so much money about with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) pocket. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) asked
whether, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) went into the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would be able to say a word or
two to the women before dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would
make no further attempt at reconciling the father to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
had often declared to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife that there could be nothing so hateful
to a man as the constant interference of a self-constituted adviser.
<div class="bookquote">``I so often feel that I am making myself odious when I am telling
them to do this or that; and then I ask myself what I should say
if anybody were to come and advise me how to manage you and the
bairns.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) wife more than once how very natural and
reasonable had been the expression of the lady's wrath at Startup,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) had taken upon himself to give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) advice. <div class="bookquote">``People know what
is good for them to do, well enough, without being dictated to by a
clergyman!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) had repeated the words to himself and to his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) wife a
dozen times, and talked of having them put up in big red letters over
the fire-place in his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) own study. He (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) had therefore quite determined to
say never another word to old Brattle in reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) daughter
Carry. But now the miller himself began upon the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can see 'em, Muster Fenwick, in course. It don't make no odds
about dinner. But I was wanting just to say a word to you about that
poor young ooman there.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) said in a slow, half-hesitating
voice, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) could hardly bring himself to speak of the
unfortunate one to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) alluded. The Vicar muttered some word of
assent, and then the miller went on. <div class="bookquote">``You knows, of course, as how
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) be back here at the mill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I do. I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) more than once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Muster Fenwick, I don't suppose as any one as asn't tried it knows
what it is. I hopes you mayn't never know it; nor it ain't likely.
Muster Fenwick, I'd sooner see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dead body stretched afore me,--and
I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a`most as well as any father ever loved his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) da`ter,--I'd
sooner a see'd her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brought home to the door stiff and stark than know
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to be the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) hesitation had now given way to
emphasis, and he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) spoke. The Vicar caught it and
held it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own, and strove to find some word to say as the old
man paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) speech. But to Jacob Brattle it was hard for a
clergyman to find any word to say on such an occasion. Of what use
could it be to preach of repentance to one who believed nothing; or
to tell of the opportunity which forgiveness by an earthly parent
might afford to the sinner of obtaining lasting forgiveness
elsewhere? But let him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) have said what he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) might, the miller would not
have listened. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was full of that which lay upon his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) own heart. <div class="bookquote">``If
they only know'd what them as cares for 'em 'd has to bear, maybe
they'd think a little. But it ain't natural they should know, Muster
Fenwick, and one's a`most tempted to say that a man 'd better have no
child at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of your son George, Mr. Brattle, and of Mrs. Jay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's them to me? He (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) sends the girl a twenty-pun'-note, and I wish
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)'d a kep' it. As for t`other, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wouldn't let the girl inside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
door! It's here she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What comfort would you have, Mr. Brattle, without Fanny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny! I'm not saying nothing against Fanny. Not but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hadn't
no business to let the girl into the house in the middle of the night
without saying a word to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister outside in the cold and damp
all night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) come and ax? All the same, I ain't a saying nowt
again Fanny. But, Muster Fenwick, if you ever come to have one foot

ain't got it. Y'll have the pain a gnawing of you from the bad foot
till you clean forget all the rest o' your body. It's so with me, I
knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I say to you, Mr. Brattle? I do feel for you. I do,--I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a doubt on it, Muster Fenwick. They all on 'em feels for me.
They all on 'em knows as how I'm bruised and mangled a`most as though

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence, Mr. Brattle. You shall not say it. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is not that;--at any

deserted as well as virtue?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ain't easy to leave disgrace behind, any ways. For ought I

comes one can't send 'em away just because they is hardest of all to

to say as it broke me;--but I'm about broke now. If I hadn't more nor
a crust at home, nor a decent coat to my back, I'd a looked 'em all
square in the face as ever I did. But I can't look no man square

near me,--no how. They makes me think of my own.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Fenwick had now
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) back to the miller, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might wipe away his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
tears without showing them. <div class="bookquote">``I'm thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) always, Muster
Fenwick;--day and night. When the mill's agoing, it's all the same.
It's just as though there warn't nothing else in the whole world as I
minded to think on. I've been a man all my life, Muster Fenwick; and
now I ain't a man no more.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``It's in here, Muster Fenwick,--in here.'' (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>Our friend the Vicar never before felt himself so utterly unable to
administer comfort in affliction. There was nothing on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could
take hold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could tell the man, no doubt, that beyond all this
there might be everlasting joy, not only for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), but for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) and the
girl together;--joy which would be sullied by no touch of disgrace.
But there was a stubborn strength in the infidelity of this old Pagan
which was utterly impervious to any adjuration on that side. That
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) saw and knew and felt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) would believe; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) would
believe nothing else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) knew now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) was wounded and sore and
wretched, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) understood the cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) must bear his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>)
misery to the last, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) struggled to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) back broad for the
load. But even the desire for ease, which is natural to all men,
would not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) flinch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) infidelity. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) would not believe
when things went well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>), and when the comfort of hope for the
future was not imperatively needed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) daily solace,--so would he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>)
not believe now, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) need for such comfort was so pressing.

<p/>The upshot of it all was, that the miller thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) would take
his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) own daughter into Salisbury, and was desirous of breaking the
matter in this way to the friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) family. The Vicar, of course,
applauded him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) much. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) applauded too much;--for the miller
turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) and declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was by no means certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
was doing right. And when the Vicar asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) to be gentle with the
girl, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) been gentle along of me? I hates such gentility,
Muster Fenwick. I'll be honest with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), any way.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) thought
better of it before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) let the Vicar go. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't do her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) no hurt,
Muster Fenwick. Bad as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s been, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s my own flesh and blood
still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had heard, Mr. Fenwick declined going into the
mill-house, and returned home without seeing Mrs. Brattle and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
daughters. The miller's determination should be told by himself; and
the Vicar felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could hardly keep the secret were he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) now to
see the women.




<p/>CHAPTER LXIV.

<p/>IF I WERE YOUR SISTER!


<p/>Mr. Gilmore in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) last words to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend Fenwick, declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
would not accept the message which the Vicar delivered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) as the
sufficient expression of Mary's decision. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would see Mary Lowther
herself, and force her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to confess her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own treachery face to face with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>),--to confess it or else to deny it. So much she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could not refuse
to grant him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). Fenwick had indeed said that as long as the young lady
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) guest she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must be allowed to please herself as to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
would see or not see. Gilmore should not be encouraged to force
himself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at the vicarage. But the Squire was quite sure that
so much as that must be granted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). It was impossible that even
Mary Lowther should refuse to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) after what had passed between
them. And then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) walked about his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own fields, thinking of
it all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) allowed himself to feel a certain amount of hope that
after all she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) might be made to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had not
dwindled,--or rather his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) desire to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own, and to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife; but it had taken an altered form out of which all its
native tenderness had been pressed by the usage to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been
subjected. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) honour rather than his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) love that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) now desired
to satisfy. All those who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) best were aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had set
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heart upon this marriage, and it was necessary to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
should show them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was not to be disappointed. Mary's conduct
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) from the day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had first engaged herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had
been of such a kind as naturally to mar his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) tenderness and to banish
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) all those prettinesses of courtship in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would have
indulged as pleasantly as any other man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in so many
words that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) intended to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) without loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and on these
terms he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). But in doing so he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had unconsciously
flattered himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) words,--that
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) submitted herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) affianced bride she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would
gradually become soft and loving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had, if possible,
been harder to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) even than her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) words. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) understand
thoroughly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) presence was not a joy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
engagement to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was a burden on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had taken on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
shoulders simply because the romance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life had been nipped
in the bud in reference to the man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did love. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
persevered. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had set his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart sturdily on marrying this girl,
and marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would, if, after any fashion, such marriage should
come within his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power. Mrs. Fenwick, by whose judgment and affection
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been swayed through all this matter, had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again and
again, that such a girl as Mary Lowther must love her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) husband,--if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) husband loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) and treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) with tenderness. <div class="bookquote">``I think I
can answer for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>Gilmore had once replied, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend
had thoroughly believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). Trusting to the assurance he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had
persevered; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had persevered even when his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) trust in that assurance
had been weakened by the girl's hardness. Anything would be better
than breaking from an engagement on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had so long rested all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) hopes of happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was pledged to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wife; and, that
being so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could reform his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) gardens and decorate his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) house, and
employ himself about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) place with some amount of satisfaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
had at least a purpose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) life. Then by degrees there grew upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) a fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still meant to escape from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) swore
to himself,--without any tenderness,--that this should not be
so. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) once be his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wife and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should be treated with all
consideration,--with all affection, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would accept it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
should not make a fool of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) now. Then the Vicar had come with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
message, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been simply told that the engagement between them
was over!

<p/>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),--and that at once. As soon as Fenwick had
left him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) went with rapid steps over his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) whole place, and set the
men again upon their work. This took place on a Wednesday, and the
men should be continued at their work, at any rate, till Saturday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
explained this clearly to Ambrose, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) gardener, and to the foreman
in the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to Ambrose, <div class="bookquote">``that I shall change my mind
altogether about the place;--but as I am still in doubt, let
everything go on till Saturday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ambrose</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course they all knew why it was that the conduct of the Squire was
so like the conduct of a madman.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) sent down a note to Mary Lowther that evening.


<p/>DEAR MARY,

<p/>I have seen Fenwick, and of course I must see you. Will
you name an hour for to-morrow morning?

<p/>Yours, H. G.


<p/>When Mary read this, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did as they were sitting on the lawn
after dinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not hesitate for a moment. Hardly a word had
been said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) by Fenwick, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) return from the
Privets. They did not wish to show themselves to be angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),
but they found conversation to be almost impossible. <div class="bookquote">``You have told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>Mary had asked. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>the Vicar had replied;
and that had been nearly all. In the course of the afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had hinted to Janet Fenwick that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had better leave
Bullhampton. <div class="bookquote">``Not quite yet, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Fenwick had said, and Mary
had been afraid to urge her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) request.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I name eleven to-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) handed the Squire's
note to Mrs. Fenwick. Mrs. Fenwick and the Vicar both assented, and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) went in and wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) answer.


<p/>I will be at home at the vicarage at eleven.--M. L.


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would have given much to escape what was coming, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had not
expected to escape it.

<p/>The next morning after breakfast Fenwick himself went away. <div class="bookquote">``I've had
more than enough of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) said, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``and I won't be near
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Fenwick was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend up to the moment at which the bell
was heard at the front door. There was no coming up across the lawn
now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Janet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>Mary said, when they were alone, <div class="bookquote">``how I wish that I had
never come to trouble you here at the vicarage!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Fenwick was not without a feeling that much of all this
unhappiness had come from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own persistency on behalf of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
husband's friend, and thought that some expression was due from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
to Mary to that effect. <div class="bookquote">``You are not to suppose that we are angry
with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arm round Mary's waist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray,--pray do not be angry with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fault has been too much ours for that. We should have left this
alone, and not have pressed it. We have meant it for the best, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have meant to do right;--but, Janet, it is so hard to do
right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/>When the ring at the door was heard, Mrs. Fenwick met Harry
Gilmore in the hall, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would find Mary in the
drawing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) hand warmly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
face, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) spoke no word as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) passed on to the room which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
just left. Mary was standing in the middle of the floor, half-way
between the window and the door, to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard
the door-bell she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) held it
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was approaching; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dropped it and stood without
support, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face upraised to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very
quickly and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) by the hand. <div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am not to
believe this message that has been sent to me. I do not believe
it. I will not believe it. I will not accept it. It is out of the
question;--quite out of the question. It shall be withdrawn, and
nothing more shall be said about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That cannot be, Mr. Gilmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What cannot be? I say that it must be. You cannot deny, Mary,
that you are betrothed to me as my wife. Are such betrothals to be
nothing? Are promises to go for nothing because there has been no
ceremony? You might as well come and tell me that you would leave me
even though you were my wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am not your wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it mean? Have I not been patient with you? Have I been
hard to you, or cruel? Have you heard anything of me that is to my
discredit?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Then what does it mean? Are
you aware that you are proposing to yourself to make an utter wreck
of me--to send me adrift upon the world without a purpose or a hope?
What have I done to deserve such treatment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) pleaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) cause very well,--better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
plead a cause before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) still by the hand, not with a grasp
of love, but with a retention which implied his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) will that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should
not pass away from out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) full in the face,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not quail before his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) eyes. Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have
given the world to have been elsewhere, and to have been free from
the necessity of answering him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been fortifying herself
throughout the morning with self-expressed protests that on no
account would she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) yield, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been right before or
wrong;--of this she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was convinced, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must be right now to save
herself from a marriage that was so distasteful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have deserved nothing but good at my hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is this good that you are doing to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--certainly. It is the best that I know how to do now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it to be done now? What is it that has changed you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and waited a while before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
answered. It was necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) all the tidings
that had been conveyed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in the letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had received
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin Walter; but in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) should perfectly
understand them and be made to know their force upon herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must
remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) of the stipulation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had made when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) consented
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) engagement. But how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) speak words which would seem
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) to be spoken only to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) of the abjectness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
submission to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was broken-hearted when I came here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore you would leave me broken-hearted now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should spare me, Mr. Gilmore. You remember what I told you. I
loved my cousin Walter entirely. I did not hide it from you. I begged
you to leave me because it was so. I told you that my heart would not
change. When I said so, I thought that you would--desist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am to be punished, then, for having been too true to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not defend myself for accepting you at last. But you must
remember that when I did so I said that I should go--back--to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) could take me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are going back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) will have me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can stand there and look me in the face and tell me that you
are false as that! You can confess to me that you will change like a
weathercock;--be his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) one day, and then mine, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) again the next!
You can own that you give yourself about first to one man, and then
to another, just as may suit you at the moment! I would not have
believed it of any woman. When you tell it me of yourself, I begin
to think that I have been wrong all through in my ideas of a woman's
character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The time had now come in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must indeed speak up. And speech
seemed to be easier with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had allowed himself to
express his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had expressed more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had dared
to shower his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) scorn upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and the pelting of the storm gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
courage. <div class="bookquote">``You are unjust upon me, Mr. Gilmore,--unjust and cruel. You
know in your heart that I have not changed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you not betrothed to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was;--but in what way? Have I told you any untruth? Have I
concealed anything? When I accepted you, did I not explain to
you how and why it was so,--against my own wish, against my own
judgment,--because then I had ceased to care what became of me. I do
care now. I care very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think that is justice to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will bandy accusations with me, why did you accept me when
I told you that I could not love you? But, indeed, indeed, I would
not say a word to displease you, if you would only spare me. We were
both wrong; but the wrong must now be put right. You would not wish
to take me for your wife when I tell you that my heart is full of
affection for another man. Then, when I yielded, I was struggling to
cure that as a great evil. Now I welcome it as the sweetest blessing
of my life. If I were your sister, what would you have me do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) stood silent for a moment, and then the colour rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
forehead as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If you were my sister, my ears would
tingle with shame when your name was mentioned in my presence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The blood rushed also over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face, suffusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whole countenance,
forehead and all, and fire flashed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips were
parted, and even her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nostrils seemed to swell with anger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked
full into his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) face for a second, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned and walked
speechless away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). When the handle of the door was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned again to address him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gilmore,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I
will never willingly speak to you again.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then the door was opened
and closed behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) before a word had escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) lips.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had uttered words
so hard, that it might be doubted whether, under any circumstances,
they could be justified from a gentleman to a lady. And certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
had not intended to insult her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was coming down to the vicarage.
As far as any settled purpose had been formed in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
meant to force her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) engagement with himself, by showing to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) how manifest would be her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) injustice, and how great her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) treachery,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) persisted in leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) character well
enough to be aware that any word of insult addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as a
woman, would create offence which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) herself would be unable to
quell. But his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) anger had got the better of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) judgment, and when
the suggestion was made to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) of a sister of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took the
opportunity which was offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) of hitting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
force. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had felt the blow, and had determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would never
encounter another.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was left alone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must retreat. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) waited a while, thinking
that perhaps Mrs. Fenwick or the Vicar would come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>); but nobody
came. The window of the room was open, and it was easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) to
leave the house by the garden. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) prepared to do so, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) eye
caught the writing materials on a side table, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) sat down and
addressed a note to Mrs. Fenwick. <div class="bookquote">``Tell Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that in
a matter which to me is of life and death, I was forced to speak
plainly. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), also, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will be my wife, I know well
that I shall never have to blush for a deed of hers,--or for a
word,--or for a thought.--H. G.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) went out on to the lawn, and
returned home by the path at the back of the church farm.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had left the vicarage, making another offer for the girl's hand,
as it were, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) last gasp. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) went, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) told himself that
it was impossible that it should be accepted. Every chance had now
gone from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) must look his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) condition in the face as best
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could. It had been bad enough with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) before, when no hope had
ever been held out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>); when the answers of the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) loved had
always been adverse to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>); when no one had been told that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was to
be his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) bride. Even then the gnawing sense of disappointment and of
failure,--just there, when only he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) cared for success,--had been more
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could endure without derangement of the outer tranquillity of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) life. Even then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been unable so to live that men should not
know that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) sorrow had disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had gone to Loring,
travelling with a forlorn hope into the neighbourhood of the girl
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) loved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had himself been aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had lacked strength to
control himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) misfortune. But if his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) state then had been
grievous, what must it be now? It had been told to all the world
around him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had at last won his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) bride, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had proceeded,
as do jolly thriving bridegrooms, to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) house ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
reception. Doubting nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had mingled her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) wishes, her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) tastes,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), with every action of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had prepared
jewels for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), and decorated chambers, and laid out pleasure
gardens. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was a man, simple in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own habits, and not given to
squandering his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) means; but now, at this one moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) life, when
everything was to be done for the delectation of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) who was to be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) life's companion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could afford to let prudence go by the
board. True that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) pleasure in doing this had been sorely marred by
her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) coldness, by her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) indifference, even by her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) self-abnegation; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had continued to buoy himself up with the idea that all would come
right when she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) should be his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
would never willingly speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) again,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) house, and into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) bedroom, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) sat
thinking of it all. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) heard the voices and the
tools of the men at their work; and knew that things were being
done which, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), would never be of avail. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) remained there
for a couple of hours without moving. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) got up and gave the
housekeeper instructions to pack up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) portmanteau, and the groom
orders to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) gig to the door. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) was going away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) letters were to be addressed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) club in London. That
afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) drove himself into Salisbury that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) might catch the
evening express train up, and that night he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) slept at a hotel in
London.




<p/>CHAPTER LXV.

<p/>MARY LOWTHER LEAVES BULLHAMPTON.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration-RSB-

<p/>It was considerably past one o'clock, and the children's dinner was
upon the table in the dining parlour before anyone in the vicarage
had seen Mary Lowther since the departure of the Squire. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
left Mr. Gilmore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own room, and no one had
disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>). As the children were being seated, Fenwick returned,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) hand the note which Gilmore had left for
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What passed between them?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) asked in a whisper.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wife shook her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I have not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>)
talks of speaking plainly, and I suppose it was bitter enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) can be very bitter if he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>)'s driven hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar; <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>)
has been driven very hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) added, after a while.

<p/>As soon as the children had eaten their dinner, Mrs. Fenwick went up
to Mary's room with the Squire's note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) knocked, and
was at once admitted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) found Mary sitting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) writing-desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you not come to lunch, Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--if I ought. I suppose I might not have a cup of tea brought up
here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have whatever you like,--here or anywhere else, as far as
the vicarage goes. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) say to you this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is of no use that I should tell you, Janet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not yield to him (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, I did not. Certainly I never shall yield to him (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>). Dear
Janet, pray take that as a certainty. Let me make you sure at any
rate of that. He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) must be sure of it himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is his (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) note to me, written, I suppose, after you left him (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>Mary took the scrap of paper from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand and read it. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) is not
sure, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Fenwick. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) has written to me, and I
suppose that I must answer him (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) shall certainly never have to blush for me as his (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said
Mary. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friend of the hard words that had
been said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) understood well the allusion in Mr. Gilmore's
note, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not explain it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had determined, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
thought about it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) solitude, that it would be better that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
should never repeat to anyone the cruel words which her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lover had
spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Doubtless he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had received provocation. All his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) anger,
as well as all his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) suffering, had come from a constancy in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) love
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), which was unsurpassed, if not unequalled, in all that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had read of among men. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had been willing to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) on
conditions most humiliating to himself; and had then been told, that,
even with those conditions, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was not to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was bound
to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) almost any offence that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could bestow upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) wrath words which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought to be not
only cruel but unmanly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would never speak
willingly to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) again; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) word. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would
forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was bound to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) any injury, let it be what
it might. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>);--and as a sign to herself of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
pardon she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would say no word of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) offence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friends, the
Fenwicks. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) shall certainly never have to blush for me as his (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet I am bound to hurry myself,--to release him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). And, Janet, will

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) will think but little of that. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would have given you willingly

<p/>Mrs. Fenwick immediately went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) desk, and wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend.


<p/>DEAR HARRY,

<p/>I am sure it is of no use. Knowing how persistent is your
constancy, I would not say so were I not quite, quite
certain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) goes to Loring on Saturday. Will it not be
better that you should come to us for awhile after she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) has
left us. You will be less desolate with Frank than you
would be alone.

<p/>Ever yours,

<p/>JANET FENWICK.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) has left your jewels with me. I merely tell you this
for your information;--not to trouble you with the things
now.


<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) added a second postscript.


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) regrets deeply what you have suffered on her (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>) account,
and bids me beg you to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>FENWICK</b></font>).


<p/>Thus it was settled that Mary Lowther should leave Bullhampton, again
returning to Loring, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had done before, in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) might
escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) suitor. In writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) aunt she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had thought it
best to say nothing of Walter Marrable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had not as yet written
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) cousin, postponing that work for the following day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would
have postponed it longer had it been possible; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) felt herself
to be bound to let him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) reply before he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) left Dunripple. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
would have much preferred to return to Loring, to have put miles
between herself and Bullhampton, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) wrote a letter which
must contain words of happy joy. It would have gratified her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) to have
postponed for awhile all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) future happiness, knowing that it was
there before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), and that it would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) at last. But it could
not be postponed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) cousin's letter was burning her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) pocket. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
already felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was treating him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) badly in keeping it by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
without sending him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) the reply that would make him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could
not bring herself to write the letter till the other matter was
absolutely settled; and yet, all delay was treachery to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>); for,--as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) repeated to herself again and again,--there could be no answer
but one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had, however, settled it all now. On the Saturday
morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would start for Loring, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would write her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) letter
on the Friday in time for that day's post. Walter would still be at
Dunripple on the Sunday, and on the Sunday morning her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) letter would
reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had studied the course of post between Bullhampton and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) lover's future residence, and knew to an hour when her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) letter
would be in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) hands.

<p/>On that afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could hardly maintain the tranquillity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
usual demeanour when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) met the Vicar before dinner. Not a word,
however, was said about Gilmore. Fenwick partly understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife were in some degree responsible for the shipwreck that
had come, and had determined that Mary was to be forgiven,--at any
rate by him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife had taken counsel together, and had
resolved that, unless circumstances should demand it, they would
never again mention the Squire's name in Mary Lowther's hearing. The
attempt had been made and had utterly failed, and now there must be
an end of it. On the next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heard that Gilmore had gone up
to London, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) went up to the Privets to learn what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could from
the servants there. No one knew more than that the Squire's letters
were to be directed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) Club. The men were still at work
about the place; but Ambrose told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) that they were all at sea as
to what they should do, and appealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) for orders. <div class="bookquote">``If we shut
off on Saturday, sir, the whole place'll be a muck of mud and nothin'
else all winter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gardener</b></font>)</div>said the gardener. The Vicar suggested that after
all a muck of mud outside the house wouldn't do much harm. <div class="bookquote">``But
master ain't the man to put up with that all`ays, and it'll cost
twice as much to have 'em about the place again arter a bit.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This,
however, was the least trouble. If Ambrose was disconsolate out of
doors, the man who was looking after the work indoors was twice more
so. <div class="bookquote">``If we be to work on up to Saturday night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrose</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and then do
never a stroke more, we be a doing nothing but mischief. Better leave
it at once nor that, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then Fenwick was obliged to take upon
himself to give certain orders. The papering of the rooms should be
finished where the walls had been already disturbed, and the cornices
completed, and the wood-work painted. But as for the furniture,
hangings, and such like, they should be left till further orders
should be received from the owner. As for the mud and muck in the
garden, his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) only care was that the place should not be so left as to
justify the neighbours in saying that Mr. Gilmore was demented. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) would be able to get instructions from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend, or perhaps to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), in time to save danger in that respect.

<p/>In the meantime Mary Lowther had gone up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) room, and seated
herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) blotting-book and pens and ink. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had now before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) the pleasure,--or was it a task?--of answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) cousin's
letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had that letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) hand, and had already read it
twice this morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) would so well know how
to answer it; but, now that the pen was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) found that
the thing to be done was not so easy. How much must she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) tell him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and
how should she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) tell it? It was not that there was anything which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
desired to keep back from him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was willing,--nay, desirous,--that
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should know all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had said, and done, and thought; but it
would have been a blessing if all could have been told to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) by
other agency than her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would not condemn her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>). Nor, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own conduct back from one scene to another, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
condemn herself. Yet there was that of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) could not write
without a feeling of shame. And then, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) be happy, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had caused so much misery? And how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) write her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) letter
without expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) happiness? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) wished that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own identity
might be divided, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) might rejoice over Walter's love with
the one moiety, and grieve with the other at all the trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had
brought upon the man whose love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had been so constant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) sat
with the open letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) hand, thinking over all this, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
told herself at last that no further thinking could avail her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
must bend herself over the table, and take the pen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) hand, and
write the words, let them come as they would.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) thought, must be longer than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a knack of
writing short letters; and then there had been so little for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
say. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had merely a single question to ask; and, although he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
asked it more than once,--as is the manner of people in asking such
questions,--still, a sheet of note-paper loosely filled had sufficed.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) read it again. <div class="bookquote">``If you bid me, I will be with you early next
week.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>What if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nothing, but only bade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)?
After all, would it not be best to write no more than that? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) pen, and in three minutes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) letter was completed.


<p/>The Vicarage, Friday.

<p/>DEAREST, DEAREST WALTER,

<p/>Do come to me,--as soon as you can, and I will never send
you away again. I go to Loring to-morrow, and, of course,
you must come there. I cannot write it all; but I will
tell you everything when we meet. I am very sorry for your
cousin Gregory, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was so good.

<p/>Always your own,

<p/>MARY.

<p/>But do not think that I want to hurry you. I have said
come at once; but I do not mean that so as to interfere
with you. You must have so many things to do; and if I get
one line from you to say that you will come, I can be ever
so patient. I have not been happy once since we parted.
It is easy for people to say that they will conquer their
feelings, but it has seemed to me to be quite impossible
to do it. I shall never try again.


<p/>As soon as the body of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) letter was written, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could have
continued her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) postscript for ever. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) then as though
nothing would be more delightful than to let the words flow on with
full expressions of all her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) love and happiness. To write to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was
pleasant enough, as long as there came on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) no need to mention Mr.
Gilmore's name.

<p/>That was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) last evening at Bullhampton; and though no
allusion was made to the subject, they were all thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
could never return to Bullhampton again. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had been almost as much
at home with them as with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) aunt at Loring; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) must leave
the place for ever. But they said not a word; and the evening passed
by almost as had passed all other evenings. The remembrance of what
had taken place since she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had been at Bullhampton made it almost
impossible to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) departure.

<p/>In the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was to be again driven to the railway-station at
Westbury. Mr. Fenwick had work in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) parish which would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
at home, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was to be trusted to the driving of the groom. <div class="bookquote">``If
I were to be away to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) that
evening, <div class="bookquote">``the churchwardens would have me up to the archdeacon, and
the archdeacon might tell the Marquis, and where should I be then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) not to give it a second thought. <div class="bookquote">``Dear
Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I should of all things have liked to have seen the
last of you,--that you might know that I love you as well as ever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) burst into tears, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>), and told him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
would always look to him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) as to a brother.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) called Mrs. Fenwick into her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own room before she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) undressed.
<div class="bookquote">``Janet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``dearest Janet, we are not to part for ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For ever! No, certainly. Why for ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never see you, unless you will come to me. Promise me that
if ever I have a house you will come to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you will have a house, Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will come and see me,--will you not? Promise that you will

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXVI.

<p/>AT THE MILL.


<p/>The presence of Carry Brattle was required in Salisbury for the trial
of John Burrows and Lawrence Acorn on Wednesday the 22nd of August.
Our Vicar, who had learned that the judges would come into the city
only late on the previous evening, and that the day following their
entrance would doubtless be so fully occupied with other matters as
to render it very improbable that the affair of the murder would
then come up, had endeavoured to get permission to postpone Carry's
journey; but the little men in authority are always stern on such
points, and witnesses are usually treated as persons who are not
entitled to have any views as to their own personal comfort or
welfare. Lawyers, who are paid for their presence, may plead other
engagements, and their pleas will be considered; and if a witness be
a lord, it may perhaps be thought very hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) should be dragged
away from his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) amusements. But the ordinary commonplace witness must
simply listen and obey--at his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) peril. It was thus decided that Carry
must be in Salisbury on the Wednesday, and remain there, hanging
about the Court, till her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) services should be wanted. Fenwick, who had
been in Salisbury, had seen that accommodation should be provided for
her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and for the miller at the house of Mrs. Stiggs.

<p/>The miller had decided upon going with his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) daughter. The Vicar did
not go down to the mill again; but Mrs. Fenwick had seen Brattle, and
had learned that such was to be the case. The old man said nothing to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own people about it till the Monday afternoon, up to which time
Fanny was prepared to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was then told, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
came in from the mill for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tea, that word had come down from the
vicarage that there would be two bed-rooms for them at Mrs. Stiggs'
house. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know why there should be the cost of a second room,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Fanny; <div class="bookquote">``Carry and I won't want two beds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>Up to this time there had been no reconciliation between the miller
and his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) younger daughter. Carry would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father whether she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
should do this or that, and the miller would answer her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as a surly
master will answer a servant whom he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) does not like; but the father,
as a father, had never spoken to the child; nor, up to this moment,
had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said a word even to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) intended journey to
Salisbury. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was driven to speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had placed himself in
the arm chair, and was sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knees gazing
into the empty fire-grate. Carry was standing at the open window,
pulling the dead leaves off three or four geraniums which her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother
kept there in pots. Fanny was passing in and out from the back
kitchen, in which the water for their tea was being boiled, and Mrs.
Brattle was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) usual place with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) spectacles on, and a darning
needle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) hand. A minute was allowed to pass by before the miller
answered his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) eldest daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There'll be two beds wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I told Muster Fenwick as I'd
go with the girl myself;--and so I wull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Carry started so that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) broke the flower which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was touching.
Mrs. Brattle immediately stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) needle, and withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
spectacles from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) nose. Fanny, who was that instant bringing the
tea-pot out of the back kitchen, put it down among the tea cups, and
stood still to consider what she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had heard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, coming up to him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>), and just touching him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand; <div class="bookquote">''`twill be best for you to go, much best. I am heartily
glad on it, and so will Carry be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knows nowt about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller; <div class="bookquote">``but I mean to go, and
that's all about it. I ain't a been to Salsbry these fifteen year and
more, and I shan't be there never again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no saying that, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it ain't for no pleasure as I'm agoing now. Nobody 'll s`pect
that of me. I'd liever let the millstone come on my foot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing more said about it that evening, nothing more at
least in the miller's hearing. Carry and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister were discussing
it nearly the whole night. It was very soon plain to Fanny that Carry
had heard the tidings with dismay. To be alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father for
two, three, or perhaps four days, seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be so terrible,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hardly knew how to face the misery and gloom of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
company,--in addition to the fears she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had as to what they would say
and do to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in the Court. Since she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had learned
almost to tremble at the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father's foot; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
known that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not harm her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), would hardly notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), would not
do more than look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). But now, for three long frightful days to
come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would be subject to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrath during every moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) speak to me, Fanny, d'ye think?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll speak to you, child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hasn't, you know,--not since I've been home; not once; not as
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does to you and mother. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hates me, and wishes I was dead.
And, Fanny, I wishes it myself every day of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wishes nothing of the kind, Carry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say one kind word to me, then? I know I've been bad.
But I ain't a done a single thing since I've been home as 'd a' made
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) angry if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seed it, or said a word as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mightn't a' heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you have, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why can't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) come round, if it was ever so little? I'd sooner
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d beat me; that I would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll never do that, Carry. I don't know as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ever laid a hand upon
one of us since we was little things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It 'd be better than never speaking to a girl. Only for you and
mother, Fan, I'd be off again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not. You know you would not. How dare you say that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) say a word to one, so that one shouldn't go
about like a dead body in the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carry dear, listen to this. If you'll manage well; if you'll be good
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>), and patient while you are with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>); if you'll bear with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>),
and yet be gentle when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am gentle,--always,--now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are, dear; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) speaks, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>)'ll have to speak when
you're all alone like, be very gentle. Maybe, Carry, when you've come
back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) will be gentle with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had ever so much more to discuss. Would Sam be at the trial?
And, if so, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father speak to each other? They had
both been told that Sam had been summoned, and that the police would
enforce his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) attendance; but they were neither of them sure whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would be there in custody or as a free man. At last they went to
sleep, but Carry's slumbers were not very sound. As has been told
before, it was the miller's custom to be up every morning at five.
The two girls would afterwards rise at six, and then, an hour after
that, Mrs. Brattle would be instructed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) time had come. On
the Tuesday morning, however, the miller was not the first of the
family to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) bed. Carry crept out of hers by the earliest
dawn of daylight, without waking her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) sister, and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) clothes
stealthily. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) way silently to the front door, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) opened, and stood there outside waiting till her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father should
come. The morning, though it was in August, was chill, and the time
seemed to be very long. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had managed to look at the old clock as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) passed, and had seen that it wanted a quarter to five. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) knew
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father was never later than five. What, if on this special
morning he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should not come, just because she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had resolved, after many
inward struggles, to make one great effort to obtain his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pardon.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was coming. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) step in the passage, and then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had stopped when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found the fastenings of
the door unloosed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) perceived too that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) delayed to examine the
lock,--as it was natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should do; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had forgotten
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be arrested by the open door. Thinking of this in the
moment of time that was allowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) hurried forward and
encountered him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it is I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was angry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) should have dared to unbolt the door, or to
withdraw the bars. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) should be trusted to open
or to close the house? And there came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) some idea of wanton
and improper conduct. Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) there at that hour? Must it be that
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should put her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) again from the shelter of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) roof?

<p/>Carry was clever enough to perceive in a moment what was passing in
the old man's mind. <div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it was to see you. And I
thought,--perhaps,--I might say it out here.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) at
once. In whatever spirit he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) present effort, that
other idea had already vanished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was there that they two might be
alone together in the fresh morning air, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that it was so.
<div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said, looking up into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) fell on the
ground at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, and embraced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, and lay there sobbing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had intended to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for forgiveness, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was not able to
say a word. Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speak for awhile; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stooped and raised
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) up tenderly; and then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was again standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stepped on as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were going to the mill without a word. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had not rebuked her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) touch had been very gentle. <div class="bookquote">``Father,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said, following him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if you could forgive me! I know I have been
bad, but if you could forgive me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to the very door of the mill before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), paused upon the bridge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
had used all her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) eloquence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) knew no other words with which to
move him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had failed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could do no more. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped again without entering the mill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Child,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``come here, then.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) ran at once to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I will forgive thee. There. I will forgive thee, and trust thou
may`st be a better girl than thou hast been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) flew to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face
and breast. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I will be good. I will try to be
good. Only you will speak to me.''


 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I will be good.'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get thee into the house now. I have forgiven thee.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So saying he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
passed on to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) morning's work.

<p/>Carry, running into the house, at once roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``Fanny,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has forgiven me at last; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has said that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will
forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But to the miller's mind, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) sense of justice, the
forgiveness thus spoken did not suffice. When he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) returned to
breakfast, Mrs. Brattle had, of course, been told of the morning's
work, and had rejoiced greatly. It was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) as though the greatest
burden of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) life had now been taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) weary back. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) girl,
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) loving motherly heart, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) who had in all things been
the lord of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) life had vouchsafed his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) pardon to the poor sinner,
would be as pure as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had played about the mill in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
girlish innocence. The mother had known that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) child was still
under a cloud, but the cloud to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had consisted in the father's
wrath rather than in the feeling of any public shame. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) a sin
repented was a sin no more, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) child made her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) sure
of the sincerity of that repentance. But there could be no joy over
the sinner in this world till the head of the house should again have
taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) heart. When the miller came in to his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) breakfast the
three women were standing together, not without some outward marks of
contentment. Mrs. Brattle's cap was clean, and even Fanny, who was
ever tidy and never smart, had managed in some way to add something
bright to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) appearance. Where is the woman who, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has been
pleased, will not show her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pleasure by some sign in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) outward
garniture? But still there was anxiety. <div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) call me Carry?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the
girl had asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) had not done so when he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pardon
at the mill door. Though they were standing together they had not
decided on any line of action. The pardon had been spoken and they
were sure that it would not be revoked; but how it would operate at
first none of them had even guessed.

<p/>The miller, when he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) had entered the room and come among them, stood
with his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) two hands resting on the round table, and thus he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) addressed
them: <div class="bookquote">``It was a bad time with us when the girl, whom we had all loved
a`most too well, forgot herself and us, and brought us to shame,--we
who had never known shame afore,--and became a thing so vile as I
won't name it. It was well nigh the death o' me, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Brattle</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your peace, Fanny, and let me say my say out. It was very
bad then; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) come back to us, and was took in, so that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bit to eat under an honest roof, it was bad
still;--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was a shame to us as had never been shamed afore. For
myself I felt so, that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was allays near me, my heart was
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not one with me, not as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister is one,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother, who never know'd a thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart as wasn't fit
for a woman to have there.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>By this time Carry was sobbing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
mother's bosom, and it would be difficult to say whose affliction was
the sharpest. <div class="bookquote">``But them as falls may right themselves, unless they be
chance killed as they falls. If my child be sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sin--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father, I am sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will bring myself to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). That it won't stick here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>and
the miller struck his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) heart violently with his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) open palm, <div class="bookquote">``I won't be
such a liar as to say. For there ain't no good in a lie. But there
shall be never a word about it more out o' my mouth,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) may
come to me again as my child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a solemnity about the old man's speech which struck them
all with so much awe that none of them for a while knew how to move
or to speak. Fanny was the first to stir, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) came to him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) and put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) and leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get me my breakfast, girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). But before he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) had moved
Carry had thrown herself weeping on his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) bosom. <div class="bookquote">``That will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``That will do. Sit down and eat thy victuals.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then there was
not another word said, and the breakfast passed off in silence.

<p/>Though the women talked of what had occurred throughout the day, not
a word more dropped from the miller's mouth upon the subject. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) came in to dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) food from Carry's hand and thanked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),--as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) would have thanked his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) elder daughter,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) did not
call her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) name. Much had to be done in preparing for the
morrow's journey, and for the days through which they two might be
detained at the assizes. The miller had borrowed a cart in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was to drive himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) daughter to the Bullhampton road
station, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) went to bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) determination of
starting at nine, so as to catch a certain train into Salisbury. They
had been told that it would be sufficient if they were in the city
that day at one o'clock.

<p/>On the next morning the miller was in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) mill as usual in the
morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) said nothing about the work, but the women knew that it
must in the main stand still. Everything could not be trusted to one
man, and that man a hireling. But nothing was said of this. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went
into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mill, and the women prepared his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breakfast, and the clean
shirt and the tidy Sunday coat in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to travel. And Carry
was ready dressed for the journey;--so pretty, with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bright curls
and sweet dimpled cheeks, but still with that look of fear and sorrow
which the coming ordeal could not but produce. The miller returned,
dressed himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was desired, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place at the table in
the kitchen; when the front door was again opened,--and Sam Brattle
stood among them!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I've turned up just in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course the consternation among them was great; but no reference
was made to the quarrel which had divided the father and son when
last they had parted. Sam explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had come across the
country from the north, travelling chiefly by railway, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
had walked from the Swindon station to Marlborough on the preceding
evening, and from thence to Bullhampton that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had come by
Birmingham and Gloucester, and thence to Swindon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, mother, if you'll give me a mouthful of some'at to eat, you
won't find that I'm above eating of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had been summoned to Salisbury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said, for that day, but nothing
should induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) to go there till the Friday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) surmised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
knew a thing or two, and as the trial wouldn't come off before Friday
at the earliest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) wouldn't show his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) face in Salisbury before that
day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) strongly urged Carry to be equally sagacious, and used some
energetic arguments to the same effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) found
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father was also to be at the assizes; but the miller did not
like to be taught by his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) son, and declared that as the legal document
said Wednesday, on the Wednesday his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) daughter should be there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about the mill?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>asked Sam. The miller only shook his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Then there's only so much more call for me to stay them two days,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Sam. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be at it hammer and tongs, father, till it's time for
me to start o' Friday. You tell 'em as how I'm coming. I'll be there
afore they want me. And when they've got me they won't get much out
of me, I guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>To all this the miller made no reply, not forbidding his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) son to work
the mill, nor thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) for the offer. But Mrs. Brattle and Fanny,
who could read every line in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) face, knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was well-pleased.

<p/>And then there was the confusion of the start. Fanny, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
solicitude for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father, brought out a little cushion for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
seat. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want no cushion to sit on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``give it here to
Carry.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) name, and
it was not lost on the poor girl.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVII.

<p/>SIR GREGORY MARRABLE HAS A HEADACHE.


<p/>Mary Lowther, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) aunt, had in one line told the
story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) rupture with Mr. Gilmore. This line had formed a
postscript, and the writer had hesitated much before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) added it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had not intended to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) aunt on this subject; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)
had remembered at the last moment how much easier it would be to tell
the remainder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) story on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) arrival at Loring, if so much had
already been told beforehand. Therefore it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had added
these words. <div class="bookquote">``Everything has been broken off between me and Mr.
Gilmore--for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a terrible blow upon poor Miss Marrable, who, up to the
moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) receiving that letter, thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) niece was
disposed of in the manner that had seemed most desirable to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
friends. Aunt Sarah loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) niece dearly, and by no means looked
forward to improved happiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) own old age when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) should be
left alone in the house at Uphill; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) entertained the view about
young women which is usual with old women who have young women under
their charge, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) thought it much best that this special young
woman should get herself married. The old women are right in their
views on this matter; and the young women, who on this point are not
often refractory, are right also. Miss Marrable, who entertained a
very strong opinion on the subject above-mentioned, was very unhappy
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was thus abruptly told by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own peculiar young woman that
this second engagement had been broken off and sent to the winds. It
had become a theory on the part of Mary's friends that the Gilmore
match was the proper thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). At last, after many difficulties,
the Gilmore match had been arranged. The anxiety as to Mary's future
life was at an end, and the theory of the elders concerned with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) welfare was to be carried out. Then there came a short note,
proclaiming her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) return home, and simply telling as a fact almost
indifferent,--in a single line,--that all the trouble hitherto taken
as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own disposition had entirely been thrown away. <div class="bookquote">``Everything
has been broken off between me and Mr. Gilmore.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was a cruel and a
heartrending postscript!

<p/>Poor Miss Marrable knew very well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was armed with no parental
authority. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) theory, and could advise; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could
do no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) could not even scold. And there had been some qualm
of conscience on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) part as to Walter Marrable, now that Walter
Marrable had been taken in hand and made much of by the baronet,--and
now, also, that poor Gregory had been removed from the path. No doubt
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), Aunt Sarah, had done all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) power to aid the difficulties
which had separated the two cousins;--and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) thought that the
Gilmore match had been the consequence of such aiding on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) part,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was happy enough in reflecting upon what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had done. Old Sir
Gregory would not have taken Walter by the hand unless Walter had
been free to marry Edith Brownlow; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) could not quite
resolve that the death of the younger Gregory had been part of the
family arrangement due to the happy policy of the elder Marrables
generally, still she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was quite sure that Walter's present position
at Dunripple had come entirely from the favour with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had
regarded the baronet's wishes as to Edith. Mary was provided for with
the Squire, who was in immediate possession; and Walter with his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
bride would become as it were the eldest son of Dunripple. It was
all as comfortable as could be till there came this unfortunate
postscript.

<p/>The letter reached her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) on Friday, and on Saturday Mary arrived. Miss
Marrable determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would not complain. As regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own
comfort it was doubtless all for the best. But old women are never
selfish in regard to the marriage of young women. That the young
women belonging to them should be settled,--and thus got rid of,--is
no doubt the great desire; but, whether the old woman be herself
married or a spinster, the desire is founded on an adamantine
confidence that marriage is the most proper and the happiest thing
for the young woman. The belief is so thorough that the woman would
cease to be a woman, would already have become a brute, who would
desire to keep any girl belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out of matrimony for the
sake of companionship to herself. But no woman does so desire in
regard to those who are dear and near to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). A dependant, distant
in blood, or a paid assistant, may find here and there a want of the
true feminine sympathy; but in regard to a daughter, or one held as
a daughter, it is never wanting. <div class="bookquote">``As the pelican loveth her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) young do
I love thee; and therefore will I give thee away in marriage to some
one strong enough to hold thee, even though my heartstrings be torn
asunder by the parting.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>Such is always the heart's declaration of
the mother respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter. The match-making of mothers is
the natural result of mother's love; for the ambition of one woman
for another is never other than this,--that the one loved by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
shall be given to a man to be loved more worthily. Poor Aunt Sarah,
considering of these things during those two lonely days, came to the
conclusion that if ever Mary were to be so loved again that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might
be given away, a long time might first elapse; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was aware
that such gifts given late lose much of their value, and have to be
given cheaply.

<p/>Mary herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was driven slowly up the hill to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt's
door, did not share her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt's melancholy. To be returned as a bad
shilling, which has been presented over the counter and found to be
bad, must be very disagreeable to a young woman's feelings. That was
not the case with Mary Lowther. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had, no doubt, a great sorrow
at heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had created a shipwreck which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) did regret most
bitterly. But the sorrow and the regret were not humiliating, as they
would have been had they been caused by failure on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own part. And
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) the strong comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) own rock, of which
nothing should now rob her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>),--which should be a rock for rest and
safety, and not a rock for shipwreck, and as to the disposition of
which Aunt Sarah's present ideas were so very erroneous!

<p/>It was impossible that the first evening should pass without a word
or two about poor Gilmore. Mary knew well enough that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) renewed engagement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not bring herself at once to utter a song of triumph, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have done had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) blurted out all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) story. Not a word
was said about either lover till they were seated together in the
evening. <div class="bookquote">``What you tell me about Mr. Gilmore has made me so unhappy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Marrable, sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It could not be helped, Aunt Sarah. I tried my best, but it could
not be helped. Of course I have been very, very unhappy myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't pretend to understand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet it is so easily understood!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, pleading hard for
herself. <div class="bookquote">``I did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I had. It is so natural that you should think that I have
behaved badly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not said so, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that, Aunt Sarah; but if you think so,--and of course you
do,--write and ask Janet Fenwick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) will tell you everything. You
know how devoted she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) is to Mr. Gilmore. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) would have done anything
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). But even she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) will tell you that at last I could not help
it. When I was so very wretched I thought that I would do my best
to comply with other people's wishes. I got a feeling that nothing
signified for myself. If they had told me to go into a convent or to
be a nurse in a hospital I would have gone. I had nothing to care
for, and if I could do what I was told perhaps it might be best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why did you not go on with it, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was impossible--after Walter had written to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Walter is to marry Edith Brownlow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear aunt; no. Walter is to marry me. Don't look like that, Aunt
Sarah. It is true;--it is, indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had now dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chair
close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt's seat upon the sofa, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt's knees. <div class="bookquote">``All that about Miss Brownlow has been a
fable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Parson John told me that it was fixed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not fixed. The other thing is fixed. Parson John tells many
fables. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is to come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is to come here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter,--of course. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) is to be here,--I don't know how soon; but I
shall hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). Dear aunt, you must be good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>);--indeed you
must. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) is your cousin just as much as mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am, Aunt Sarah. Oh dear, how much I am in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)! It
never changed in the least, though I struggled, and struggled not to
think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). I broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) picture and burned it;--and I would not
have a scrap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) handwriting;--I would not have near me anything
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had even spoken of. But it was no good. I could not get away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) for an hour. Now I shall never want to get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
again. As for Mr. Gilmore, it would have come to the same thing at
last, had I never heard another word from Walter Marrable. I could
not have done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we must submit to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Aunt Sarah</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Sarah, after a pause.
This certainly was not the most exhilarating view which might have
been taken of the matter as far as Mary was concerned; but as it did
not suggest any open opposition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) scheme, and as there was no
refusal to see Walter when he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) should again appear at Uphill as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
lover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made no complaint. Miss Marrable went on to inquire how
Sir Gregory would like these plans, which were so diametrically
opposed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) own. As to that, Mary could say nothing. No doubt
Walter would make a clean breast of it to Sir Gregory before he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) left
Dunripple, and would be able to tell them what had passed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
came to Loring. Mary, however, did not forget to argue that the
ground on which Walter Marrable stood was his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own ground. After the
death of two men, the youngest of whom was over seventy, the property
would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) property, and could not be taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). If Sir
Gregory chose to quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>),--as to the probability of which,
Mary and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt professed very different opinions,--they must wait.
Waiting now would be very different from what it had been when their
prospects in life had not seemed to depend in any degree upon the
succession to the family property. <div class="bookquote">``And I know myself better now
than I did then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``Though it were to be for all my life,
I would wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On the Monday she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin. It was very short,
and there was not a word in it about Sir Gregory or Edith Brownlow.
It only said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was the happiest man in the world, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>)
would be at Loring on the following Saturday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) must return at once
to Birmingham, but would certainly be at Loring on Saturday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) had
written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) uncle to ask for hospitality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) did not suppose that
Parson John would refuse; but should this be the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would put
up at The Dragon. Mary might be quite sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) on
Saturday.

<p/>And on the Saturday he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) came. The parson had consented to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>);
but, not thinking highly of the wisdom of the proposed visit, had
worded his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) letter rather coldly. But of that Walter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) present
circumstances thought but little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was hardly within the house
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) story. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't heard, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``that Mary and I have made it up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How made it up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,--I mean that you shall make us man and wife some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought you were to marry Edith Brownlow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told you that, sir? I am sure Edith did not, nor yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) mother.
But I believe these sort of things are often settled without
consulting the principals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does my brother say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Gregory, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I mean Sir Gregory. I don't suppose you'd ask your
father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never had the slightest intention, sir, of asking either one or
the other. I don't suppose that I am to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) leave to be married,
like a young girl; and it isn't likely that any objection on family
grounds could be made to such a woman as Mary Lowther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't ask leave of any one, most noble Hector. That is a
matter of course. You can marry the cook-maid to-morrow, if you
please. But I thought you meant to live at Dunripple?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I shall,--part of the year; if Sir Gregory likes it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that you were to have an allowance and all that sort of thing.
Now, if you do marry the cook-maid--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to marry the cook-maid,--as you know very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) can do as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pleases. The moment that it was settled I told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) complained of headache. Sir Gregory very often does complain of
headache. When I took leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) said I should hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it's all up with Dunripple for you,--as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) lives. I've

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends entirely upon Sir Gregory. You may be sure of this,
sir,--that I shall ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) for nothing. If the worst comes to the
worst, I can go to the Jews as well as my father. I won't, unless I
am driven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was with Mary, of course, that evening, walking again along the
banks of the Lurwell, as they had first done now nearly twelve months
since. Then the autumn had begun, and now the last of the summer
months was near its close. How very much had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), or had
seemed to happen, during the interval. At that time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had thrice
declined Harry Gilmore's suit; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had done so without any weight
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own conscience. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) friends had wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to marry the man,
and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been troubled; but the trouble had lain light
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked back at it all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt that at that
time there had been something of triumph at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart. A girl when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is courted knows at any rate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is thought worthy of
courtship, and in this instance she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been at least courted
worthily. Since then a whole world of trouble had come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
from that source. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been driven hither and thither, first by
love, and then by a false idea of duty, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had come almost to
shipwreck. And in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tossing she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had gone against another barque
which, for aught she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew, might even yet go down from the effects of
the collision. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not be all happy, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were again
leaning on Walter Marrable's arm, or again sitting with it round her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
waist, beneath the shade of the trees on the banks of the Lurwell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we must wait, and this time we must be patient,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) of poor Sir Gregory's headache.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot ask him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) for anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div>said Walter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. Do not ask anybody for anything,--but just wait. I
have quite made up my mind that forty-five for the gentleman, and
thirty-five for the lady, is quite time enough for marrying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The grapes are sour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Marrable/Marrable</b></font>)</div>said Walter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not sour at all, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was speaking of my own grapes, as I look at them when I use that
argument for my own comfort. The worst of it is that when we know
that the grapes are not sour,--that they are the sweetest grapes in
the world,--the argument is of no use. I won't tell any lies about
it, to myself or anybody else. I want my grapes at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div>said Mary, eagerly; <div class="bookquote">``of course I do. I am not going to
make any pretence with you. Of course I want them at once. But I have
learned to know that they are precious enough to be worth the waiting
for. I made a fool of myself once; but I shall not do it again, let
Sir Gregory make himself ever so disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>This was all very pleasant for Captain Marrable. Ah, yes! what other
moment in a man's life is at all equal to that in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is being
flattered to the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bent by the love of the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves.
To be flattered by the love of a woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not love is
almost equally unpleasant,--if the man be anything of a man. But at
the present moment our Captain was supremely happy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) Thais was
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was indeed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) king, and should he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) not take the
goods with which the gods provided him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)? To have been robbed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
all by a father, and to have an uncle who would have a headache
instead of making settlements,--these indeed were drawbacks; but the
pleasure was so sweet that even such drawbacks as these could hardly
sully his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) bliss. <div class="bookquote">``If you knew what your letter was to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) leaned against his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) shoulder. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) uncle and all
the Marrables on the earth might do their worst, they could not rob
the present hour of its joy.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVIII.

<p/>THE SQUIRE IS VERY OBSTINATE.


<p/>Mr. Gilmore left his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) own home on a Thursday afternoon, and on the
Monday when the Vicar again visited the Privets nothing had been
heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). Money had been left with the bailiff for the Saturday
wages of the men working about the place, but no provision for
anything had been made beyond that. The Sunday had been wet from
morning to night, and nothing could possibly be more disconsolate
than the aspect of things round the house, or more disreputable if
they were to be left in their present condition. The barrows, and the
planks, and the pickaxes had been taken away, which things, though
they are not in themselves beautiful, are safeguards against the
ill-effects of ugliness, as they inform the eyes why it is that such
disorder lies around. There was the disorder at the Privets now
without any such instruction to the eye. Pits were full of muddy
water, and half-formed paths had become the beds of stagnant pools.
The Vicar then went into the house, and though there was still a
workman and a boy who were listlessly pulling about some rolls of
paper, there were ample signs that misfortune had come and that
neglect was the consequence. <div class="bookquote">``And all this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>said Fenwick to himself,
<div class="bookquote">``because the man cannot get the idea of a certain woman out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
head!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) thought of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own character, and asked
himself whether, in any position of life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) could have been thus
overruled to misery by circumstances altogether outside himself.
Misfortunes might come which would be very heavy; his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) wife or
children might die; or he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) might become a pauper; or subject to some
crushing disease. But Gilmore's trouble had not fallen upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) from
the hands of Providence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) heart upon the gaining of a
thing, and was now absolutely broken-hearted because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could not
have it. And the thing was a woman. Fenwick admitted to himself that
the thing itself was the most worthy for which a man can struggle;
but would not admit that even in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) search for that a man should
allow his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart to give way, or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strength to be broken down.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went up to the house again on the Wednesday, and again on the
Thursday,--but nothing had been heard from the Squire. The bailiff
was very unhappy. Even though there might come a cheque on the
Saturday morning, which both Fenwick and the bailiff thought to be
probable, still there would be grave difficulties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here'll be the first of September on us afore we know where we are,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bailiff</b></font>)</div>said the bailiff, <div class="bookquote">``and is we to go on with the horses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bailiff</b></font>)</div><p/>For the Squire was of all men the most regular, and began to get
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) horses into condition on the first of September as regularly as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) began to shoot partridges. The Vicar went home and then made up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would go up to London after his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) must
provide for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) next Sunday's duty, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could do that out of a
neighbouring parish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would start on the morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) arranged
the matter with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend's curate, and on the
Friday he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) started.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) drove himself into Salisbury instead of to the Bullhampton Road
station in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) might travel by the express train. That at
least was the reason which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) gave to himself and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wife. But
there was present to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) mind the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) might look into the
court and see how the trial was going on. Poor Carry Brattle would
have a bad time of it beneath a lawyer's claws. Such a one as Carry,
of the evil of whose past life there was no doubt, and who would
appear as a witness against a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had once been engaged to
marry, would certainly meet with no mercy from a cross-examining
barrister. The broad landmarks between the respectable and the
disreputable may guide the tone of a lawyer somewhat, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) has a
witness in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) power; but the finer lines which separate that which
is at the moment good and true from that which is false and bad
cannot be discerned amidst the turmoil of a trial, unless the eyes,
and the ears, and the inner touch of him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) who has the handling of the
victim be of a quality more than ordinarily high.

<p/>The Vicar drove himself over to Salisbury and had an hour there for
strolling into the court. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had heard on the previous day that the
case would be brought on the first thing on the Friday, and it was
half-past eleven when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) way in through the crowd. The train
by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was to be taken on to London did not start till half-past
twelve. At that moment the court was occupied in deciding whether
a certain tradesman, living at Devizes, should or should not be on
the jury. The man himself objected that, being a butcher, he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) was, by
reason of the second nature acquired in his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) business, too cruel, and
bloody-minded to be entrusted with an affair of life and death. To a
proposition in itself so reasonable no direct answer was made; but it
was argued with great power on behalf of the crown, which seemed to
think at the time that the whole case depended on getting this one
particular man into the jury box, that the recalcitrant juryman
was not in truth a butcher, that he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) was only a dealer in meat, and
that though the stain of the blood descended the cruelty did not.
Fenwick remained there till he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) heard the case given against the
pseudo-butcher, and then retired from the court. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had, however,
just seen Carry Brattle and her (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) father seated side by side on a bench
in a little outside room appropriated to the witnesses, and there
had been a constable there seeming to stand on guard over them. The
miller was sitting, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) stick, with his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) eyes fixed upon
the ground, and Carry was pale, wretched, and draggled. Sam had not
yet made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afeard, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be in trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said Carry to the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let `un alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller; <div class="bookquote">``when they wants `im he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be here.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know'd more about it nor I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div><p/>That afternoon Fenwick went to the club of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) and Gilmore were
both members, and found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend was in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had been
so, at least, that morning at nine o'clock. According to the porter
at the club door, Mr. Gilmore called there every morning for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
letters as soon as the club was open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) did not eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) breakfast
in the house, nor, as far as the porter's memory went, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) even
enter the club. Fenwick had lodged himself at an hotel in the
immediate neighbourhood of Pall-Mall, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) mind that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) only chance of catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend was to be at the steps of
the club door when it was opened at nine o'clock. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
dinner,--very much in solitude, for on the 28th of August it is not
often that the coffee rooms of clubs are full,--and in the evening
took himself to one of the theatres which was still open. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) club
had been deserted, and it had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) that the streets also
were empty. One old gentleman, who, together with himself, had
employed the forces of the establishment that evening, had told him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
that there wasn't a single soul left in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
tailor's and had found that both the tailor and the foreman were out
of town. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) publisher,--for our Vicar did a little in the way of
light literature on social subjects, and had brought out a pretty
volume in green and gold on the half-profit system, intending to give
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) share to a certain county hospital,--his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) publisher had been in
the north since the 12th, and would not be back for three weeks. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
found, however, a confidential young man who was able to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
that the hospital need not increase the number of its wards on this
occasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had dropped down to Dean's Yard to see a clerical
friend,--but the house was shut up and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not even get an
answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sauntered into the Abbey, and found them mending the
organ. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) got into a cab and was driven hither and thither because
all the streets were pulled up. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) called at the War-Office to
see a young clerk, and found one old messenger fast asleep in
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arm-chair. <div class="bookquote">``Gone for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) holiday, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man in the
arm-chair, speaking amidst his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dreams, without waiting to hear the
particular name of the young clerk who was wanted. And yet, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
got to the theatre, it was so full that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could hardly find a seat
on which to sit. In all the world around us there is nothing more
singular than the emptiness and the fullness of London.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was up early the next morning and breakfasted before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went out,
thinking that even should he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) succeed in catching the Squire, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would
not be able to persuade the unhappy man to come and breakfast with
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). At a little before nine he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was in Pall-Mall, walking up and down
before the club, and as the clocks struck the hour he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) began to be
impatient. The porter had said that Gilmore always came exactly at
nine, and within two minutes after that hour the Vicar began to feel
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend was breaking an engagement and behaving badly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>).
By ten minutes past, the idea had got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) head that all the
people in Pall-Mall were watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), and at the quarter he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was
angry and unhappy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had just counted the seconds up to twenty
minutes, and had begun to consider that it would be absurd for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) to
walk there all the day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) saw the Squire coming slowly along
the street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been afraid to make himself comfortable within the
club, and there to wait for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) friend's coming, lest Gilmore should
have escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>), not choosing to be thus caught by any one;--and
even now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) fear lest his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) quarry should slip through his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
fingers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) waited till the Squire had gone up to the porter and
returned to the street, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) crossed over and seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
by the arm. <div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you didn't expect to see me in
London;--did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the other, implying very plainly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) looks
that the meeting had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) no special pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came up yesterday afternoon, and I was at Cutcote's the tailor's,
and at Messrs. Bringemout and Neversell's. Bringemout has retired,
but it's Neversell that does the business. And then I went down to
see old Drybird, and I called on young Dozey at his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) office. But
everybody is out of town. I never saw anything like it. I vote that
we take to having holidays in the country, and all come to London,
and live in the empty houses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you came up to look after me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore, with a brow
as black as a thunder-cloud.

<p/>Fenwick perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) need not carry on any further his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) lame
pretences. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I did. Come, old fellow, this won't do, you know.
Everything is not to be thrown overboard because a girl doesn't know
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own mind. Aren't your anchors better than that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't an anchor left,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you be so weak and so wicked as to say so? Come, Harry, take
a turn with me in the park. You may be quite sure I shan't let you go
now I've got you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to let me go,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till I've told you my mind. Everybody is out of town, so I
suppose even a parson may light a cigar down here. Harry, you must
come back with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say that you will yield up all your strength, all
your duty, all your life, and throw over every purpose of your
existence because you have been ill-used by a wench? Is that your
idea of manhood,--of that manhood you have so often preached?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After what I have suffered there I cannot bear the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must force yourself to bear it. Do you mean to say that because
you are unhappy you will not pay your debts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I owe no man a shilling;--or, if I do, I will pay it to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are debts you can only settle by daily payments. To every man
living on your land you owe such a debt. To every friend connected
with you by name, or blood, or love, you owe such a debt. Do you
suppose that you can cast yourself adrift, and make yourself a
by-word, and hurt no one but yourself? Why is it that we hate a
suicide?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is a coward, and runs away from the burden which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ought
to bear gallantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) throws his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) load down on the roadside, and does
not care who may bear it, or who may suffer because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is too poor
a creature to struggle on! Have you no feeling that, though it may
be hard with you here,'' (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>--and the Vicar, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) spoke, struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
breast,--<div class="bookquote">``you should so carry your outer self, that the eyes of those
around you should see nothing of the sorrow within? That is my idea
of manliness, and I have ever taken you to be a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We work for the esteem of others while we desire it. I desire
nothing now. She (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has so knocked me about that I should be a liar if

shan't kill myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Harry, you won't do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall give up the place, and go abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all very well to preach, Frank. Bad as I am I could preach to
you if there were a matter to preach about. I don't know that there
is anything much easier than preaching. But as for practising, you

take away his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs. If you break a bird's wing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't fly, let the
bird be ever so full of pluck. All that there was in me she (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has taken
out of me. I could fight him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and would willingly, if I thought there

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I could not stand up and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has left Bullhampton, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not matter, Frank. There is the place that I was getting
ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>). And if I were there, you and your wife would always be
thinking about it. And every fellow about the estate knows the whole
story. It seems to me to be almost inconceivable that a woman should
have done such a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has not meant to act badly, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To tell the truth, when I look back at it all, I blame myself more
than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). A man should never be ass enough to ask any woman a second
time. But I had got it into my head that it was a disgraceful thing
to ask and not to have. It is that which kills me now. I do not think
that I will ever again attempt anything, because failure is so hard
to me to bear. At any rate, I won't go back to the Privets.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
added after a pause, during which the Vicar had been thinking what
new arguments he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could bring up to urge his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend's return.

<p/>Fenwick learned that Gilmore had sent a cheque to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) bailiff by the
post of the preceding night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) acknowledged that in sending the
cheque he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had said no more than to bid the man pay what wages were
due. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not as yet made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind as to any further steps. As
they walked round the enclosure of St. James's Park together, and as
the warmth of their old friendship produced freedom of intercourse,
Gilmore acknowledged a dozen wild schemes that had passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
brain. That to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was most wedded was a plan for meeting Walter
Marrable and cudgelling him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) pretty well to death. Fenwick pointed
out three or four objections to this. In the first place, Marrable
had committed no offence whatever against Gilmore. And then, in all
probability, Marrable might be as good at cudgelling as the Squire
himself. And thirdly, when the cudgelling was over, the man who began
the row would certainly be put into prison, and in atonement for that
would receive no public sympathy. <div class="bookquote">``You can't throw yourself on the
public pity as a woman might,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D-- the public pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Gilmore</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, who was not often driven to
make his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) language forcible after that fashion.

<p/>Another scheme was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would publish the whole transaction. And
here again his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) friend was obliged to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), that a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
position should be reticent rather than outspoken. <div class="bookquote">``You have already
declared,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, <div class="bookquote">``that you can't endure failure, and yet
you want to make your failure known to all the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) third
proposition was more absurd still. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would write such a letter to
Mary Lowther as would cover her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) head with red hot coals. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) had made the world utterly unbearable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) might have the Privets for herself and go and live there. <div class="bookquote">``I
do not doubt but that such a letter would annoy her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I care how much she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is annoyed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so;--but everyone who saw the letter would know that it was
pretence and bombast. Of course you will do nothing of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were together pretty nearly the whole day. Gilmore, no doubt,
would have avoided the Vicar in the morning had it been possible;
but now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been caught, and had been made to undergo
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) friend's lectures, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was rather grateful than otherwise for
something in the shape of society. It was Fenwick's desire to induce
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) to return to Bullhampton. If this could not be done, it would no
doubt be well that some authority should be obtained from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) as to
the management of the place. But this subject had not been mooted
as yet, because Fenwick felt that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) once acknowledged that the
runaway might continue to be a runaway, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) chance of bringing the
man back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own home would be much lessened. As yet, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
had made no impression in that direction. At last they parted on an
understanding that they were to breakfast together the next morning
at Fenwick's hotel, and then go to the eleven o'clock Sunday service
at a certain noted metropolitan church. At breakfast, and during
the walk to church, Fenwick said not a word to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) friend about
Bullhampton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) talked of church services, of ritual, of the
quietness of a Sunday in London, and of the Sunday occupations of
three millions of people not a fourth of whom attend divine service.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) chose any subject other than that of which Gilmore was thinking.
But as soon as they were out of church he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) made another attack upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``After that, Harry, don't you feel like trying to do your duty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel that I can't fly because my wing is broken,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.

<p/>They spent the whole of the afternoon and evening together, but no
good was done. Gilmore, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) had a plan, intended to go
abroad, travel to the East, or to the West,--or to the South, if so
it came about. The Privets might be let if any would choose to take
the place. As far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) was concerned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) income from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) tenants
would be more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wanted. <div class="bookquote">``As for doing them any good, I never
did them any good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) parted from the Vicar for the
night. <div class="bookquote">``If they can't live on the land without my being at home, I am
sure they won't if I stay there.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXIX.

<p/>THE TRIAL.


<p/>The miller, as he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was starting from his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) house door, had called
his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) daughter by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own name for the first time since her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) return
home,--and Carry had been comforted. But no further comfort came
to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) during her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) journey to Salisbury from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father's speech.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hardly spoke the whole morning, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did say a word as
to any matter on the work they had in hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice was low and
melancholy. Carry knew well, as did every one at Bullhampton, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father was a man not much given to conversation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had not
expected him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); but the silence, together with the load
at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heart as to the ordeal of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) examination, was very heavy on
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could have asked questions, and received encouragement,
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could have borne her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) position comparatively with ease.

<p/>The instructions with which the miller was furnished required that
Carry Brattle should present herself at a certain office in Salisbury
at a certain hour on that Wednesday. Exactly at that hour she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father were at the place indicated, already having visited their
lodgings at Mrs. Stiggs'. They were then told that they would not be
again wanted on that day, but that they must infallibly be in the
Court the next morning at half-past nine. The attorney's clerk whom
they saw, when he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) learned that Sam Brattle was not yet in Salisbury,
expressed an opinion as to that young man's iniquity which led Carry
to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was certainly in more danger than either of the
prisoners. As they left the office, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) father that
a message should be immediately sent to Bullhampton after Sam. <div class="bookquote">``Let
`un be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller; and it was all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) did say. On that
evening they retired to the interior of one of the bedrooms at
Trotter's Buildings, at four o'clock in the afternoon, and did not
leave the house again. Anything more dreary than those hours could
not be imagined. The miller, who was accustomed to work hard all
day and then to rest, did not know what to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) limbs.
Carry, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) misery, and thinking rather of that than her (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) own,
suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) that they should go out and walk round the town.
<div class="bookquote">``Bide as thee be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller; <div class="bookquote">``it ain't no time now for showing
theeself.''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>Carry took the rebuke without a word, but turned her (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) head
to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) tears.

<p/>And the next day was worse, because it was longer. Exactly at
half-past nine they were down at the court; and there they hung about
till half-past ten. Then they were told that their affair would not
be brought on till the Friday, but that at half-past nine on that
day, it would undoubtedly be commenced; and that if Sam was not there
then, it would go very hard with Sam. The miller, who was beginning
to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) respect for the young man from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) received these
communications, muttered something about Sam being all right. <div class="bookquote">``You'll
find he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) won't be all right if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) isn't here at half-past nine
to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">``There is them as their bark is worse
than their bite,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller. Then they went back to Trotter's
Buildings, and did not stir outside of Mrs. Stiggs' house throughout
the whole day.

<p/>On the Friday, which was in truth to be the day of the trial, they
were again in court at half-past nine; and there, as we have seen,
they were found, two hours later, by Mr. Fenwick, waiting patiently
while the great preliminary affair of the dealer in meat was being
settled. At that hour Sam had not made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) appearance; but between
twelve and one he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sauntered into the comfortless room in which Carry
was still sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) father. The sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a joy to poor
Carry, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>), and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Stiggs</b></font>) something of what was
going on. <div class="bookquote">``I'm about in time for the play, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, coming
up to them. The miller picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) hat, and scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) head, and
muttered something. But there had been a sparkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) eye when he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>)
saw Sam. In truth, the sight in all the world most agreeable to the
old man's eyes was the figure of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youngest son. To the miller no
Apollo could have been more perfect in beauty, and no Hercules more
useful in strength. Carry's sweet woman's brightness had once been as
dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>),--but all that had now passed away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a`going all through?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>asked the miller, referring to the mill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Running as pretty as a coach-and-four when I left at seven this
morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Sam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how did thee come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the marrow-bone stage, as don't pay no tolls; how else?''  (<font color='red'><b>The miller</b></font>)</div>The
miller did not express a single word of approbation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) looked
up and down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) son's legs and limbs, delighted to think that
the young man was at work in the mill this morning, had since that
walked seventeen miles, and now stood before them showing no sign of
fatigue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are they a`doing on now, Sam?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Carry, in a whisper. Sam
had already been into the court, and was able to inform them that
the <div class="bookquote">``big swell of all was making a speech, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was telling
everybody every `varsal thing about it. And what do you think,
father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They've been and found Trumbull's money-box buried in old mother
Burrows's garden at Pycroft.''  (<font color='red'><b>the scream</b></font>)</div>Carry uttered the slightest possible
scream as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard this, thinking of the place which she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had known
so well. <div class="bookquote">``Dash my buttons if they ain't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>continued Sam. <div class="bookquote">``It's about
up with 'em now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll be hung--of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What asses men is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Sam; <div class="bookquote">''--to go to bury the box there! Why
didn't they smash it into atoms?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Them as goes crooked in big things is like to go crooked in little,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller.

<p/>At about two Sam and Carry were told to go into Court, and way
was made for the old man to accompany them. At that moment the
cross-examination was being continued of the man who, early on the
Sunday morning, had seen the Grinder with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion in the cart
on the road leading towards Pycroft Common. A big burly barrister,
with a broad forehead and grey eyes, was questioning this witness as
to the identity of the men in the cart; and at every answer that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
received he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) turned round to the jury as though he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) would say <div class="bookquote">``There,
then, what do you think of the case now, when such a man as that is
brought before you to give evidence?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will swear, then, that
these two men who are here in the dock were the two men you saw that
morning in that cart?''  (<font color='red'><b>The witness</b></font>)</div>The witness said that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) would so swear. <div class="bookquote">``You
knew them both before, of course?''  (<font color='red'><b>The witness</b></font>)</div>The witness declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had
never seen either of them before in his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) life. <div class="bookquote">``And you expect the
jury to believe, now that the lives of these men depend on their
believing it, that after the lapse of a year you can identify these
two men, whom you had never seen before, and who were at that time
being carried along the road at the rate of eight or ten miles an
hour?''  (<font color='red'><b>The witness</b></font>)</div>The witness, who had already encountered a good many of these
questions, and who was inclined to be rough rather than timid, said
that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) didn't care twopence what the jury believed. It was simply
his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) business to tell what he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) knew. Then the judge looked at that
wicked witness,--who had talked in this wretched, jeering way about
twopence!--looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) over his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) spectacles, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) head as
though with pity at that witness's wickedness, cautioned him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) as to
the peril of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) body, making, too, a marked reference to the peril
of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) soul by that melancholy wagging of the head. Then the burly
barrister with the broad forehead looked up beseechingly to the jury.
Was it right that any man should be hung for any offence against whom
such a witness as this was brought up to give testimony? It was the
manifest feeling of the crowd in the court that the witness himself
ought to be hung immediately. <div class="bookquote">``You may go down, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div>said the burly
barrister, giving an impression to those who looked on, but did not
understand, that the case was over as far as it depended on that
man's evidence. The burly barrister himself was not so sanguine.
He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) knew very well that the judge who had wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) head in so
melancholy a way at the iniquity of a witness who had dared to
say that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) didn't care twopence, would, when he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was summing up,
refer to the presence of the two prisoners in the cart as a thing
fairly supported by evidence. The amount of the burly barrister's
achievement was simply this,--that for the moment a sort of sympathy
was excited on behalf of the prisoners by the disapprobation which
was aroused against the wicked man who hadn't cared twopence.
Sympathy, like electricity, will run so quick that no man may stop
it. If sympathy might be made to run through the jury-box there might
perchance be a man or two there weak enough to entertain it to the
prejudice of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty on that day. The hopes of the burly barrister
in this matter did not go further than that.

<p/>Then there was another man put forward who had seen neither of the
prisoners, but had seen the cart and pony at Pycroft Common, and had
known that the cart and pony were for the time in the possession of
the Grinder. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was questioned by the burly barrister about himself
rather than about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evidence; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been made to own that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been five times in prison, the burly barrister was almost
justified in the look he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) gave to the jury, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) head as
though in sorrow that his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) learned friend on the other side should
have dared to bring such a man as that before them as a witness.

<p/>Various others were brought up and examined before poor Carry's turn
had come; and on each occasion, as one after another was dismissed
from the hands of the burly barrister, here one crushed and
confounded, there another loud and triumphant, her (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) heart was almost
in her (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) throat. And yet though she (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) so dreaded the moment when it
should come, there was a sense of wretched disappointment in that
she (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was kept waiting. It was now between four and five, and whispers
began to be rife that the Crown would not finish their case that day.
There was much trouble and more amusement with the old woman who
had been Trumbull's housekeeper. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was very deaf; but it had been
discovered that there was an old friendship between her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) and the
Grinder's mother, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) had at one time whispered the fact of
the farmer's money into the ears of Mrs. Burrows of Pycroft Common.
Deaf as she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) was made to admit this. Mrs. Burrows was also
examined, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) would admit nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) had never heard of the
money, or of Farmer Trumbull, or of the murder,--not till the world
heard of it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) knew nothing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) son's doings or comings
or goings. No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) had given shelter to a young woman at the
request of a friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) son, the young woman paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) ten
shillings a week for her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) board and lodging. That young woman was
Carry Brattle. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son and that young man had certainly been at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
house together; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not at all say whether they had been
there on that Sunday morning. Perhaps, of all who had been examined
Mrs. Burrows was the most capable witness, for the lawyer who
examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) on behalf of the Crown was able to extract absolutely
nothing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) turned herself round with an air of
satisfaction, to face the questions of the burly barrister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) was
told that he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had no question to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's all as one to me,
sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Burrows/Burrows</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Burrows, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>) apron and went down.

<p/>And then it was poor Carry's turn. When the name of Caroline Brattle
was called she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) eyes beseechingly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) father, as though
hoping that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) in this the dreaded moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
punishment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) caught him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) convulsively by the sleeve of the coat, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was partly dragged and partly shoved on towards the little box
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) stand. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) to the foot
of the two or three steps which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was called on to ascend, but of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could go no further with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll bide nigh thee, Carry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said; and it was the only word which
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had spoken to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) that day. It did, however, serve to
lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) present misery, and added something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) poor stock of
courage. <div class="bookquote">``Your name is Caroline Brattle?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you were living on the
thirty-first of last August with Mrs. Burrows at Pycroft Common?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do
you remember Sunday the thirty-first of August?''  (<font color='red'><b>a barrister</b></font>)</div>These, and two or
three other questions like them were asked by a young barrister in
the mildest tone he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) could assume. <div class="bookquote">``Speak out, Miss Brattle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``and then there will be nothing to trouble you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
said, in answer to each of the questions, still almost in a whisper.

<p/>Nothing to trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), and all the eyes of that cruel world around
fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)! Nothing to trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), and every ear on the alert
to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>),--young and pretty as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was,--confess her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) own shame
in that public court! Nothing to trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) would so
willingly have died to escape the agony that was coming on her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)! For
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) knew that it would come. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had never been in a court of
law before, and had had no one tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) what would happen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) knew
that the question would be asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) would be made
to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been before all that crowd of men.

<p/>The evidence which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could give, though it was material, was very
short. John Burrows and Lawrence Acorn had come to the cottage on
Pycroft Common on that Sunday morning, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had seen both
of them. It was daylight when they came, but still it was very early.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had not observed the clock, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) thought that it may have
been about five. The men were in and out of the house, but they had
some breakfast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had risen from bed to help to get them their
breakfast. If anything had been buried by them in the garden, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
had known nothing of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had then received three sovereigns from
Acorn, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was engaged to marry. From that day to the present
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had never seen either of the men. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) heard of the
suspicion against Acorn, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) had fled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) conceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
engagement to be at an end. All this she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) testified, with infinite
difficulty, in so low a voice that a man was sworn to stand by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
and repeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) answers aloud to the jury;--and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was handed
over to the burly barrister.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been long enough in the court to perceive, and had been
clever enough to learn, that this man would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) enemy. Though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had been unable to speak aloud in answering the counsel for
the prosecution, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) had quite understood that the man was her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
friend,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was only putting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) those questions which
must be asked,--and questions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could answer without much
difficulty. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) was told to attend to what the other
gentleman would say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), then, indeed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) poor heart failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>).

<p/>It came at once. <div class="bookquote">``My dear, I believe you have been indiscreet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The words, perhaps, had been chosen with some idea of mercy, but
certainly there was no mercy in the tone. The man's voice was loud,
and there was something in it almost of a jeer,--something which
seemed to leave an impression on the hearer that there had been
pleasure in the asking it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) struggled to make an answer, and the
monosyllable, yes, was formed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) lips. The man who was acting as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) mouthpiece stooped down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) lips, and then shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
head. Assuredly no sound had come from them that could have reached
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sense, had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been ever so close. The burly barrister waited in
patience, looking now at her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>), and now round at the court. <div class="bookquote">``I must
have an answer. I say that I believe you have been indiscreet. You
know, I dare say, what I mean. Yes or no will do; but I must have
an answer.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) glanced round for an instant, trying to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>)
father's eye; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) could see nothing; everything seemed to swim
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Brattle</b></font>) except the broad face of that burly barrister. <div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Burrows</b></font>)
given any answer?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) asked of the mouthpiece; and the mouthpiece
again shook his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) head. The heart of the mouthpiece was tender, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>)
was beginning to hate the burly barrister. <div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div>said the burly
barrister, <div class="bookquote">``the jury must have the information from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div><p/>Then gradually there was heard through the court the gurgling sounds
of irrepressible sobs,--and with them there came a moan from the old
man, who was only divided from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter by the few steps,--which
was understood by the whole crowd. The story of the poor girl, in
reference to the trial, had been so noised about that it was known
to all the listeners. That spark of sympathy, of which we have said
that its course cannot be arrested when it once finds its way into
a crowd, had been created, and there was hardly present then one,
either man or woman, who would not have prayed that Carry Brattle
might be spared if it were possible. There was a juryman there, a
father with many daughters, who thought that it might not misbecome
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to put forward such a prayer himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it mayn't be necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>the juryman</b></font>)</div>said the soft-hearted juryman.

<p/>But the burly barrister was not a man who liked to be taught his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) duty
by any one in court,--not even by a juryman,--and his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) quick intellect
immediately told him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) must seize the spark of sympathy in
its flight. It could not be stopped, but it might be turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>)
own purpose. It would not suffice for him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) now that he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) should simply
defend the question he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had asked. The court was showing its aptitude
for pathos, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) also must be pathetic on his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) own side. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) knew
well enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) could not arrest public opinion which was going
against him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>), by shewing that his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) question was a proper question; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) might do so by proving at once how tender was his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) own heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pain and grief to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to bring sorrow upon
any one. But look at those prisoners at the bar, whose lives are
committed to my charge, and know that I, as their advocate, love them
while they are my clients as well as any father can love his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child. I
will spend myself for them, even though it may be at the risk of the
harsh judgment of those around me. It is my duty to prove to the jury
on their behalf that the life of this young woman has been such as
to invalidate her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) testimony against them;--and that duty I shall do,
fearless of the remarks of any one. Now I ask you again, Caroline
Brattle, whether you are not one of the unfortunates?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This attempt of the burly barrister was to a certain extent
successful. The juryman who had daughters of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) own had been put
down, and the barrister had given, at any rate, an answer to the
attack that had been silently made on him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) by the feeling of the
court. Let a man be ready with a reply, be it ever so bad a reply,
and any attack is parried. But Carry had given no answer to the
question, and those who looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>) thought it very improbable that
she (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>) would be able to do so. She (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>) had clutched the arm of the man who
stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>), and in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>) sobs was looking round with
snatched, quick, half-completed glances for protection to the spot on
which her (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>) father and brother were standing. The old man had moaned
once; but after that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uttered no sound. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stick with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the ground, quite motionless. Sam was
standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) hands grasping the woodwork before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) bold
gaze fastened on the barrister's face, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) were about to fly
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). The burly barrister saw it all and perceived that more was to
be gained by sparing than by persecuting his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) witness, and resolved to
let her (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>) go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Your silence tells all that I
wish the jury to know. You may go down.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Then the man who had acted
as mouthpiece led Carry away, delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>) up to her (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>) father, and
guided them both out of court.

<p/>They went back to the room in which they had before been seated, and
there they waited for Sam, who was called into the witness-box as
they left the court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Carry, as soon as the old man was again placed
upon the bench. And she (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>) stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and put her (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've won through it, girl, and let that be enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the
miller. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>juryman</b></font>) sat down close by his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) side, and not another word was
spoken by them till Sam returned.

<p/>Sam's evidence was, in fact, but of little use. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had had dealings
with Acorn, who had introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) to Burrows, and had known the two
men at the old woman's cottage on the Common. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was asked, what
these dealings had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said they were honest dealings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About your sister's marriage?''  (<font color='red'><b>the crown lawyer</b></font>)</div>suggested the crown lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,--yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam/Sam Brattle/Brattle</b></font>)</div>said Sam. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) stated that the men had come over
to Bullhampton and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had accompanied them as they walked round
Farmer Trumbull's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) had taken them into the Vicar's garden;
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) gave an account of the meeting there with Mr. Fenwick.
After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had known and seen nothing of the men. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
testified so far he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was handed over to the burly barrister.

<p/>The burly barrister tried all he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) knew, but he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) could make nothing of
this witness. A question was asked him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>), the true answer to which
would have implied that his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) sister's life had been disreputable. When
this was asked Sam declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would not say a word about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
sister one way or the other. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sister had told them all she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knew
about the murder, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had told them all he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) protested
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was willing to answer any questions they might ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) about
himself; but about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sister he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would answer none. When told that
the information desired might be got in a more injurious way from
other sources, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) became rather impudent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you may go to--other sources,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was threatened with all manner of pains and penalties; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) made
nothing of these threats, and was at last allowed to leave the box.
When his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) evidence was completed the trial was adjourned for another
day.

<p/>Though it was then late in the afternoon the three Brattles returned
home that night. There was a train which took them to the Bullhampton
Road station, and from thence they walked to the mill. It was a weary
journey both for the poor girl and for the old man; but anything was
better than delay for another night in Trotter's Buildings. And then
the miller was unwilling to be absent from his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) mill one hour longer
than was necessary. When there came to be a question whether he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) could
walk, he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) laughed the difficulty to scorn in his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) quiet way. <div class="bookquote">``Why
shouldn't I walk it? Ain't I got to `arn my bread every day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brattle/George/George Brattle</b></font>)</div><p/>It was ten o'clock when they reached the mill, and Mrs. Brattle, not
expecting them at that hour, was in bed. But Fanny was up, and did
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could to comfort them. But no one could ever comfort old
Brattle. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) was not susceptible to soft influences. It may almost
be said that he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) condemned himself because he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) gave way to the daily
luxury of a pipe. He (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) believed in plenty of food, because food for the
workman is as coals to the steam-engine, as oats to the horse,--the
raw material out of which the motive power of labour must be made.
Beyond eating and working a man had little to do, but just to wait
till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died. That was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) theory of life in these his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) latter days;
and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man with keen feelings and a loving heart.

<p/>But Carry was comforted when her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister's arms were around her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``They
asked me if I was bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I thought I should a' died,
and I never answered them a word,--and at last they let me go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When Fanny inquired whether their father had been kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been <div class="bookquote">``main kind.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But, oh, Fanny! if he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'d only
say a word, it would warm one's heart; wouldn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence Acorn</b></font>)</div><p/>On the following evening news reached Bullhampton that the Grinder
had been convicted and sentenced to death, but that Lawrence Acorn
had been acquitted. The judge, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) summing up, had shown that
certain evidence which applied to the Grinder had not applied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>)
comrade in the dock, and the jury had been willing to take any excuse
for saving one man from the halter.




<p/>CHAPTER LXX.

<p/>THE FATE OF THE PUDDLEHAMITES.


<p/>Fenwick and Gilmore breakfasted together on the morning that the
former left London for Bullhampton; and by that time the Vicar had
assured himself that it would be quite impossible to induce his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
friend to go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) home. <div class="bookquote">``I shall turn up after some years if
I live,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire; <div class="bookquote">``and I suppose I shan't think so much about
it then; but for the present I will not go to the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) authorised Fenwick to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) pleased about the house and
the gardens, and promised to give instructions as to the sale of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) horses. If the whole place were not let, the bailiff might, he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>)
suggested, carry on the farm himself. When he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) was urged as to his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>)
duty, he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) again answered by his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) illustration of the man without a leg.
<div class="bookquote">``It may be all very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that a man ought to walk, but if
you cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't walk.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Fenwick at last found that there
was nothing more to be said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was constrained to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that you forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>the Vicar asked, as they were
walking together up and down the station in the Waterloo Road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will not care a brass farthing for my forgiveness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div>said
Gilmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wrong her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) there. I am sure that nothing would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so much
comfort as such a message.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gilmore/Gilmore/MR. GILMORE</b></font>)</div><p/>Gilmore walked half the length of the platform before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) replied.
<div class="bookquote">``What is the good of telling a lie about it?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) said, at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly would not tell a lie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I can't say that I forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). How is a man to forgive such
treatment? If I said that I did, you wouldn't believe me. I will keep
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) way, and that will be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) than forgiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some of your wrath, I fear, falls to my lot?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Frank. You and your wife have done the best for me all
through,--as far as you thought was best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have meant to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has been false to me as no woman was ever false before,
that is not your fault. As for the jewels, tell your wife to lock
them up,--or to throw them away if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) likes that better. My
brother's wife will have them some day, I suppose.''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>Now his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) brother
was in India, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) brother's wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had never seen. Then there
was a pledge given that Gilmore would inform his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) friend by letter of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) future destination, and so they parted.

<p/>This was on the Tuesday, and Fenwick had desired that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) gig might
meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) at the Bullhampton Road station. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) had learned by this time
of the condemnation of one man for the murder, and the acquittal of
the other, and was full of the subject when his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) groom was seated
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>). Had the Brattles come back to the mill? And what of
Sam? And what did the people say about Acorn's escape? These, and
many other questions he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) asked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) servant was
so burdened with a matter of separate and of infinitely greater
interest, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) could not be got to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) mind to the late
trial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) believed the Brattles were back; he (<font color='blue'><b>Acorn</b></font>) had seen nothing of
Sam; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) didn't know anything about Acorn; but the new chapel was
going to be pulled down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Vicar;--<div class="bookquote">``not at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So they was saying, sir, when I come away. And the men was at
it,--that is, standing all about. And there is to be no more
preaching, sir. And missus was out in the front looking at 'em as I
drove out of the yard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Fenwick asked twenty questions, but could obtain no other information
than was given in the first announcement of these astounding news.
And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) entered the vicarage he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was still asking questions, and the
man was still endeavouring to express his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own conviction that that
horrible, damnable, and most heart-breaking red brick building would
be demolished, and carted clean away before the end of the week.
For the servants and dependents of the vicarage were staunch to the
interests of the church establishment, with a degree of fervour
of which the Vicar himself knew nothing. They hated Puddleham and
dissent. This groom would have liked nothing better than a commission
to punch the head of Mr. Puddleham's eldest son, a young man who had
been employed in a banker's office at Warminster, but had lately come
home because he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had been found to have a taste for late hours and
public-house parlours; and had made himself busy on the question of
the chapel. The maid servants at the vicarage looked down as from a
mighty great height on the young women of Bullhampton who attended
the chapel, and the vicarage gardener, since he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) had found out that
the chapel stood on glebe land, and ought therefore, to be placed
under his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) hands, had hardly been able to keep himself off the ground.
His (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) proposed cure for the evil that had been done,--as an immediate
remedy before erection and demolition could be carried out, was to
form the vicarage manure pit close against the chapel door,--<div class="bookquote">``and
then let anybody touch our property who dares!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) had, however, been
too cautious to carry out any such strategy as this, without direct
authority from the Commander-in-Chief. <div class="bookquote">``Master thinks a deal too much
on 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Commander-in-Chief</b></font>) had said to the groom, almost in disgust at the Vicar's
pusillanimity.

<p/>When Fenwick reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) own gate there was a crowd of men loitering
around the chapel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) got out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) gig and joined them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
eye first fell upon Mr. Puddleham, who was standing directly in front
of the door, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) back to the building, wearing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) face
an expression of infinite displeasure. The Vicar was desirous of
assuring the minister that no steps need be taken, at any rate,
for the present, towards removing the chapel from its present
situation. But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could speak to Mr. Puddleham he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) perceived
the builder from Salisbury, who appeared to be very busy,--Grimes,
the Bullhampton tradesman, so lately discomfited, but now
triumphant,--Bolt, the elder, close at Mr. Puddleham's elbow,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
own churchwarden, with one or two other farmers,--and lastly, Lord
St. George himself, walking in company with Mr. Packer, the agent.
Many others from the village were there, so that there was quite
a public meeting on the bit of ground which had been appropriated
to Mr. Puddleham's preachings. Fenwick, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) saw Lord St.
George, accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) spoke to the others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend Mr. Puddleham,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``seems to have the benefit of a
distinguished congregation this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The last, I fear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) will ever have on this spot,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>said the lord, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) shook hands with the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry to hear you say so, my lord. Of course, I don't know
what you are doing, and I can't make Mr. Puddleham preach here, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
be not willing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Puddleham had now joined them. <div class="bookquote">``I am ready and willing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``to do my duty in that sphere of life to which it has pleased God to
call me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) thought that the sphere to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) had been called was that special chapel opposite to the vicarage
entrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I was saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>continued the Vicar, <div class="bookquote">``I have neither the wish nor
the power to control my neighbour; but, as far as I am concerned, no
step need be taken to displace him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). I did not like this site for the
chapel at first; but I have got quit of all that feeling, and Mr.
Puddleham may preach to his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) heart's content,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) will, no doubt,
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) hearers' welfare, and will not annoy me in the least.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>On
hearing this, Mr. Puddleham pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) hat off his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) forehead and
looked up and frowned, as though the levity of expression in which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) rival indulged, was altogether unbecoming the solemnity of the
occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>said the lord, <div class="bookquote">``we have taken advice, and we find the
thing ought to be done,--and to be done instantly. The leading men of
the congregation are quite of that view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are of course unwilling to oppose your noble father, my lord,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>said the minister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to tell you the truth, Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord St. George/St. George</b></font>)</div>continued Lord St. George,
<div class="bookquote">``you might be put, most unjustly, into a peck of troubles if we did
not do this. You have no right to let the glebe on a building lease,
even if you were willing, and high ecclesiastical authority would
call upon you at once to have the nuisance removed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord St. George/St. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nuisance, my lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Puddleham/MR. PUDDLEHAM/Puddleham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Puddleham, who had seen with half an
eye that the son was by no means worthy of the father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes,--placed in the middle of the Vicar's ground! What would
you say if Mr. Fenwick demanded leave to use your parlour for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
vestry room, and to lock up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) surplice in your cupboard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'d try it on before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'d had it a day,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar,
<div class="bookquote">``and very well he (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)'d look in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>whereupon the minister again raised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) hat, and again frowned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The long and the short of it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>continued the lord, <div class="bookquote">``that we've,
among us, made a most absurd mistake, and the sooner we put it right
the better. My father, feeling that our mistake has led to all the
others, and that we have caused all this confusion, thinks it to be
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) duty to pull the chapel down and build it up on the site before
proposed near the cross roads. We'll begin at once, and hope to get
it done by Christmas. In the mean time, Mr. Puddleham has consented
to go back to the old chapel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) stay here till the other is finished?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>asked the
Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>replied the lord, <div class="bookquote">``we are going to transfer the chapel
body and bones. If we were Yankees we should know how to do it
without pulling it in pieces. As it is, we've got to do it piecemeal.
So now, Mr. Hickbody,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) continued, turning round to the builder
from Salisbury, <div class="bookquote">``you may go to work at once. The Marquis will be much
obliged to you if you will press it on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Salisbury/Salisbury Baptist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hickbody</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hickbody, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hickbody</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``We'll
put on quite a body of men, my lord, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship's commands
shall be obeyed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div><p/>After which Lord St. George and Mr. Fenwick withdrew together from
the chapel and walked into the vicarage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If all that be absolutely necessary--''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>began the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, Mr. Fenwick; we've made a mistake.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>Lord St. George always
spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) father as <div class="bookquote">``we,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>when there came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) the necessity
of retrieving his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) father's errors. <div class="bookquote">``And our only way out of it is
to take the bull by the horns at once and put the thing right. It
will cost us about L700, and then there is the bore of having to own
ourselves to be wrong. But that is much better than a fight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have fought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have been driven to fight. And then there is the one
absolute fact;--the chapel ought not to be there. And now I've one
other word to say. Don't you think this quarrelling between clergyman
and landlord is bad for the parish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very bad indeed, Lord St. George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I'm not going to measure out censure, or to say that we have
been wrong, or that you have been wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you do I shall defend myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so. But if bygones can be bygones there need be neither
offence nor defence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can a clergyman think, Lord St. George, when the landlord of
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) parish writes letters against him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bishop, maligning his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
private character, and spreading reports for which there is not the
slightest foundation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fenwick, is that the way in which you let bygones be bygones?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very hard to say that I can forget such an injury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father, at any rate, is willing to forget,--and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hopes,
to forgive. In all disputes each party of course thinks that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has
been right. If you, for the sake of the parish, and for the sake of
Christian charity and goodwill, are ready to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) half way, all
this ill-will may be buried in the ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>What could the Vicar do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was being cunningly cheated
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) grievance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would have had not a minute's hesitation as
to forgiving the Marquis, had the Marquis owned himself to be wrong.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was now invited to bury the hatchet on even terms, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) knew
that the terms should not be even. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) resented all this the more
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) heart because he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) understood very well how clever and cunning
was the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) enemy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did not like to be cheated out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
forgiveness. But after all, what did it matter? Would it not be
enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) to know, himself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had been right? Was it
not much to feel himself free from all pricks of conscience in the
matter?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Lord Trowbridge is willing to let it all pass,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``so am
I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Lord St. George, with spirit; <div class="bookquote">``I will not come
in now, because I have already overstayed my time, but I hope you may
hear from my father before long in a spirit of kindness.''

<p/>THE END OF MARY LOWTHER``S STORY.


<p/>Sir Gregory Marrable's headache was not of long duration. Allusion
is here made to that especial headache under the acute effects of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had taken so very unpromising a farewell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) nephew and
heir. It lasted, however, for two or three days, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had
frequent consultations with Mrs. Brownlow, and had one conversation
with Edith. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) was disappointed, sorry, and sore at heart because the
desire on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) mind could not be fulfilled; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
was too weak to cling either to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) hope or to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) anger. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) own son
had gone from him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>), and this young man must be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heir and the owner
of Dunripple. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might punish the young man by excluding
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from any share of ownership for the present; but there would be
neither comfort nor advantage in that. It is true that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might save
any money that Walter would cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), and give it to Edith,--but such
a scheme of saving for such a purpose was contrary to the old man's
nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heir near him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at Dunripple. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated
the feeling of desolation which was presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the idea of
Dunripple without some young male Marrable at hand to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
desired, unconsciously, to fill up the void made by the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
son with as little trouble as might be. And therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) consulted
Mrs. Brownlow.

<p/>Mrs. Brownlow was clearly of opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) had better take his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
nephew, with the encumbrance of Mary Lowther, and make them both
welcome to the house. <div class="bookquote">``We have all heard so much good of Miss
Lowther, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is not at all the
same as a stranger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregory/Gregory Marrable/GREGORY MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Sir Gregory, willing to be talked over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then, you know, who can say whether Edith would ever have liked
him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) or not. You never can tell what way a young woman's feelings will
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gregory/Gregory Marrable/GREGORY MARRABLE</b></font>)</div><p/>On hearing this Sir Gregory uttered some sound intended to express
mildly a divergence of opinion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) did not doubt but what Edith would
have been quite willing to fall in love with Walter, had all things
been conformable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) doing so. Mrs. Brownlow did not notice this
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) continued,--<div class="bookquote">``At any rate the poor girl would suffer dreadfully
now if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were allowed to think that you should be divided from
your nephew by your regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could hardly stay at
Dunripple if that were so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Brownlow in a mild way suggested that nothing should be said to
Edith, and Sir Gregory gave half a promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) would be silent.
But it was against his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) nature not to speak. When the moment came the
temptation to say something that could be easily said, and which
would produce some mild excitement, was always too strong for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) said, one evening, when Edith was hovering round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>)
chair, <div class="bookquote">``you remember what I once said to you about your cousin
Walter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edith/Edith Brownlow/EDITH BROWNLOW</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Captain Marrable, uncle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is just the same as a cousin;--it turns out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) is
engaged to marry another cousin,--Mary Lowther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) real cousin, Uncle Gregory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw the young lady,--that I know of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor have I,--but I've heard so much about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)! And everybody says
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is nice. I hope they'll come and live here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know yet, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) told me all about it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) was going to be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, uncle, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) did not tell me that exactly;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said
that--that--. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) told me how much he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) loved Mary Lowther, and a great
deal about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>), and I felt sure it would come so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are aware that what I had hinted about you and Walter--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk about that, Uncle Gregory. I knew that it was ever so
unlikely, and I didn't think about it. You are so good to me that of
course I couldn't say anything. But you may be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) is ever so
much in love with Miss Lowther; and I do hope we shall be so fond of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gregory/Gregory Marrable/GREGORY MARRABLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Gregory was pacified and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) headache for the time was cured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>)
had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) little scheme, and it had failed. Edith was very good,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) should still be his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) pet and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) favourite,--but Walter
Marrable should be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) might marry and bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) bride to
Dunripple, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) would sell out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) regiment, the family
lawyer should be instructed to make such arrangements for him (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) as
would have been made had he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) actually been a son. There would be some
little difficulty about the colonel's rights; but the colonel had
already seized upon so much that it could not but be easy to deal
with him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>). On the next morning the letter was written to Walter by
Mrs. Brownlow herself.

<p/>About a week after this Mary Lowther, who was waiting at Loring with
an outward show of patience, but with much inward anxiety for further
tidings from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) lover, received two letters, one from Walter, and
the other from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) friend, Janet Fenwick. The reader shall see those,
and the replies which Mary made to them, and then our whole story
will have been told as far as the loves, and hopes, and cares, and
troubles of Mary Lowther are concerned.


<p/>Bullhampton, 1st September.

<p/>DEAREST MARY,

<p/>I write a line just because I said I would. Frank went
up to London last week and was away one Sunday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) found
his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) poor friend in town and was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) for two or three
days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) mind to let the Privets, and go
abroad, and nothing that Frank could say would move him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>).
I do not know whether it may not be for the best. We shall
lose such a neighbour as we never shall have again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
was the same as a brother to both of us; and I can only
say, that loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) like a brother, I endeavoured to
do the best for him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) that I could. This I do know;--that
nothing on earth shall ever tempt me to set my hand at
match-making again. But it was alluring,--the idea of
bringing my two dearest friends near me together.

<p/>If you have anything to tell me of your happiness, I shall
be delighted to hear it; I will not set my heart against
this other man;--but you can hardly expect me to say that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be as much to me as might have been that other.
God bless you,

<p/>Your most affectionate friend,

<p/>JANET FENWICK.

<p/>I must tell you the fate of the chapel. They are already
pulling it down, and carting away the things to the other
place. They are doing it so quick, that it will all be
gone before we know where we are. I own I am glad. As
for Frank, I really believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)'d rather let it remain.
But this is not all. The Marquis has promised that we
shall hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``in a spirit of kindness.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I wonder
what this will come to? It certainly was not a spirit of
kindness that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) write to the bishop and call Frank
an infidel.


<p/>And this was the other letter.


<p/>Barracks, 1st September, 186--.

<p/>DEAREST LOVE,

<p/>I hope this will be one of the last letters I shall write
from this abominable place, for I am going to sell out at
once. It is all settled, and I'm to be a sort of deputy
Squire at Dunripple, under my uncle. As that is to be my
fate in life, I may as well begin it at once. But that's
not the whole of my fate, nor the best of it. You are to
be admitted as deputy Squiress,--or rather as Squiress
in chief, seeing that you will be mistress of the house.
Dearest Mary, may I hope that you won't object to the
promotion?

<p/>I have had a long letter from Mrs. Brownlow; and I ran
over yesterday and saw my uncle. I was so hurried that
I could not write from Dunripple. I would send you Mrs.
Brownlow's letter, only perhaps it would not be quite
fair. I dare say you will see it some day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) says ever
so much about you, and as complimentary as possible.
And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) declares her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) purpose to resign all rights,
honours, pains, privileges, and duties of mistress
of Dunripple into your hands as soon as you are Mrs.
Marrable. And this she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) repeated yesterday with some
stateliness, and a great deal of high-minded resignation.
But I don't mean to laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), because I know she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) means
to do what is right.

<p/>My own, own, Mary, write me a line instantly to say that
it is right,--and to say also that you agree with me that
as it is to be done, `twere well it were done quickly.

<p/>Yours always, with all my heart,

<p/>W. M.


<p/>It was of course necessary that Mary should consult with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered the second letter. Of that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) received
from Mrs. Fenwick she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) determined to say nothing. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ever
mention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt again a name so painful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as that of Mr.
Gilmore? The thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) could not be avoided. In this, the great
struggle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had endeavoured to do right, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
could not acquit herself of evil. But the pain, though it existed,
might at least be kept out of sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you are to go and live at Dunripple at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Marrable/Marrable/MISS MARRABLE</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Marrable.

<p/>``I suppose we shall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well! It's all right, I'm sure. Of course there is not a word to
be said against it. I hope Sir Gregory won't die before the Colonel.
That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Colonel is his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) father, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope there may not come to be trouble about it, that's all. I
shall be very lonely, but of course I had to expect that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll come to us, Aunt Sarah? You'll be as much there as here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, dear. I don't quite know about that. Sir Gregory is all
very well; but one does like one's own house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lowther/MARY LOWTHER</b></font>)</div><p/>From all which Mary understood that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dear aunt still wished that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own way in disposing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) niece's hand,--as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dear friends at Bullhampton had wished to have theirs.

<p/>The following were the answers from Mary to the two letters given

<p/>Loring, 3rd September, 186--.

<p/>DEAR JANET,

<p/>I am very, very, very sorry. I do not know what more I can
say. I meant to do well all through. When I first told Mr.
Gilmore that it could not be as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) wished it, I was right.
When I made up my mind that it must be so at last, I was
right also. I fear I cannot say so much of myself as to
that middle step which I took, thinking it was best to do
as I was bidden. I meant to be right, but of course I was
wrong, and I am very, very sorry. Nevertheless, I am much
obliged to you for writing to me. Of course I cannot but
desire to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) does. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) writes and seems to be
happy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>) travels, pray tell me.

<p/>I have much to tell you of my own happiness,--though, in
truth, I feel a remorse at being happy when I have caused
so much unhappiness. Walter is to sell out and to live
at Dunripple, and I also am to live there when we are
married. I suppose it will not be long now. I am writing
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) to-day, though I do not yet know what I shall say
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>). Sir Gregory has assented, and arrangements are to
be made, and lawyers are to be consulted, and we are to be
what Walter calls deputy Squire and Squiress at Dunripple.
Mrs. Brownlow and Edith Brownlow are still to live there,
but I am to have the honour of ordering the dinner, and
looking wise at the housekeeper. Of course I shall feel
very strange at going into such a house. To you I may
say how much nicer it would be to go to some place that
Walter and I could have to ourselves,--as you did when you
married. But I am not such a simpleton as to repine at
that. So much has gone as I would have it that I only feel
myself to be happier than I deserve. What I shall chiefly
look forward to will be your first visit to Dunripple.

<p/>Your most affectionate friend,

<p/>MARY LOWTHER.


<p/>The other letter, as to which Mary had declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not as
yet made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own mind when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wrote to Mrs. Fenwick, was more
difficult in composition.


<p/>Loring, 2nd September, 186--.

<p/>DEAREST WALTER,

<p/>So it is all settled, and I am to be a deputy Squiress! I
have no objection to urge. As long as you are the deputy
Squire, I will be the deputy Squiress. For your sake,
my dearest, I do most heartily rejoice that the affair
is settled. I think you will be happier as a county
gentleman than you would have been in the army; and as
Dunripple must ultimately be your home,--I will say our
home,--perhaps it is as well that you, and I also, should
know it as soon as possible. Of course I am very nervous
about Mrs. Brownlow and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) daughter; but though nervous I
am not fearful; and I shall prepare myself to like them.

<p/>As to that other matter, I hardly know what answer to make
on so very quick a questioning. It was only the other
day that it was decided that it was to be;--and there
ought to be breathing time before one also decides when.
But, dear Walter, I will do nothing to interfere with
your prospects. Let me know what you think yourself; but
remember, in thinking, that a little interval for purposes
of sentiment and of stitching is always desired by the
weaker vessel on such an occasion.

<p/>God bless you, my own one,

<p/>Yours always and always, M. L.

<p/>In real truth, I will do whatever you bid me.


<p/>Of course, after that, the marriage was not very long postponed.
Walter Marrable allowed that some grace should be given for
sentiment, and some also for stitching, but as to neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>)
feel that any long delay was needed. A week for sentiment, and two
more for the preparation of bridal adornments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) thought would be
sufficient. There was a compromise at last, as is usual in such
cases, and the marriage took place about the middle of October. No
doubt, at that time of year they went to Italy,--but of that the
present narrator is not able to speak with any certainty. This,
however, is certain,--that if they did travel abroad, Mary Marrable
travelled in daily fear lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) unlucky fate should bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
face to face with Mr. Gilmore. Wherever they went, their tour, in
accordance with a contract made by the baronet, was terminated within
two months. For on Christmas Day Mrs. Walter Marrable was to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
place as mistress of the house at the dinner table.

<p/>The reader may, perhaps, desire to know whether things were made
altogether smooth with the Colonel. On this matter Messrs. Block and
Curling, the family lawyers, encountered very much trouble indeed.
The Colonel, when application was made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), was as sweet as honey.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would do anything for the interests of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) dearest son. There did
not breathe a father on earth who cared less for himself or his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own
position. But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) must live. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) submitted to Messrs. Block and
Curling whether it was not necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) should live. Messrs.
Block and Curling explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) very clearly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) brother,
the baronet, had nothing to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) living or dying,--and that
towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) living he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had already robbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) son of a large property.
At last, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would not make over his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) life interest in the
property, as it would come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) brother dying
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), except on payment of an annuity on and from that date
of L200 a year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) began by asking L500, and was then told that the
Captain would run the chance and would sue his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father for the L20,000
in the event of Sir Gregory dying before the Colonel.

<p/>Now the narrator will bid adieu to Mary Lowther, to Loring, and to
Dunripple. The conduct of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) heroine, as depicted in these pages,
will, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loring</b></font>) fears, meet with the disapprobation of many close and good
judges of female character. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has endeavoured to describe a young
woman, prompted in all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doings by a conscience wide awake, guided
by principle, willing, if need be, to sacrifice herself, struggling
always to keep herself from doing wrong, but yet causing infinite
grief to others, and nearly bringing herself to utter shipwreck,
because, for a while, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) allowed herself to believe that it would be
right for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to marry a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not love.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXII.

<p/>AT TURNOVER CASTLE.


<p/>Mrs. Fenwick had many quips and quirks with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) husband as to those
tidings to be made in a pleasant spirit which were expected from
Turnover Castle. From the very moment that Lord St. George had given
the order,--upon the authority chiefly of the unfortunate Mr. Bolt,
who on this occasion found it to be impossible to refuse to give an
authority which a lord demanded from him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>),--the demolition of the
building had been commenced. Before the first Sunday came any use of
the new chapel for divine service was already impossible. On that
day Mr. Puddleham preached a stirring sermon about tabernacles in
general. <div class="bookquote">``It did not matter where the people of the Lord met,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``so long as they did meet to worship the Lord in a proper
spirit of independent resistance to any authority that had not come
to them from revelation. Any hedge-side was a sufficient tabernacle
for a devout Christian. But--,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then, without naming any name, he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>)
described the Church of England as a Upas tree which, by its poison,
destroyed those beautiful flowers which strove to spring up amidst
the rank grass beneath it and to make the air sweet within its
neighbourhood. Something he (<font color='blue'><b>Puddleham</b></font>) said, too, of a weak sister tottering to
its base, only to be followed in its ruin by the speedy prostration
of its elder brother. All this was of course told in detail to the
Vicar; but the Vicar refused even to be interested by it. <div class="bookquote">``Of course
he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``If a man is to preach, what can he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) preach
but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own views?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The tidings to be made in a pleasant spirit were not long waited
for,--or, at any rate, the first instalment of them. On the 2nd of
September there arrived a large hamper full of partridges, addressed
to Mrs. Fenwick in the Earl's own handwriting. <div class="bookquote">``The very first
fruits,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) went down to inspect the plentiful
provision thus made for the vicarage larder. Well;--it was certainly
better to have partridges from Turnover than accusations of
immorality and infidelity. The Vicar so declared at once, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
wife would not at first agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I really should have such
pleasure in packing them up and sending them back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, you shall do nothing of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The idea of a basket of birds to atone for such insults and calumny
as that man has heaped on you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The birds will be only a first instalment,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar,--and
then there were more quips and quirks about that. It was presumed by
Mr. Fenwick that the second instalment would be the first pheasants
shot in October. But the second instalment came before September was
over in the shape of the following note:--


<p/>Turnover Park, 20th September, 186--.

<p/>The Marquis of Trowbridge and the Ladies Sophie and
Carolina Stowte request that Mr. and Mrs. Fenwick will do
them the honour of coming to Turnover Park on Monday the
6th October, and staying till Saturday the 11th.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's an instalment indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fenwick. <div class="bookquote">``And now what on
earth are we to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div>The Vicar admitted that it had become very
serious. <div class="bookquote">``We must either go, and endure a terrible time of it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Fenwick, <div class="bookquote">``or we must show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very plainly that we
will have nothing more to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I don't see why we are to be
annoyed, merely because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a Marquis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't be because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a Marquis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why then? You can't say that you love the old man, or that the
Ladies Sophie and Carolina Stowte are the women you'd have me choose
for companions, or that that soapy, silky, humbugging Lord St. George
is to your taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure about St. George. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can be everything to everybody,
and would make an excellent bishop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and you know also that you will have a
very bad time of it at Turnover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could shoot pheasants all the week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--with a conviction at the time that the Ladies Sophie and
Carolina were calling you an infidel behind your back for doing so.
As for myself I feel perfectly certain that I should spar with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't because he (<font color='blue'><b>infidel</b></font>)'s a Marquis,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, carrying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
argument after a long pause. <div class="bookquote">``If I know myself, I think I may say
that that has no allurement for me. And, to tell the truth, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
been simply a Marquis, and had I been at liberty to indulge my own
wishes, I would never have allowed myself to be talked out of my
righteous anger by that soft-tongued son of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). But to us he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is a
man of the very greatest importance, because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) owns the land on
which the people live with whom we are concerned. It is for their
welfare that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and I should be on good terms together; and therefore
if you don't mind the sacrifice, I think we'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What;--for the whole week, Frank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>The Vicar was of opinion that the week might be judiciously
curtailed by two days; and, consequently, Mrs. Fenwick presented her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>)
compliments to the Ladies Sophie and Carolina Stowte, and expressed
the great pleasure which she (<font color='blue'><b>Stowte</b></font>) and Mr. Fenwick would have in going to
Turnover Park on the Tuesday, and staying till the Friday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So that I shall only be shooting two days,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, <div class="bookquote">``which
will modify the aspect of my infidelity considerably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>They went to Turnover Castle. The poor old Marquis had rather a bad
time of it for the hour or two previous to their arrival. It had
become an acknowledged fact now in the county that Sam Brattle had
had nothing to do with the murder of Farmer Trumbull, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
acquaintance with the murderers had sprung from his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) desire to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
unfortunate sister settled in marriage with a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) at the time
did not know to be disreputable. There had therefore been a reaction
in favour of Sam Brattle, whom the county now began to regard as
something of a hero. The Marquis, understanding all that, had come to
be aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had wronged the Vicar in that matter of the murder.
And then, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been told upon very good authority,--no less
than that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) daughters, who had been so informed by the sisters
of a most exemplary neighbouring curate,--that Mr. Fenwick was a man
who believed <div class="bookquote">``just next to nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fenwick a man</b></font>)</div>and would just as soon associate
with a downright Pagan like old Brattle, as with any professing
Christian,--still there was the fact of the Bishop's good opinion;
and, though the Marquis was a self-willed man, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) a bishop was
always a bishop. It was also clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had been misled in
those charges which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had made against the Vicar in that matter of
poor Carry Brattle's residence at Salisbury. Something of the truth
of the girl's history had come to the ears of the Marquis, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
had been made to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had been wrong. Then there was the
affair of the chapel, in which, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son's advice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was at
this moment expending L700 in rectifying the mistake which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had
made. In giving the Marquis his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) due we must acknowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) cared
but little about the money. Marquises, though they may have large
properties, are not always in possession of any number of loose
hundreds which they can throw away without feeling the loss. Nor was
the Marquis of Trowbridge so circumstanced now. But that trouble did
not gall him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) nearly so severely as the necessity which was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) to
rectify an error made by himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) had done a foolish thing. Under
no circumstances should the chapel have been built on that spot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
knew it now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) must apologise. Noblesse oblige.
The old lord was very stupid, very wrong-headed, and sometimes very
arrogant; but he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) would not do a wrong if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knew it, and nothing on
earth would make him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) tell a wilful lie. The epithet indeed might have
been omitted; for a lie is not a lie unless it be wilful.

<p/>Lord Trowbridge passed the hours of this Tuesday morning under
the frightful sense of the necessity for apologising;--and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>)
remembered well the impudence of the man, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) had ventured to
allude to the Ladies Stowte, likening them to--to--to--! It was
terrible to be thought of. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Trowbridge</b></font>) lordship remembered, too, how
this man had written about the principal entrance to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own mansion
as though it had been no more than the entrance to any other man's
house! Though the thorns still rankled in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own flesh, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to
own that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself had been wrong.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did it,--with an honesty that was beyond the reach of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) much
more clever son. When the Fenwicks arrived, they were taken into the
drawing-room, in which were sitting the Ladies Sophie and Carolina
with various guests already assembled at the Castle. In a minute or
two the Marquis shuffled in and shook hands with the two new comers.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) shuffled about the room for another minute or two, and at
last got his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) arm through that of the Vicar, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) away into his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
own sanctum. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fenwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I think it best to express my
regret at once for two things that have occurred.''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: The drawing-room at Turnover Castle.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not signify, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it does signify to me, and if you will listen to me for a moment
I shall take your doing so as a favour added to that which you have
conferred upon me in coming here.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div>The Vicar could only bow and
listen. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry, Mr. Fenwick, that I should have written to the
bishop of this diocese in reference to your conduct.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fenwick/Fenwick/MR. FENWICK</b></font>)</div>Fenwick found
it very difficult to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) tongue when this was said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) imagined
that the Marquis was going to excuse himself about the chapel,--and
about the chapel he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) cared nothing at all. But as to that letter to
the bishop, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did feel that the less said about it the better. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
restrained himself, however, and the Marquis went on. <div class="bookquote">``Things had
been told me, Mr. Fenwick;--and I thought that I was doing my duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It did me no harm, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe not. I had been misinformed,--and I apologise.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Marquis</b></font>)</div>The
Marquis paused, and the Vicar bowed. It is probable that the Vicar
did not at all know how deep at that moment were the sufferings of
the Marquis. <div class="bookquote">``And now as to the chapel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>continued the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord, that is such a trifle that you must let me say that it is
not and has not been of the slightest consequence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was misled as to that bit of ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only wish, my lord, that the chapel could stand there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is impossible. The land has been appropriated to other
purposes, and though we have all been a little in the dark about
our own rights, right must be done. I will only add that I have the
greatest satisfaction in seeing you and Mrs. Fenwick at Turnover, and
that I hope the satisfaction may often be repeated.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) led the
way back into the drawing-room, and the evil hour had passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
head.

<p/>Upon the whole, things went very well with both the Vicar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
wife during their visit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) did go out shooting one day, and was
treated very civilly by the Turnover gamekeeper, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was
prepared with no five-pound note at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) day's amusement.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) returned to the house, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) host congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
performance just as cordially as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had been one of the laity.
On the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) rode over with Lord St. George to see the County
Hunt kennels, which were then at Charleycoats, and nobody seemed to
think him (<font color='blue'><b>Hunt</b></font>) very wicked because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hunt</b></font>) ventured to have an opinion about
hounds. Mrs. Fenwick's amusements were, perhaps, less exciting, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) went through them with equanimity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) was taken to see the
parish schools, and was walked into the parish church,--in which the
Stowte family were possessed of an enormous recess called a pew,
but which was in truth a room, with a fireplace in it. Mrs. Fenwick
thought it did not look very much like a church; but as the Ladies
Stowte were clearly very proud of it she (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Fenwick</b></font>) peace as to that
idea. And so the visit to Turnover Park was made, and the Fenwicks
were driven home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After all, there's nothing like burying the hatchet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stowte</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But who sharpened the hatchet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fenwick</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Fenwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind who sharpened it. We've buried it.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXIII.

<p/>CONCLUSION.


<p/>There is nothing further left to be told of this story of the village
of Bullhampton and its Vicar beyond what may be necessary to satisfy
the reader as to the condition and future prospects of the Brattle
family. The writer of these pages ventures to hope that whatever may
have been the fate in the readers' mind of that couple which are
about to settle themselves peaceably at Dunripple, and to wait there
in comfort till their own time for reigning shall have come, some
sympathy may have been felt with those humbler personages who have
lived with orderly industry at the mill,--as, also, with those who,
led away by disorderly passions, have strayed away from it, and have
come back again to the old home.

<p/>For a couple of days after the return of the miller with his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) daughter
and son, very little was said about the past;--very little, at
least, in which either the father or Sam took any part. Between the
two sisters there were no doubt questions and answers by the hour
together as to every smallest detail of the occurrences at Salisbury.
And the mother almost sang hymns of joy over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child, in that the
hour which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had so much dreaded had passed by. But the miller said
not a word;--and Sam was almost equally silent. <div class="bookquote">``But it be all over,
Sam?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother, anxiously one day. <div class="bookquote">``For certain sure it be
all over now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one, mother, for whom it ain't all over yet;--poor devil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was the--murderer, Sam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So was t`other fellow. There weren't no difference. If one was more
spry to kill t`old chap than t`other, Acorn was the spryest. That's
what I think. But it's done now, and there ain't been much justice in
it. As far as I sees, there never ain't much justice. They was nigh
a-hanging o' me; and if those chaps had thought o' bringing t`old
man's box nigh the mill, instead of over by t`old woman's cottage,
they would a hung me;--outright. And then they was twelve months
about it! I don't think much on 'em.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother tried to
continue the conversation,--which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have loved to do with
that morbid interest which we always take in a matter which has been
nearly fatal to us, but from which we have escaped,--Sam turned into
the mill, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had had enough of it, and wouldn't have any
more.

<p/>Then, on the third day, a report of the trial in a county newspaper
reached them. This the miller read all through, painfully, from the
beginning to the end, omitting no detail of the official occurrences.
At last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) came to the account of Sam's evidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) got up
from the chair on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was sitting close to the window, and
striking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) fist upon the table, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) first and last comment
upon the trial. <div class="bookquote">``It was well said, Sam. Yes; though thou be'est my
own, it was well said.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) put the paper down and walked out of
doors, and they could see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) eyes were full of tears.

<p/>But from that time forth there came a great change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) manner to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) youngest daughter. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Carry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would say to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in the
morning, with as much outward sign of affection as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) ever showed to
any one; and at night, when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) came and stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) weary limbs out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) chair to take himself away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) forehead to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to be kissed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) did to that
better daughter who had needed no forgiveness from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). Nevertheless,
they who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>),--and there were none who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) better than
Fanny did,--were aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) never for a moment forgot the disgrace
which had fallen upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) household. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had forgiven the sinner, but
the shame of the sin was always on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) carried himself as a
man who was bound to hide himself from the eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) neighbours
because there had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) a misfortune which made it fit that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) should live in retirement.

<p/>Sam took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) abode in the house, and worked daily in the mill,
and for weeks nothing was said either of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) going away or of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
return. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would talk to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sisters of the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had
worked among the machinery of the Durham mine at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had found
employment; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said nothing for awhile of the cause which had
taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) north, or of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) purpose of remaining where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) ate
and drank in the house, and from time to time his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
small sums as wages. At last, sitting one evening after the work of
the day was done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) spoke out his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'm
about minded to get me a wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother and sisters were all there
and heard the proposition made.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who is the girl as is to have thee, Sam?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother.

<p/>As Sam did not answer at once, Carry replied for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Who should it
be, mother;--but only Agnes Pope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ain't that `un?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miller</b></font>)</div>said the miller, surlily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why shouldn't it be that `un, father? It is that `un, and no
other. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) be not liked here, why, we'll just go further, and
perhaps not fare worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Agnes Pope/Agnes</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing to be said against poor Agnes Pope,--only this,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had been in Trumbull's house on the night of the murder, and
had for awhile been suspected by the police of having communicated
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) lover the tidings of the farmer's box of money. Evil things
had of course been said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) then, but the words spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had
been proved to be untrue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had been taken from the farmer's house
into that of the Vicar,--who had, indeed, been somewhat abused by
the Puddlehamites for harbouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>); but as the belief in Sam's
guilt had gradually been abandoned, so, of course, had the ground
disappeared for supposing that poor Agnes had had ought to do in
bringing about the murder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) late master. For two days the miller
was very gloomy, and made no reply when Sam declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) purpose of
leaving the mill before Christmas unless Agnes should be received
there as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) wife;--but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) gave way. <div class="bookquote">``As the old `uns go into
their graves,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's no more than nature that the young `uns
should become masters.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so Sam was married, and was taken, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) wife, to live with the other Brattles at the mill. It was well
for the miller that it should be so, for Sam was a man who would
surely earn money when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) shoulder in earnest to the wheel.

<p/>As for Carry, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lived still with them, doomed by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beauty, as was
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) elder sister by the want of it, to expect that no lover should
come and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to establish with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) a homestead of their own.

<p/>Our friend the Vicar married Sam and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sweetheart, and is still
often at the mill. From time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) has made efforts to convert
the unbelieving old man whose grave is now so near to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) feet; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) has never prevailed to make the miller own even the need of any
change. <div class="bookquote">``I've struv' to be honest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said, when last he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was thus
attacked, <div class="bookquote">``and I've wrought for my wife and bairns. I ain't been a
drunkard, nor yet, as I knows on, neither a tale-bearer, nor yet a
liar. I've been harsh-tempered and dour enough I know, and maybe it's
fitting as they shall be hard and dour to me where I'm going. I don't
say again it, Muster Fenwick;--but nothing as I can do now 'll change
it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This, at any rate, was clear to the Vicar,--that Death, when it
came, would come without making the old man tremble.

<p/>Mr. Gilmore has been some years away from Bullhampton; but when I
last heard from my friends in that village I was told that at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilmore</b></font>)
was expected home.

do not know whether this is a typographical error or
an example of Trollope's inconsistency with the names
of minor characters.

<p/>Chapter XL, paragraph 28. The astute reader of Trollope
will recognize the <div class="bookquote">``Dragon of Wantley''  (<font color='red'><b>Trollope/Anthony Trollope/ANTHONY TROLLOPE</b></font>)</div>as the name of
the hostelry inherited by Mr. Harding's daughter Eleanor
in the <div class="bookquote">``Barsetshire''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding daughter Eleanor</b></font>)</div>novels.

<p/>Specific changes in wording of the text are listed below.

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>was changed to <div class="bookquote">``Chamberlaine''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>in the sentence: His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mother
had been the sister of the Rev. Henry Fitzackerly
Chamberlaine; and as Mr. CHAMBERLAINE had never married,

Marsala every day, and let it be clearly understood that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) COULDN``T afford sherry.

<p/>Chapter XXII, paragraph 1. <div class="bookquote">``Bullhampton''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was changed to

carried on a long and angry correspondence with the

continued to toddle into the village just at eleven
o'clock.

<p/>Chapter XXVIII, paragraph 9. The word <div class="bookquote">``shoudn't''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was

<p/>Chapter XXXII, paragraph 26. The word <div class="bookquote">``friend's''  (<font color='red'><b>this captain</b></font>)</div>was
changed to the plural <div class="bookquote">``friends'''  (<font color='red'><b>this captain</b></font>)</div>in the sentence:
Had not this dangerous captain come up, Mary, no
doubt,--so thought Miss Marrable,--would at last have
complied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marrable</b></font>) FRIENDS' advice, and have accepted
a marriage which was in all respects advantageous.

<p/>Chapter XXXV, paragraph 3. The word <div class="bookquote">``began''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was
changed to <div class="bookquote">``begun''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>in the sentence: ... and had
long since BEGUN to feel that a few cabbages and
peaches did not repay him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) for the loss of those
pleasant and bitter things, ...

<p/>Chapter XXXIX, paragraph 13. <div class="bookquote">``Gay''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jay/Jay/Mrs. JAY</b></font>)</div>was changed to <div class="bookquote">``Jay''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jay/Jay/Mrs. JAY</b></font>)</div>in the sentence: Mrs. JAY, no doubt, is a religious
woman. We do not know whether this was a typographical
error or another example of Trollope's inconsistency
with names of minor characters.

<p/>Chapter XLII, paragraph 5. A hyphen was removed from
<div class="bookquote">``any-rate''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in the sentence: His (<font color='blue'><b>Trollope</b></font>) gown was of silk, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trollope</b></font>) income almost greater than his (<font color='blue'><b>Trollope</b></font>) desires; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Trollope</b></font>)

order that the unnecessary heat coming from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quickenham</b></font>) mouth
might not be wasted.

<p/>Chapter XLVIII, paragraph 2. The word <div class="bookquote">``injustice''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was

himself, too, of the murderer's present escape from
JUSTICE by aid of this pestilent clergyman; ...

<p/>Chapter XLVIII, paragraph 4. <div class="bookquote">``St.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was added to the
sentence: He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had already told St. George of Fenwick's
letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) and of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) letter to the bishop, and
ST. George had whistled.

<p/>Chapter XLIX, paragraph 21. The words <div class="bookquote">``much as''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>were
added to the sentence: I believe I owe as much to
you,--almost as MUCH AS a woman can owe to a man;
but still, were my cousin so placed that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could
afford to marry a poor wife, I should leave you and
go to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) at once.

<p/>1.F.

<p/>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
<div class="bookquote">``Defects,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

<p/>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the <div class="bookquote">``Right
of Replacement or Refund''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

<p/>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money -LRB-if any-RRB- you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with

<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<p/>http://www.gutenberg.org

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
