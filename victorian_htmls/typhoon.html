<p/>Far as the mariner on highest mast Can see all around upon the calmed
vast, So wide was Neptune's hall ... -- KEATS



<p/>AUTHOR'S NOTE

<p/>The main characteristic of this volume consists in this, that all the
stories composing it belong not only to the same period but have been
written one after another in the order in which they appear in the book.

<p/>The period is that which follows on my connection with Blackwood's
Magazine. I had just finished writing <div class="bookquote">``The End of the Tether''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and was
casting about for some subject which could be developed in a shorter
form than the tales in the volume of <div class="bookquote">``Youth''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>when the instance of a
steamship full of returning coolies from Singapore to some port in
northern China occurred to my recollection. Years before I had heard
it being talked about in the East as a recent occurrence. It was for us
merely one subject of conversation amongst many others of the kind. Men
earning their bread in any very specialized occupation will talk shop,
not only because it is the most vital interest of their lives but also
because they have not much knowledge of other subjects. They have never
had the time to get acquainted with them. Life, for most of us, is not
so much a hard as an exacting taskmaster.

<p/>I never met anybody personally concerned in this affair, the interest of
which for us was, of course, not the bad weather but the extraordinary
complication brought into the ship's life at a moment of exceptional
stress by the human element below her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) deck. Neither was the story itself
ever enlarged upon in my hearing. In that company each of us could
imagine easily what the whole thing was like. The financial difficulty
of it, presenting also a human problem, was solved by a mind much too
simple to be perplexed by anything in the world except men's idle talk
for which it was not adapted.

<p/>From the first the mere anecdote, the mere statement I might say, that
such a thing had happened on the high seas, appeared to me a sufficient
subject for meditation. Yet it was but a bit of a sea yarn after all. I
felt that to bring out its deeper significance which was quite apparent
to me, something other, something more was required; a leading motive
that would harmonize all these violent noises, and a point of view that
would put all that elemental fury into its proper place.

<p/>What was needed of course was Captain MacWhirr. Directly I perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
I could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was the man for the situation. I don't mean to
say that I ever saw Captain MacWhirr in the flesh, or had ever come in
contact with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) literal mind and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) dauntless temperament. MacWhirr is
not an acquaintance of a few hours, or a few weeks, or a few months. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
is the product of twenty years of life. My own life. Conscious invention
had little to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). If it is true that Captain MacWhirr never
walked and breathed on this earth -LRB-which I find for my part extremely
difficult to believe-RRB- I can also assure my readers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is perfectly
authentic. I may venture to assert the same of every aspect of the
story, while I confess that the particular typhoon of the tale was not a
typhoon of my actual experience.

<p/>At its first appearance <div class="bookquote">``Typhoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>some critics</b></font>)</div>the story, was classed by some
critics as a deliberately intended storm-piece. Others picked out
MacWhirr, in whom they perceived a definite symbolic intention. Neither
was exclusively my intention. Both the typhoon and Captain MacWhirr
presented themselves to me as the necessities of the deep conviction
with which I approached the subject of the story. It was their
opportunity. It was also my opportunity; and it would be vain to
discourse about what I made of it in a handful of pages, since the pages
themselves are here, between the covers of this volume, to speak for
themselves.

<p/>This is a belated reflection. If it had occurred to me before it would
have perhaps done away with the existence of this Author's Note; for,
indeed, the same remark applies to every story in this volume. None
of them are stories of experience in the absolute sense of the word.
Experience in them is but the canvas of the attempted picture. Each of
them has its more than one intention. With each the question is what the
writer has done with his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) opportunity; and each answers the question for
itself in words which, if I may say so without undue solemnity, were
written with a conscientious regard for the truth of my own sensations.
And each of those stories, to mean something, must justify itself in its
own way to the conscience of each successive reader.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Falk'' (<font color='red'><b>critic</b></font>)</div>--the second story in the volume--offended the delicacy of one
critic at least by certain peculiarities of its subject. But what is the
subject of <div class="bookquote">``Falk'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>? I personally do not feel so very certain about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>)
who reads must find out for himself. My intention in writing <div class="bookquote">``Falk''
 (<font color='red'><b>shock anybody</b></font>)</div>was not to shock anybody. As in most of my writings I insist not on
the events but on their effect upon the persons in the tale. But in
everything I have written there is always one invariable intention, and
that is to capture the reader's attention, by securing his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) interest and
enlisting his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) sympathies for the matter in hand, whatever it may be,
within the limits of the visible world and within the boundaries of
human emotions.

<p/>I may safely say that Falk is absolutely true to my experience of
certain straightforward characters combining a perfectly natural
ruthlessness with a certain amount of moral delicacy. Falk obeys the law
of self-preservation without the slightest misgivings as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Falk</b></font>) right,
but at a crucial turn of that ruthlessly preserved life he (<font color='blue'><b>Falk</b></font>) will not
condescend to dodge the truth. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Falk</b></font>) is presented as sensitive enough to
be affected permanently by a certain unusual experience, that experience
had to be set by me before the reader vividly; but it is not the subject
of the tale. If we go by mere facts then the subject is Falk's attempt
to get married; in which the narrator of the tale finds himself
unexpectedly involved both on its ruthless and its delicate side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Falk''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>shares with one other of my stories -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``The Return''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in the <div class="bookquote">``Tales
of Unrest''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>volume-RRB- the distinction of never having been serialized. I
think the copy was shown to the editor of some magazine who rejected it
indignantly on the sole ground that <div class="bookquote">``the girl never says anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div>This
is perfectly true. From first to last Hermann's niece utters no word in
the tale--and it is not because she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) is dumb, but for the simple reason
that whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) happens to come under the observation of the narrator
she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) has either no occasion or is too profoundly moved to speak. The
editor, who obviously had read the story, might have perceived that for
himself. Apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) did not, and I refrained from pointing out the
impossibility to him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) because, since he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) did not venture to say that <div class="bookquote">``the
girl''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>did not live, I felt no concern at his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) indignation.

<p/>All the other stories were serialized. The <div class="bookquote">``Typhoon''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>appeared in the
early numbers of the Pall Mall Magazine, then under the direction of the
late Mr. Halkett. It was on that occasion, too, that I saw for the first
time my conceptions rendered by an artist in another medium. Mr. Maurice
Grieffenhagen knew how to combine in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) illustrations the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
own most distinguished personal vision with an absolute fidelity to the
inspiration of the writer. <div class="bookquote">``Amy Foster''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy Foster/Amy</b></font>)</div>was published in The Illustrated
London News with a fine drawing of Amy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) day out giving tea to the
children at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) home, in a hat with a big feather. <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>appeared
first in the Pall Mall Magazine. Of that story I will only say that
it struck many people by its adaptability to the stage and that I was
induced to dramatize it under the title of <div class="bookquote">``One Day More'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>; up to the
present my only effort in that direction. I may also add that each of
the four stories on their appearance in book form was picked out on
various grounds as the <div class="bookquote">``best of the lot''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>by different critics, who
reviewed the volume with a warmth of appreciation and understanding, a
sympathetic insight and a friendliness of expression for which I cannot
be sufficiently grateful.


<p/>1919. J. C.



<p/>TYPHOON

<p/>I

<p/>Captain MacWhirr, of the steamer Nan-Shan, had a physiognomy that, in
the order of material appearances, was the exact counterpart of his (<font color='blue'><b>counterpart</b></font>)
mind: it presented no marked characteristics of firmness or stupidity;
it had no pronounced characteristics whatever; it was simply ordinary,
irresponsive, and unruffled.

<p/>The only thing his (<font color='blue'><b>counterpart</b></font>) aspect might have been said to suggest, at times, was
bashfulness; because he (<font color='blue'><b>counterpart</b></font>) would sit, in business offices ashore, sunburnt
and smiling faintly, with downcast eyes. When he (<font color='blue'><b>counterpart</b></font>) raised them, they were
perceived to be direct in their glance and of blue colour. His (<font color='blue'><b>counterpart</b></font>) hair was
fair and extremely fine, clasping from temple to temple the bald dome
of his (<font color='blue'><b>counterpart</b></font>) skull in a clamp as of fluffy silk. The hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>counterpart</b></font>) face, on the
contrary, carroty and flaming, resembled a growth of copper wire clipped
short to the line of the lip; while, no matter how close he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) shaved,
fiery metallic gleams passed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) head, over the
surface of his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) cheeks. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was rather below the medium height, a bit
round-shouldered, and so sturdy of limb that his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) clothes always looked a
shade too tight for his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) arms and legs. As if unable to grasp what is due
to the difference of latitudes, he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) wore a brown bowler hat, a complete
suit of a brownish hue, and clumsy black boots. These harbour togs gave
to his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) thick figure an air of stiff and uncouth smartness. A thin silver
watch chain looped his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) waistcoat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) never left his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) ship for the
shore without clutching in his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) powerful, hairy fist an elegant umbrella
of the very best quality, but generally unrolled. Young Jukes, the chief
mate, attending his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) commander to the gangway, would sometimes venture
to say, with the greatest gentleness, <div class="bookquote">``Allow me, sir'' (<font color='red'><b>commander</b></font>)</div>--and possessing
himself of the umbrella deferentially, would elevate the ferule, shake
the folds, twirl a neat furl in a jiffy, and hand it back; going through
the performance with a face of such portentous gravity, that Mr. Solomon
Rout, the chief engineer, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) morning cigar over the skylight,
would turn away his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) head in order to hide a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! aye! The blessed
gamp... Thank `ee, Jukes, thank `ee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>would mutter Captain MacWhirr,
heartily, without looking up.

<p/>Having just enough imagination to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) through each successive day,
and no more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was tranquilly sure of himself; and from the very same
cause he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was not in the least conceited. It is your imaginative superior
who is touchy, overbearing, and difficult to please; but every ship
Captain MacWhirr commanded was the floating abode of harmony and peace.
It was, in truth, as impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to take a flight of fancy as
it would be for a watchmaker to put together a chronometer with nothing
except a two-pound hammer and a whip-saw in the way of tools. Yet the
uninteresting lives of men so entirely given to the actuality of the
bare existence have their mysterious side. It was impossible in Captain
MacWhirr's case, for instance, to understand what under heaven could
have induced that perfectly satisfactory son of a petty grocer in
Belfast to run away to sea. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had done that very thing at the
age of fifteen. It was enough, when you thought it over, to give you the
idea of an immense, potent, and invisible hand thrust into the ant-heap
of the earth, laying hold of shoulders, knocking heads together, and
setting the unconscious faces of the multitude towards inconceivable
goals and in undreamt-of directions.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father never really forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) for this undutiful stupidity. <div class="bookquote">``We
could have got on without him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) used to say later on, <div class="bookquote">``but there's
the business. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) an only son, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother wept very much after
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) disappearance. As it had never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to leave word behind,
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was mourned over for dead till, after eight months, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) first letter
arrived from Talcahuano. It was short, and contained the statement:
<div class="bookquote">``We had very fine weather on our passage out.''  (<font color='red'><b>the writer</b></font>)</div>But evidently, in the
writer's mind, the only important intelligence was to the effect that
his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) captain had, on the very day of writing, entered him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) regularly on
the ship's articles as Ordinary Seaman. <div class="bookquote">``Because I can do the work,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Seaman</b></font>)
explained. The mother again wept copiously, while the remark, <div class="bookquote">``Tom's an
ass,''  (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div>expressed the emotions of the father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a corpulent man, with
a gift for sly chaffing, which to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) exercised
in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) intercourse with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son, a little pityingly, as if upon a
half-witted person.

<p/>MacWhirr's visits to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) home were necessarily rare, and in the course
of years he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) despatched other letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) parents, informing them of
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) successive promotions and of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) movements upon the vast earth. In
these missives could be found sentences like this: <div class="bookquote">``The heat here is
very great.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Or: <div class="bookquote">``On Christmas day at 4 P. M. we fell in with some
icebergs.''  (<font color='red'><b>The people</b></font>)</div>The old people ultimately became acquainted with a good
many names of ships, and with the names of the skippers who commanded
them--with the names of Scots and English shipowners--with the names
of seas, oceans, straits, promontories--with outlandish names of
lumber-ports, of rice-ports, of cotton-ports--with the names of
islands--with the name of their son's young woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was called Lucy.
It did not suggest itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to mention whether he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) thought the name
pretty. And then they died.

<p/>The great day of MacWhirr's marriage came in due course, following
shortly upon the great day when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) first command.

<p/>All these events had taken place many years before the morning when, in
the chart-room of the steamer Nan-Shan, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) stood confronted by the
fall of a barometer he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had no reason to distrust. The fall--taking into
account the excellence of the instrument, the time of the year, and
the ship's position on the terrestrial globe--was of a nature ominously
prophetic; but the red face of the man betrayed no sort of inward
disturbance. Omens were as nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unable to discover
the message of a prophecy till the fulfilment had brought it home to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
very door. <div class="bookquote">``That's a fall, and no mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``There must be
some uncommonly dirty weather knocking about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>coolies</b></font>)</div><p/>The Nan-Shan was on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) way from the southward to the treaty port of
Fu-chau, with some cargo in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lower holds, and two hundred Chinese
coolies returning to their village homes in the province of Fo-kien,
after a few years of work in various tropical colonies. The morning was
fine, the oily sea heaved without a sparkle, and there was a queer white
misty patch in the sky like a halo of the sun. The fore-deck, packed
with Chinamen, was full of sombre clothing, yellow faces, and pigtails,
sprinkled over with a good many naked shoulders, for there was no wind,
and the heat was close. The coolies lounged, talked, smoked, or stared
over the rail; some, drawing water over the side, sluiced each other;
a few slept on hatches, while several small parties of six sat on their
heels surrounding iron trays with plates of rice and tiny teacups; and
every single Celestial of them was carrying with him (<font color='blue'><b>Celestial</b></font>) all he (<font color='blue'><b>Celestial</b></font>) had in the
world--a wooden chest with a ringing lock and brass on the corners,
containing the savings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Celestial</b></font>) labours: some clothes of ceremony,
sticks of incense, a little opium maybe, bits of nameless rubbish of
conventional value, and a small hoard of silver dollars, toiled for in
coal lighters, won in gambling-houses or in petty trading, grubbed out
of earth, sweated out in mines, on railway lines, in deadly jungle,
under heavy burdens--amassed patiently, guarded with care, cherished
fiercely.

<p/>A cross swell had set in from the direction of Formosa Channel about ten
oclock, without disturbing these passengers much, because the Nan-Shan,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>passengers</b></font>) flat bottom, rolling chocks on bilges, and great breadth of
beam, had the reputation of an exceptionally steady ship in a sea-way.
Mr. Jukes, in moments of expansion on shore, would proclaim loudly
that the <div class="bookquote">``old girl was as good as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was pretty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>It would never have
occurred to Captain MacWhirr to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) favourable opinion so loud
or in terms so fanciful.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) was a good ship, undoubtedly, and not old either. She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) had been built
in Dumbarton less than three years before, to the order of a firm of
merchants in Siam--Messrs. Sigg and Son. When she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) lay afloat, finished
in every detail and ready to take up the work of her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) life, the builders
contemplated her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) with pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sigg has asked us for a reliable skipper to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out,''  (<font color='red'><b>the partners</b></font>)</div>remarked one
of the partners; and the other, after reflecting for a while, said:
<div class="bookquote">``I think MacWhirr is ashore just at present.''  (<font color='red'><b>the partners</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>)? Then wire him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>)
at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>)'s the very man,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>declared the senior, without a moment's
hesitation.

<p/>Next morning MacWhirr stood before them unperturbed, having travelled
from London by the midnight express after a sudden but undemonstrative
parting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was the daughter of a superior couple who had
seen better days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had better be going together over the ship, Captain,''  (<font color='red'><b>the partner men</b></font>)</div>said the
senior partner; and the three men started to view the perfections of the
Nan-Shan from stem to stern, and from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) keelson to the trucks of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
two stumpy pole-masts.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr had begun by taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) coat, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hung on the
end of a steam windless embodying all the latest improvements.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My uncle wrote of you favourably by yesterday's mail to our good
friends--Messrs. Sigg, you know--and doubtless they'll continue you out
there in command,''  (<font color='red'><b>the partner</b></font>)</div>said the junior partner. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be able to boast of
being in charge of the handiest boat of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) size on the coast of China,
Captain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you? Thank `ee,''  (<font color='red'><b>a tourist</b></font>)</div>mumbled vaguely MacWhirr, to whom the view of
a distant eventuality could appeal no more than the beauty of a wide
landscape to a purblind tourist; and his (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) eyes happening at the moment to
be at rest upon the lock of the cabin door, he (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) walked up to it, full of
purpose, and began to rattle the handle vigorously, while he (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) observed,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) low, earnest voice, <div class="bookquote">``You can't trust the workmen nowadays. A
brand-new lock, and it won't act at all. Stuck fast. See? See?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as they found themselves alone in their office across the yard:
<div class="bookquote">``You praised that fellow up to Sigg. What is it you see in him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>asked
the nephew, with faint contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I admit he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has nothing of your fancy skipper about him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), if that's what
you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the elder man, curtly. <div class="bookquote">``Is the foreman of the joiners
on the Nan-Shan outside? ... Come in, Bates. How is it that you let
Tait's people put us off with a defective lock on the cabin door? The
Captain could see directly he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) set eye on it. Have it replaced at once.
The little straws, Bates ... the little straws...''

 (<font color='red'><b>prospects</b></font>)</div><p/>The lock was replaced accordingly, and a few days afterwards the
Nan-Shan steamed out to the East, without MacWhirr having offered any
further remark as to her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) fittings, or having been heard to utter a
single word hinting at pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ship, gratitude for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appointment,
or satisfaction at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prospects.

<p/>With a temperament neither loquacious nor taciturn he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found very little
occasion to talk. There were matters of duty, of course--directions,
orders, and so on; but the past being to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind done with, and the
future not there yet, the more general actualities of the day required
no comment--because facts can speak for themselves with overwhelming
precision.

<p/>Old Mr. Sigg liked a man of few words, and one that <div class="bookquote">``you could be sure
would not try to improve upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) instructions.''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>MacWhirr satisfying
these requirements, was continued in command of the Nan-Shan, and
applied himself to the careful navigation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) ship in the China seas.
She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come out on a British register, but after some time Messrs. Sigg
judged it expedient to transfer her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the Siamese flag.

<p/>At the news of the contemplated transfer Jukes grew restless, as if
under a sense of personal affront. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) went about grumbling to himself,
and uttering short scornful laughs. <div class="bookquote">``Fancy having a ridiculous
Noah's Ark elephant in the ensign of one's ship,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said once at the
engine-room door. <div class="bookquote">``Dash me if I can stand it: I'll throw up the billet.
Don't it make you sick, Mr. Rout?''  (<font color='red'><b>The engineer</b></font>)</div>The chief engineer only cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>)
throat with the air of a man who knows the value of a good billet.

<p/>The first morning the new flag floated over the stern of the Nan-Shan
Jukes stood looking at it bitterly from the bridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) struggled with
his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) feelings for a while, and then remarked, <div class="bookquote">``Queer flag for a man to
sail under, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with the flag?''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>inquired Captain MacWhirr. <div class="bookquote">``Seems all
right to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) walked across to the end of the bridge to have a
good look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it looks queer to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>burst out Jukes, greatly exasperated, and
flung off the bridge.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr was amazed at these manners. After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) stepped
quietly into the chart-room, and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) International Signal
Code-book at the plate where the flags of all the nations are correctly
figured in gaudy rows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) finger over them, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) came to
Siam he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) contemplated with great attention the red field and the white
elephant. Nothing could be more simple; but to make sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) brought the
book out on the bridge for the purpose of comparing the coloured drawing
with the real thing at the flagstaff astern. When next Jukes, who was
carrying on the duty that day with a sort of suppressed fierceness,
happened on the bridge, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) commander observed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing amiss with that flag.''

 (<font color='red'><b>commander</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>mumbled Jukes, falling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) knees before a deck-locker
and jerking therefrom viciously a spare lead-line.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I looked up the book. Length twice the breadth and the elephant
exactly in the middle. I thought the people ashore would know how to
make the local flag. Stands to reason. You were wrong, Jukes...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>began Jukes, getting up excitedly, <div class="bookquote">``all I can say--''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
fumbled for the end of the coil of line with trembling hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right.''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Captain MacWhirr soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), sitting heavily on a
little canvas folding-stool he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) greatly affected. <div class="bookquote">``All you have to do is
to take care they don't hoist the elephant upside-down before they get
quite used to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes flung the new lead-line over on the fore-deck with a loud <div class="bookquote">``Here
you are, bo'ss'en--don't forget to wet it thoroughly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>and turned with
immense resolution towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) commander; but Captain MacWhirr spread
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) elbows on the bridge-rail comfortably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it would be, I suppose, understood as a signal of distress,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
went on. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think? That elephant there, I take it, stands for
something in the nature of the Union Jack in the flag...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>yelled Jukes, so that every head on the Nan-Shan's decks
looked towards the bridge. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) sighed, and with sudden resignation:
<div class="bookquote">``It would certainly be a dam' distressful sight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said, meekly.

<p/>Later in the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) accosted the chief engineer with a confidential,
<div class="bookquote">``Here, let me tell you the old man's latest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the engineer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Solomon Rout -LRB-frequently alluded to as Long Sol, Old Sol, or Father
Rout-RRB-, from finding himself almost invariably the tallest man on board
every ship he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) joined, had acquired the habit of a stooping, leisurely
condescension. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair was scant and sandy, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flat cheeks were pale,
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bony wrists and long scholarly hands were pale, too, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had lived all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life in the shade.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled from on high at Jukes, and went on smoking and glancing about
quietly, in the manner of a kind uncle lending an ear to the tale of an
excited schoolboy. Then, greatly amused but impassive, he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) asked:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you throw up the billet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>cried Jukes, raising a weary, discouraged voice above the harsh
buzz of the Nan-Shan's friction winches. All of them were hard at work,
snatching slings of cargo, high up, to the end of long derricks, only,
as it seemed, to let them rip down recklessly by the run. The cargo
chains groaned in the gins, clinked on coamings, rattled over the
side; and the whole ship quivered, with her (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) long gray flanks smoking in
wreaths of steam. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>cried Jukes, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't. What's the good? I might
just as well fling my resignation at this bulkhead. I don't believe you
can make a man like that understand anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simply knocks me over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Captain MacWhirr, back from the shore, crossed the deck,
umbrella in hand, escorted by a mournful, self-possessed Chinaman,
walking behind in paper-soled silk shoes, and who also carried an
umbrella.

<p/>The master of the Nan-Shan, speaking just audibly and gazing at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
boots as his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) manner was, remarked that it would be necessary to call
at Fu-chau this trip, and desired Mr. Rout to have steam up to-morrow
afternoon at one oclock sharp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) pushed back his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) hat to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>)
forehead, observing at the same time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) hated going ashore
anyhow; while overtopping him (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) Mr. Rout, without deigning a word, smoked
austerely, nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) right elbow in the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) left hand.
Then Jukes was directed in the same subdued voice to keep the forward
`tween-deck clear of cargo. Two hundred coolies were going to be put
down there. The Bun Hin Company were sending that lot home. Twenty-five
bags of rice would be coming off in a sampan directly, for stores. All
seven-years'-men they were, said Captain MacWhirr, with a camphor-wood
chest to every man. The carpenter should be set to work nailing
three-inch battens along the deck below, fore and aft, to keep these
boxes from shifting in a sea-way. Jukes had better look to it at once.
<div class="bookquote">``Dye hear, Jukes?''  (<font color='red'><b>This chinaman</b></font>)</div>This chinaman here was coming with the ship as far
as Fu-chau--a sort of interpreter he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) would be. Bun Hin's clerk he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>)
was, and wanted to have a look at the space. Jukes had better take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
forward. <div class="bookquote">``Dye hear, Jukes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes took care to punctuate these instructions in proper places with
the obligatory <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>ejaculated without enthusiasm. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) brusque
<div class="bookquote">``Come along, John; make look see''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chinaman</b></font>)</div>set the Chinaman in motion at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
heels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wanchee look see, all same look see can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said Jukes, who having no
talent for foreign languages mangled the very pidgin-English cruelly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
pointed at the open hatch. <div class="bookquote">``Catchee number one piecie place to sleep in.
Eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was gruff, as became his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) racial superiority, but not unfriendly. The
Chinaman, gazing sad and speechless into the darkness of the hatchway,
seemed to stand at the head of a yawning grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No catchee rain down there--savee?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>pointed out Jukes. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose all'ee
same fine weather, one piecie coolie-man come topside,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) pursued,
warming up imaginatively. <div class="bookquote">``Make so--Phooooo!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) expanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) chest and
blew out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``Savee, John? Breathe--fresh air. Good. Eh? Washee
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) piecie pants, chow-chow top-side--see, John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) mouth and hands he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) made exuberant motions of eating rice and
washing clothes; and the Chinaman, who concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) distrust of this
pantomime under a collected demeanour tinged by a gentle and refined
melancholy, glanced out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) almond eyes from Jukes to the hatch and
back again. <div class="bookquote">``Velly good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) murmured, in a disconsolate undertone, and
hastened smoothly along the decks, dodging obstacles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) course. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
disappeared, ducking low under a sling of ten dirty gunny-bags full of
some costly merchandise and exhaling a repulsive smell.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr meantime had gone on the bridge, and into the
chart-room, where a letter, commenced two days before, awaited
termination. These long letters began with the words, <div class="bookquote">``My darling wife,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the steward</b></font>)</div>and the steward, between the scrubbing of the floors and the dusting
of chronometer-boxes, snatched at every opportunity to read them. They
interested him (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) much more than they possibly could the woman for whose
eye they were intended; and this for the reason that they related in
minute detail each successive trip of the Nan-Shan.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) master, faithful to facts, which alone his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) consciousness reflected,
would set them down with painstaking care upon many pages. The house
in a northern suburb to which these pages were addressed had a bit of
garden before the bow-windows, a deep porch of good appearance,
coloured glass with imitation lead frame in the front door. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) paid
five-and-forty pounds a year for it, and did not think the rent too
high, because Mrs. MacWhirr -LRB-a pretentious person with a scraggy
neck and a disdainful manner-RRB- was admittedly ladylike, and in the
neighbourhood considered as <div class="bookquote">``quite superior.''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>The only secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>)
life was her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) abject terror of the time when her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) husband would come home
to stay for good. Under the same roof there dwelt also a daughter called
Lydia and a son, Tom. These two were but slightly acquainted with their
father. Mainly, they knew him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as a rare but privileged visitor, who of
an evening smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) pipe in the dining-room and slept in the house.
The lanky girl, upon the whole, was rather ashamed of him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>); the boy
was frankly and utterly indifferent in a straightforward, delightful,
unaffected way manly boys have.

<p/>And Captain MacWhirr wrote home from the coast of China twelve times
every year, desiring quaintly to be <div class="bookquote">``remembered to the children,''  (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div>and
subscribing himself <div class="bookquote">``your loving husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div>as calmly as if the words so
long used by so many men were, apart from their shape, worn-out things,
and of a faded meaning.

<p/>The China seas north and south are narrow seas. They are seas full of
every-day, eloquent facts, such as islands, sand-banks, reefs, swift and
changeable currents--tangled facts that nevertheless speak to a seaman
in clear and definite language. Their speech appealed to Captain
MacWhirr's sense of realities so forcibly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had given up his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
state-room below and practically lived all his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) days on the bridge of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ship, often having his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) meals sent up, and sleeping at night in the
chart-room. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) indited there his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) home letters. Each of them, without
exception, contained the phrase, <div class="bookquote">``The weather has been very fine this
trip,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or some other form of a statement to that effect. And this
statement, too, in its wonderful persistence, was of the same perfect
accuracy as all the others they contained.

<p/>Mr. Rout likewise wrote letters; only no one on board knew how chatty he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>)
could be pen in hand, because the chief engineer had enough imagination
to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) desk locked. His (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) wife relished his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) style greatly. They were
a childless couple, and Mrs. Rout, a big, high-bosomed, jolly woman of
forty, shared with Mr. Rout's toothless and venerable mother a little
cottage near Teddington. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would run over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) correspondence, at
breakfast, with lively eyes, and scream out interesting passages in a
joyous voice at the deaf old lady, prefacing each extract by the
warning shout, <div class="bookquote">``Solomon says!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had the trick of firing off
Solomon's utterances also upon strangers, astonishing them easily by the
unfamiliar text and the unexpectedly jocular vein of these quotations.
On the day the new curate called for the first time at the cottage, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
found occasion to remark, <div class="bookquote">``As Solomon says: `the engineers that go down
to the sea in ships behold the wonders of sailor nature';''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when a change
in the visitor's countenance made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stop and stare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Solomon... Oh! ... Mrs. Rout,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>stuttered the young man, very red
in the face, <div class="bookquote">``I must say ... I don't...''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>)'s my husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) announced in a great shout, throwing herself
back in the chair. Perceiving the joke, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) laughed immoderately with a
handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat wearing a forced smile, and,
from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inexperience of jolly women, fully persuaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must
be deplorably insane. They were excellent friends afterwards; for,
absolving her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from irreverent intention, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a
very worthy person indeed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learned in time to receive without
flinching other scraps of Solomon's wisdom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon</b></font>)</div>Solomon was reported by his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) wife to have said once, <div class="bookquote">``give
me the dullest ass for a skipper before a rogue. There is a way to
take a fool; but a rogue is smart and slippery.''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>This was an airy
generalization drawn from the particular case of Captain MacWhirr's
honesty, which, in itself, had the heavy obviousness of a lump of clay.
On the other hand, Mr. Jukes, unable to generalize, unmarried, and
unengaged, was in the habit of opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) heart after another fashion
to an old chum and former shipmate, actually serving as second officer
on board an Atlantic liner.

<p/>First of all he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) would insist upon the advantages of the Eastern trade,
hinting at its superiority to the Western ocean service. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) extolled
the sky, the seas, the ships, and the easy life of the Far East. The
Nan-Shan, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) affirmed, was second to none as a sea-boat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have no brass-bound uniforms, but then we are like brothers here,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) wrote. ``We all mess together and live like fighting-cocks... All
the chaps of the black-squad are as decent as they make that kind, and
old Sol, the Chief, is a dry stick. We are good friends. As to our old
man, you could not find a quieter skipper. Sometimes you would think he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>)
hadn't sense enough to see anything wrong. And yet it isn't that. Can't
be. He (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) has been in command for a good few years now. He (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) doesn't do
anything actually foolish, and gets his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) ship along all right without
worrying anybody. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) hasn't brains enough to enjoy kicking
up a row. I don't take advantage of him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>). I would scorn it. Outside the
routine of duty he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) doesn't seem to understand more than half of what you
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>). We get a laugh out of this at times; but it is dull, too, to
be with a man like this--in the long-run. Old Sol says he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) hasn't much
conversation. Conversation! O Lord! He (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) never talks. The other day I had
been yarning under the bridge with one of the engineers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) must
have heard us. When I came up to take my watch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) steps out of the
chart-room and has a good look all round, peeps over at the sidelights,
glances at the compass, squints upward at the stars. That's his (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) regular
performance. By-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) says: `Was that you talking just now in the
port alleyway?' `Yes, sir.' `With the third engineer?' `Yes, sir.' He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>)
walks off to starboard, and sits under the dodger on a little campstool
of his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>), and for half an hour perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) makes no sound, except that I
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) sneeze once. Then after a while I hear him (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) getting up over
there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) strolls across to port, where I was. `I can't understand
what you can find to talk about,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>). `Two solid hours. I am not
blaming you. I see people ashore at it all day long, and then in the
evening they sit down and keep at it over the drinks. Must be saying the
same things over and over again. I can't understand.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever hear anything like that? And he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) was so patient about it.
It made me quite sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) is exasperating, too, sometimes.
Of course one would not do anything to vex him (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) even if it were worth
while. But it isn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>)'s so jolly innocent that if you were to put your
thumb to your nose and wave your fingers at him (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) would only wonder
gravely to himself what got into you. He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) told me once quite simply that
he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) found it very difficult to make out what made people always act so
queerly. He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>)'s too dense to trouble about, and that's the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus wrote Mr. Jukes to his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) chum in the Western ocean trade, out of the
fulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) heart and the liveliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) fancy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) honest opinion. It was not worthwhile trying to
impress a man of that sort. If the world had been full of such men, life
would have probably appeared to Jukes an unentertaining and unprofitable
business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was not alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) opinion. The sea itself, as if sharing
Mr. Jukes' good-natured forbearance, had never put itself out to startle
the silent man, who seldom looked up, and wandered innocently over
the waters with the only visible purpose of getting food, raiment,
and house-room for three people ashore. Dirty weather he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had known, of
course. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been made wet, uncomfortable, tired in the usual way,
felt at the time and presently forgotten. So that upon the whole he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
been justified in reporting fine weather at home. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been
given a glimpse of immeasurable strength and of immoderate wrath, the
wrath that passes exhausted but never appeased--the wrath and fury
of the passionate sea. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew it existed, as we know that crime and
abominations exist; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard of it as a peaceable citizen in a town
hears of battles, famines, and floods, and yet knows nothing of what
these things mean--though, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) may have been mixed up in a street
row, have gone without his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) dinner once, or been soaked to the skin in
a shower. Captain MacWhirr had sailed over the surface of the oceans as
some men go skimming over the years of existence to sink gently into
a placid grave, ignorant of life to the last, without ever having been
made to see all it may contain of perfidy, of violence, and of terror.
There are on sea and land such men thus fortunate--or thus disdained by
destiny or by the sea.



<p/>II

<p/>Observing the steady fall of the barometer, Captain MacWhirr thought,
<div class="bookquote">``There's some dirty weather knocking about.''  (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div>This is precisely what he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had had an experience of moderately dirty weather--the term
dirty as applied to the weather implying only moderate discomfort to the
seaman. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) been informed by an indisputable authority that the
end of the world was to be finally accomplished by a catastrophic
disturbance of the atmosphere, he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) would have assimilated the information
under the simple idea of dirty weather, and no other, because he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) had
no experience of cataclysms, and belief does not necessarily imply
comprehension. The wisdom of his (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) county had pronounced by means of an
Act of Parliament that before he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) could be considered as fit to take
charge of a ship he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) should be able to answer certain simple questions on
the subject of circular storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons;
and apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) had answered them, since he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) was now in command of the
Nan-Shan in the China seas during the season of typhoons. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>)
had answered he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) remembered nothing of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) was, however, conscious of
being made uncomfortable by the clammy heat. He (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) came out on the bridge,
and found no relief to this oppression. The air seemed thick. He (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) gasped
like a fish, and began to believe himself greatly out of sorts.

<p/>The Nan-Shan was ploughing a vanishing furrow upon the circle of the
sea that had the surface and the shimmer of an undulating piece of
gray silk. The sun, pale and without rays, poured down leaden heat in a
strangely indecisive light, and the Chinamen were lying prostrate about
the decks. Their bloodless, pinched, yellow faces were like the faces
of bilious invalids. Captain MacWhirr noticed two of them especially,
stretched out on their backs below the bridge. As soon as they had
closed their eyes they seemed dead. Three others, however, were
quarrelling barbarously away forward; and one big fellow, half naked,
with herculean shoulders, was hanging limply over a winch; another,
sitting on the deck, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knees up and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head drooping sideways in
a girlish attitude, was plaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pigtail with infinite languor
depicted in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) whole person and in the very movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fingers.
The smoke struggled with difficulty out of the funnel, and instead
of streaming away spread itself out like an infernal sort of cloud,
smelling of sulphur and raining soot all over the decks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the devil are you doing there, Mr. Jukes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>asked Captain MacWhirr.

<p/>This unusual form of address, though mumbled rather than spoken, caused
the body of Mr. Jukes to start as though it had been prodded under the
fifth rib. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had had a low bench brought on the bridge, and sitting on
it, with a length of rope curled about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) feet and a piece of canvas
stretched over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) knees, was pushing a sail-needle vigorously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
looked up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) surprise gave to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) eyes an expression of innocence
and candour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am only roping some of that new set of bags we made last trip for
whipping up coals,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) remonstrated, gently. <div class="bookquote">``We shall want them for the
next coaling, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What became of the others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, worn out of course, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain MacWhirr, after glaring down irresolutely at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) chief mate,
disclosed the gloomy and cynical conviction that more than half of them
had been lost overboard, <div class="bookquote">``if only the truth was known,''  (<font color='red'><b>chief mate</b></font>)</div>and retired
to the other end of the bridge. Jukes, exasperated by this unprovoked
attack, broke the needle at the second stitch, and dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) work got
up and cursed the heat in a violent undertone.

<p/>The propeller thumped, the three Chinamen forward had given up
squabbling very suddenly, and the one who had been plaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) tail
clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) legs and stared dejectedly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) knees. The lurid
sunshine cast faint and sickly shadows. The swell ran higher and swifter
every moment, and the ship lurched heavily in the smooth, deep hollows
of the sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder where that beastly swell comes from,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said Jukes aloud,
recovering himself after a stagger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``North-east,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>grunted the literal MacWhirr, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) side of the bridge.
<div class="bookquote">``There's some dirty weather knocking about. Go and look at the glass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>When Jukes came out of the chart-room, the cast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) countenance had
changed to thoughtfulness and concern. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) caught hold of the bridge-rail
and stared ahead.

<p/>The temperature in the engine-room had gone up to a hundred and
seventeen degrees. Irritated voices were ascending through the skylight
and through the fiddle of the stokehold in a harsh and resonant uproar,
mingled with angry clangs and scrapes of metal, as if men with limbs of
iron and throats of bronze had been quarrelling down there. The second
engineer was falling foul of the stokers for letting the steam go down.
He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) was a man with arms like a blacksmith, and generally feared; but that
afternoon the stokers were answering him (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) back recklessly, and slammed
the furnace doors with the fury of despair. Then the noise ceased
suddenly, and the second engineer appeared, emerging out of the
stokehold streaked with grime and soaking wet like a chimney-sweep
coming out of a well. As soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) head was clear of the fiddle he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>)
began to scold Jukes for not trimming properly the stokehold
ventilators; and in answer Jukes made with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) hands deprecatory
soothing signs meaning: <div class="bookquote">``No wind--can't be helped--you can see for
yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>But the other wouldn't hear reason. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) teeth flashed angrily
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) dirty face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) didn't mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said, the trouble of punching
their blanked heads down there, blank his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) soul, but did the condemned
sailors think you could keep steam up in the God-forsaken boilers simply
by knocking the blanked stokers about? No, by George! You had to get
some draught, too--may he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) be everlastingly blanked for a swab-headed
deck-hand if you didn't! And the chief, too, rampaging before the
steam-gauge and carrying on like a lunatic up and down the engine-room
ever since noon. What did Jukes think he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was stuck up there for, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
couldn't get one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) decayed, good-for-nothing deck-cripples to turn
the ventilators to the wind?

<p/>The relations of the <div class="bookquote">``engine-room''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``deck''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>of the Nan-Shan were,
as is known, of a brotherly nature; therefore Jukes leaned over and
begged the other in a restrained tone not to make a disgusting ass of
himself; the skipper was on the other side of the bridge. But the second
declared mutinously that he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) didn't care a rap who was on the other side
of the bridge, and Jukes, passing in a flash from lofty disapproval into
a state of exaltation, invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) in unflattering terms to come up and
twist the beastly things to please himself, and catch such wind as a
donkey of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) sort could find. The second rushed up to the fray. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
flung himself at the port ventilator as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) meant to tear it out
bodily and toss it overboard. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) did was to move the cowl round a
few inches, with an enormous expenditure of force, and seemed spent
in the effort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) leaned against the back of the wheelhouse, and Jukes
walked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>the engineer</b></font>)</div>ejaculated the engineer in a feeble voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) lifted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) eyes to the sky, and then let his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) glassy stare descend to meet the
horizon that, tilting up to an angle of forty degrees, seemed to hang on
a slant for a while and settled down slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Heavens! Phew! What's up,
anyhow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes, straddling his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) long legs like a pair of compasses, put on an
air of superiority. <div class="bookquote">``We're going to catch it this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The
barometer is tumbling down like anything, Harry. And you trying to kick
up that silly row...''

 (<font color='red'><b>the engineer</b></font>)</div><p/>The word <div class="bookquote">``barometer''  (<font color='red'><b>the engineer</b></font>)</div>seemed to revive the second engineer's mad
animosity. Collecting afresh all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) energies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) directed Jukes in a
low and brutal tone to shove the unmentionable instrument down his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
gory throat. Who cared for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) crimson barometer? It was the steam--the
steam--that was going down; and what between the firemen going faint and
the chief going silly, it was worse than a dog's life for him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) didn't
care a tinker's curse how soon the whole show was blown out of the
water. He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) seemed on the point of having a cry, but after regaining his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
breath he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) muttered darkly, <div class="bookquote">``I'll faint them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and dashed off. He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) stopped
upon the fiddle long enough to shake his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) fist at the unnatural daylight,
and dropped into the dark hole with a whoop.

<p/>When Jukes turned, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) eyes fell upon the rounded back and the big red
ears of Captain MacWhirr, who had come across. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did not look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
chief officer, but said at once, <div class="bookquote">``That's a very violent man, that second
engineer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>officer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jolly good second, anyhow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>grunted Jukes. <div class="bookquote">``They can't keep up steam,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) added, rapidly, and made a grab at the rail against the coming lurch.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr, unprepared, took a run and brought himself up with a
jerk by an awning stanchion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A profane man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) said, obstinately. <div class="bookquote">``If this goes on, I'll have to
get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the first chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the heat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said Jukes. <div class="bookquote">``The weather's awful. It would make a saint
swear. Even up here I feel exactly as if I had my head tied up in a
woollen blanket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain MacWhirr looked up. <div class="bookquote">``Dye mean to say, Mr. Jukes, you ever had
your head tied up in a blanket? What was that for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a manner of speaking, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said Jukes, stolidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some of you fellows do go on! What's that about saints swearing? I wish
you wouldn't talk so wild. What sort of saint would that be that would
swear? No more saint than yourself, I expect. And what's a blanket got
to do with it--or the weather either... The heat does not make me
swear--does it? It's filthy bad temper. That's what it is. And what's
the good of your talking like this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus Captain MacWhirr expostulated against the use of images in speech,
and at the end electrified Jukes by a contemptuous snort, followed by
words of passion and resentment: <div class="bookquote">``Damme! I'll fire him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) out of the ship
if he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) don't look out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>And Jukes, incorrigible, thought: <div class="bookquote">``Goodness me! Somebody's put a new
inside to my old man. Here's temper, if you like. Of course it's the
weather; what else? It would make an angel quarrelsome--let alone a
saint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>All the Chinamen on deck appeared at their last gasp.

<p/>At its setting the sun had a diminished diameter and an expiring brown,
rayless glow, as if millions of centuries elapsing since the morning
had brought it near its end. A dense bank of cloud became visible to the
northward; it had a sinister dark olive tint, and lay low and motionless
upon the sea, resembling a solid obstacle in the path of the ship. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
went floundering towards it like an exhausted creature driven to its
death. The coppery twilight retired slowly, and the darkness brought
out overhead a swarm of unsteady, big stars, that, as if blown upon,
flickered exceedingly and seemed to hang very near the earth. At eight
oclock Jukes went into the chart-room to write up the ship's log.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) copies neatly out of the rough-book the number of miles, the course
of the ship, and in the column for <div class="bookquote">``wind''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>scrawled the word <div class="bookquote">``calm''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>from
top to bottom of the eight hours since noon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was exasperated by the
continuous, monotonous rolling of the ship. The heavy inkstand would
slide away in a manner that suggested perverse intelligence in dodging
the pen. Having written in the large space under the head of <div class="bookquote">``Remarks''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Heat very oppressive,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) stuck the end of the penholder in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) teeth,
pipe fashion, and mopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) face carefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ship rolling heavily in a high cross swell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) began again, and
commented to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Heavily is no word for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) wrote:
<div class="bookquote">``Sunset threatening, with a low bank of clouds to N. and E. Sky clear
overhead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sprawling over the table with arrested pen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) glanced out of the door,
and in that frame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) vision he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) saw all the stars flying upwards
between the teakwood jambs on a black sky. The whole lot took flight
together and disappeared, leaving only a blackness flecked with white
flashes, for the sea was as black as the sky and speckled with foam
afar. The stars that had flown to the roll came back on the return swing
of the ship, rushing downwards in their glittering multitude, not of
fiery points, but enlarged to tiny discs brilliant with a clear wet
sheen.

<p/>Jukes watched the flying big stars for a moment, and then wrote: <div class="bookquote">``8 P.M.
Swell increasing. Ship labouring and taking water on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) decks. Battened
down the coolies for the night. Barometer still falling.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) paused, and
thought to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps nothing whatever'll come of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) closed resolutely his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) entries: <div class="bookquote">``Every appearance of a typhoon coming
on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On going out he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had to stand aside, and Captain MacWhirr strode over the
doorstep without saying a word or making a sign.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut the door, Mr. Jukes, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) cried from within.

<p/>Jukes turned back to do so, muttering ironically: <div class="bookquote">``Afraid to catch cold,
I suppose.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) watch below, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) yearned for communion with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) kind; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) remarked cheerily to the second mate: <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't look so
bad, after all--does it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div><p/>The second mate was marching to and fro on the bridge, tripping down
with small steps one moment, and the next climbing with difficulty the
shifting slope of the deck. At the sound of Jukes' voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) stood still,
facing forward, but made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo! That's a heavy one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said Jukes, swaying to meet the long roll
till his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) lowered hand touched the planks. This time the second mate made
in his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) throat a noise of an unfriendly nature.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) was an oldish, shabby little fellow, with bad teeth and no hair on
his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) had been shipped in a hurry in Shanghai, that trip when
the second officer brought from home had delayed the ship three hours
in port by contriving -LRB-in some manner Captain MacWhirr could never
understand-RRB- to fall overboard into an empty coal-lighter lying
alongside, and had to be sent ashore to the hospital with concussion of
the brain and a broken limb or two.

<p/>Jukes was not discouraged by the unsympathetic sound. <div class="bookquote">``The Chinamen must
be having a lovely time of it down there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's lucky for them
the old girl has the easiest roll of any ship I've ever been in. There
now! This one wasn't so bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div>snarled the second mate.

<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) sharp nose, red at the tip, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) thin pinched lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
always looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) were raging inwardly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was concise in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) speech to the point of rudeness. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) time off duty he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) spent
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) cabin with the door shut, keeping so still in there that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was
supposed to fall asleep as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had disappeared; but the man who
came in to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watch on deck would invariably find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes wide open, flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back in the bunk, and glaring irritably
from a soiled pillow. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never wrote any letters, did not seem to hope
for news from anywhere; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been heard once to mention
West Hartlepool, it was with extreme bitterness, and only in connection
with the extortionate charges of a boarding-house. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was one of those
men who are picked up at need in the ports of the world. They are
competent enough, appear hopelessly hard up, show no evidence of any
sort of vice, and carry about them all the signs of manifest failure.
They come aboard on an emergency, care for no ship afloat, live in their
own atmosphere of casual connection amongst their shipmates who know
nothing of them, and make up their minds to leave at inconvenient times.
They clear out with no words of leavetaking in some God-forsaken port
other men would fear to be stranded in, and go ashore in company of a
shabby sea-chest, corded like a treasure-box, and with an air of shaking
the ship's dust off their feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) repeated, balanced in great swings with his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) back to
Jukes, motionless and implacable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say we are going to catch it hot?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>asked Jukes with
boyish interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say? ... I say nothing. You don't catch me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div>snapped the little
second mate, with a mixture of pride, scorn, and cunning, as if Jukes'
question had been a trap cleverly detected. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! None of you here
shall make a fool of me if I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) mumbled to himself.

<p/>Jukes reflected rapidly that this second mate was a mean little beast,
and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) wished poor Jack Allen had never smashed himself up
in the coal-lighter. The far-off blackness ahead of the ship was like
another night seen through the starry night of the earth--the starless
night of the immensities beyond the created universe, revealed in its
appalling stillness through a low fissure in the glittering sphere of
which the earth is the kernel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever there might be about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said Jukes, <div class="bookquote">``we are steaming straight
into it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've said it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div>caught up the second mate, always with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) back to
Jukes. <div class="bookquote">``You've said it, mind--not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, go to Jericho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said Jukes, frankly; and the other emitted a
triumphant little chuckle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've said it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've known some real good men get into trouble with their skippers for
saying a dam' sight less,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div>answered the second mate feverishly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!
You don't catch me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem deucedly anxious not to give yourself away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said Jukes,
completely soured by such absurdity. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't be afraid to say what I
think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, to me! That's no great trick. I am nobody, and well I know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>The ship, after a pause of comparative steadiness, started upon a series
of rolls, one worse than the other, and for a time Jukes, preserving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) equilibrium, was too busy to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) mouth. As soon as the violent
swinging had quieted down somewhat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``This is a bit too much of
a good thing. Whether anything is coming or not I think she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ought to be
put head on to that swell. The old man is just gone in to lie down. Hang
me if I don't speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) opened the door of the chart-room he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) captain reading
a book. Captain MacWhirr was not lying down: he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was standing up with
one hand grasping the edge of the bookshelf and the other holding open
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) face a thick volume. The lamp wriggled in the gimbals,
the loosened books toppled from side to side on the shelf, the long
barometer swung in jerky circles, the table altered its slant every
moment. In the midst of all this stir and movement Captain MacWhirr,
holding on, showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes above the upper edge, and asked, <div class="bookquote">``What's the
matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Swell getting worse, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Noticed that in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>muttered Captain MacWhirr. <div class="bookquote">``Anything wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes, inwardly disconcerted by the seriousness of the eyes looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) over the top of the book, produced an embarrassed grin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rolling like old boots,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said, sheepishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye! Very heavy--very heavy. What do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>At this Jukes lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) footing and began to flounder. <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of
our passengers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said, in the manner of a man clutching at a straw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Passengers?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>wondered the Captain, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``What passengers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the Chinamen, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>explained Jukes, very sick of this
conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Chinamen! Why don't you speak plainly? Couldn't tell what you
meant. Never heard a lot of coolies spoken of as passengers before.
Passengers, indeed! What's come to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain MacWhirr, closing the book on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) forefinger, lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arm
and looked completely mystified. <div class="bookquote">``Why are you thinking of the Chinamen,
Mr. Jukes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) inquired.

<p/>Jukes took a plunge, like a man driven to it. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>)'s rolling her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) decks
full of water, sir. Thought you might put her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) head on perhaps--for a
while. Till this goes down a bit--very soon, I dare say. Head to the
eastward. I never knew a ship roll like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) held on in the doorway, and Captain MacWhirr, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) grip on
the shelf inadequate, made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mind to let go in a hurry, and fell
heavily on the couch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Head to the eastward?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, struggling to sit up. <div class="bookquote">``That's more than
four points off her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. Fifty degrees... Would just bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) head far enough
round to meet this...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain MacWhirr was now sitting up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had not dropped the book, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
had not lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the eastward?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) repeated, with dawning astonishment. <div class="bookquote">``To the ...
Where do you think we are bound to? You want me to haul a full-powered
steamship four points off her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) course to make the Chinamen comfortable!
Now, I've heard more than enough of mad things done in the world--but
this... If I didn't know you, Jukes, I would think you were in
liquor. Steer four points off... And what afterwards? Steer four
points over the other way, I suppose, to make the course good. What put
it into your head that I would start to tack a steamer as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) were a
sailing-ship?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jolly good thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>threw in Jukes, with bitter readiness.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) would have rolled every blessed stick out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye! And you just would have had to stand and see them go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said
Captain MacWhirr, showing a certain animation. <div class="bookquote">``It's a dead calm, isn't
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, sir. But there's something out of the common coming, for sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe. I suppose you have a notion I should be getting out of the
way of that dirt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain MacWhirr, speaking with the utmost
simplicity of manner and tone, and fixing the oilcloth on the floor
with a heavy stare. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) noticed neither Jukes' discomfiture nor the
mixture of vexation and astonished respect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, here's this book,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) continued with deliberation, slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
thigh with the closed volume. <div class="bookquote">``I've been reading the chapter on the
storms there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had been reading the chapter on the storms. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
had entered the chart-room, it was with no intention of taking the book
down. Some influence in the air--the same influence, probably, that
caused the steward to bring without orders the Captain's sea-boots and
oilskin coat up to the chart-room--had as it were guided his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand to
the shelf; and without taking the time to sit down he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had waded with a
conscious effort into the terminology of the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) lost himself
amongst advancing semi-circles, left- and right-hand quadrants, the
curves of the tracks, the probable bearing of the centre, the shifts of
wind and the readings of barometer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) tried to bring all these
things into a definite relation to himself, and ended by becoming
contemptuously angry with such a lot of words, and with so much advice,
all head-work and supposition, without a glimmer of certitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the damnedest thing, Jukes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If a fellow was to believe
all that's in there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) would be running most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) time all over the
sea trying to get behind the weather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) leg with the book; and Jukes opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) mouth, but
said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Running to get behind the weather! Do you understand that, Mr. Jukes?
It's the maddest thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Captain MacWhirr, with pauses,
gazing at the floor profoundly. <div class="bookquote">``You would think an old woman had been
writing this. It passes me. If that thing means anything useful, then
it means that I should at once alter the course away, away to the devil
somewhere, and come booming down on Fu-chau from the northward at the
tail of this dirty weather that's supposed to be knocking about in our
way. From the north! Do you understand, Mr. Jukes? Three hundred extra
miles to the distance, and a pretty coal bill to show. I couldn't bring
myself to do that if every word in there was gospel truth, Mr. Jukes.
Don't you expect me...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>And Jukes, silent, marvelled at this display of feeling and loquacity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the truth is that you don't know if the fellow is right, anyhow.
How can you tell what a gale is made of till you get it? He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) isn't aboard
here, is he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)? Very well. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) says that the centre of them things
bears eight points off the wind; but we haven't got any wind, for all
the barometer falling. Where's his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) centre now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will get the wind presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>mumbled Jukes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it come, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain MacWhirr, with dignified indignation.
<div class="bookquote">``It's only to let you see, Mr. Jukes, that you don't find everything in
books. All these rules for dodging breezes and circumventing the winds
of heaven, Mr. Jukes, seem to me the maddest thing, when you come to
look at it sensibly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) eyes, saw Jukes gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) dubiously, and tried to
illustrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) meaning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About as queer as your extraordinary notion of dodging the ship head
to sea, for I don't know how long, to make the Chinamen comfortable;
whereas all we've got to do is to take them to Fu-chau, being timed to
get there before noon on Friday. If the weather delays me--very well.
There's your log-book to talk straight about the weather. But suppose
I went swinging off my course and came in two days late, and they asked
me: `Where have you been all that time, Captain?' What could I say to
that? `Went around to dodge the bad weather,' I would say. `It must've
been dam' bad,' they would say. `Don't know,' I would have to say; `I've
dodged clear of it.' See that, Jukes? I have been thinking it all out
this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) looked up again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) unseeing, unimaginative way. No one had ever
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) say so much at one time. Jukes, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) arms open in the
doorway, was like a man invited to behold a miracle. Unbounded wonder
was the intellectual meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) eye, while incredulity was seated in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) whole countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A gale is a gale, Mr. Jukes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>resumed the Captain, <div class="bookquote">``and a full-powered
steam-ship has got to face it. There's just so much dirty weather
knocking about the world, and the proper thing is to go through it with
none of what old Captain Wilson of the Melita calls `storm strategy.'
The other day ashore I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hold forth about it to a lot of
shipmasters who came in and sat at a table next to mine. It seemed to me
the greatest nonsense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was telling them how he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) outmanoeuvred, I
think he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, a terrific gale, so that it never came nearer than fifty
miles to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). A neat piece of head-work he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) called it. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) knew there
was a terrific gale fifty miles off beats me altogether. It was like
listening to a crazy man. I would have thought Captain Wilson was old
enough to know better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain MacWhirr ceased for a moment, then said, <div class="bookquote">``It's your watch below,
Mr. Jukes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes came to himself with a start. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave orders to call me at the slightest change,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) reached up to put the book away, and tucked his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) legs upon the couch.
<div class="bookquote">``Shut the door so that it don't fly open, will you? I can't stand a
door banging. They've put a lot of rubbishy locks into this ship, I must
say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain MacWhirr closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did so to rest himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was tired, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) experienced that state
of mental vacuity which comes at the end of an exhaustive discussion
that has liberated some belief matured in the course of meditative
years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had indeed been making his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) confession of faith, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) only
known it; and its effect was to make Jukes, on the other side of the
door, stand scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) head for a good while.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) must have been asleep. What was that loud noise? Wind? Why
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) not been called? The lamp wriggled in its gimbals, the barometer
swung in circles, the table altered its slant every moment; a pair of
limp sea-boots with collapsed tops went sliding past the couch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) put
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand instantly, and captured one.

<p/>Jukes' face appeared in a crack of the door: only his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) face, very red,
with staring eyes. The flame of the lamp leaped, a piece of paper flew
up, a rush of air enveloped Captain MacWhirr. Beginning to draw on the
boot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) directed an expectant gaze at Jukes' swollen, excited features.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Came on like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>shouted Jukes, <div class="bookquote">``five minutes ago ... all of a
sudden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>The head disappeared with a bang, and a heavy splash and patter of drops
swept past the closed door as if a pailful of melted lead had been
flung against the house. A whistling could be heard now upon the
deep vibrating noise outside. The stuffy chart-room seemed as full of
draughts as a shed. Captain MacWhirr collared the other sea-boot on its
violent passage along the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was not flustered, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could not
find at once the opening for inserting his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) foot. The shoes he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had flung
off were scurrying from end to end of the cabin, gambolling playfully
over each other like puppies. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) stood up he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) kicked at them
viciously, but without effect.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) threw himself into the attitude of a lunging fencer, to reach after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) oilskin coat; and afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) staggered all over the confined
space while he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) jerked himself into it. Very grave, straddling his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) legs
far apart, and stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) neck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) started to tie deliberately
the strings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sou'-wester under his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) chin, with thick fingers that
trembled slightly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) went through all the movements of a woman putting
on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bonnet before a glass, with a strained, listening attention, as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had expected every moment to hear the shout of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) name in the
confused clamour that had suddenly beset his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ship. Its increase filled
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ears while he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was getting ready to go out and confront whatever it
might mean. It was tumultuous and very loud--made up of the rush of the
wind, the crashes of the sea, with that prolonged deep vibration of the
air, like the roll of an immense and remote drum beating the charge of
the gale.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) stood for a moment in the light of the lamp, thick, clumsy, shapeless
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) panoply of combat, vigilant and red-faced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a lot of weight in this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) muttered.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) attempted to open the door the wind caught it. Clinging
to the handle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was dragged out over the doorstep, and at once found
himself engaged with the wind in a sort of personal scuffle whose
object was the shutting of that door. At the last moment a tongue of air
scurried in and licked out the flame of the lamp.

<p/>Ahead of the ship he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) perceived a great darkness lying upon a multitude
of white flashes; on the starboard beam a few amazing stars drooped, dim
and fitful, above an immense waste of broken seas, as if seen through a
mad drift of smoke.

<p/>On the bridge a knot of men, indistinct and toiling, were making great
efforts in the light of the wheelhouse windows that shone mistily on
their heads and backs. Suddenly darkness closed upon one pane, then on
another. The voices of the lost group reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) after the manner of
men's voices in a gale, in shreds and fragments of forlorn shouting
snatched past the ear. All at once Jukes appeared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) side, yelling,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) head down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Watch--put in--wheelhouse shutters--glass--afraid--blow in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) commander upbraiding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This--come--anything--warning--call me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) tried to explain, with the uproar pressing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Light air--remained--bridge--sudden--north-east--could
turn--thought--you--sure--hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>They had gained the shelter of the weather-cloth, and could converse
with raised voices, as people quarrel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got the hands along to cover up all the ventilators. Good job I had
remained on deck. I didn't think you would be asleep, and so ... What
did you say, sir? What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>cried Captain MacWhirr. <div class="bookquote">``I said--all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all the powers! We've got it this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>observed Jukes in a howl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't altered her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) course?''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>inquired Captain MacWhirr, straining
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir. Certainly not. Wind came out right ahead. And here comes the
head sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A plunge of the ship ended in a shock as if she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) had landed her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) forefoot
upon something solid. After a moment of stillness a lofty flight of
sprays drove hard with the wind upon their faces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at it as long as we can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>shouted Captain MacWhirr.

<p/>Before Jukes had squeezed the salt water out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) eyes all the stars
had disappeared.



<p/>III

<p/>Jukes was as ready a man as any half-dozen young mates that may be
caught by casting a net upon the waters; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been somewhat
taken aback by the startling viciousness of the first squall, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
pulled himself together on the instant, had called out the hands and had
rushed them along to secure such openings about the deck as had not been
already battened down earlier in the evening. Shouting in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fresh,
stentorian voice, <div class="bookquote">``Jump, boys, and bear a hand!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) led in the work,
telling himself the while that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``just expected this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was growing aware that this was rather more than
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had expected. From the first stir of the air felt on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheek the
gale seemed to take upon itself the accumulated impetus of an avalanche.
Heavy sprays enveloped the Nan-Shan from stem to stern, and instantly in
the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) regular rolling she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) began to jerk and plunge as though
she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had gone mad with fright.

<p/>Jukes thought, <div class="bookquote">``This is no joke.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was exchanging explanatory
yells with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) captain, a sudden lowering of the darkness came upon the
night, falling before their vision like something palpable. It was as
if the masked lights of the world had been turned down. Jukes was
uncritically glad to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) captain at hand. It relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) as though
that man had, by simply coming on deck, taken most of the gale's weight
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders. Such is the prestige, the privilege, and the burden
of command.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr could expect no relief of that sort from any one on
earth. Such is the loneliness of command. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was trying to see, with
that watchful manner of a seaman who stares into the wind's eye as if
into the eye of an adversary, to penetrate the hidden intention and
guess the aim and force of the thrust. The strong wind swept at him (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) out
of a vast obscurity; he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) felt under his (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) feet the uneasiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) ship,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) could not even discern the shadow of her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) shape. He (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) wished it
were not so; and very still he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) waited, feeling stricken by a blind man's
helplessness.

<p/>To be silent was natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>), dark or shine. Jukes, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) elbow,
made himself heard yelling cheerily in the gusts, <div class="bookquote">``We must have got
the worst of it at once, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>A faint burst of lightning quivered all
round, as if flashed into a cavern--into a black and secret chamber of
the sea, with a floor of foaming crests.

<p/>It unveiled for a sinister, fluttering moment a ragged mass of clouds
hanging low, the lurch of the long outlines of the ship, the black
figures of men caught on the bridge, heads forward, as if petrified in
the act of butting. The darkness palpitated down upon all this, and then
the real thing came at last.

<p/>It was something formidable and swift, like the sudden smashing of
a vial of wrath. It seemed to explode all round the ship with an
overpowering concussion and a rush of great waters, as if an immense dam
had been blown up to windward. In an instant the men lost touch of each
other. This is the disintegrating power of a great wind: it isolates one
from one's kind. An earthquake, a landslip, an avalanche, overtake a man
incidentally, as it were--without passion. A furious gale attacks him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
like a personal enemy, tries to grasp his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) limbs, fastens upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind,
seeks to rout his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very spirit out of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Jukes was driven away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) commander. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) fancied himself whirled a
great distance through the air. Everything disappeared--even, for
a moment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) power of thinking; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) hand had found one of
the rail-stanchions. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) distress was by no means alleviated by an
inclination to disbelieve the reality of this experience. Though young,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had seen some bad weather, and had never doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) ability to
imagine the worst; but this was so much beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) powers of fancy that
it appeared incompatible with the existence of any ship whatever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
would have been incredulous about himself in the same way, perhaps, had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) not been so harassed by the necessity of exerting a wrestling effort
against a force trying to tear him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) hold. Moreover, the
conviction of not being utterly destroyed returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) through the
sensations of being half-drowned, bestially shaken, and partly choked.

<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) remained there precariously alone with the stanchion
for a long, long time. The rain poured on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>), flowed, drove in sheets.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) breathed in gasps; and sometimes the water he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) swallowed was fresh and
sometimes it was salt. For the most part he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) eyes shut tight, as
if suspecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) sight might be destroyed in the immense flurry of
the elements. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) ventured to blink hastily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) derived some moral
support from the green gleam of the starboard light shining feebly upon
the flight of rain and sprays. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was actually looking at it when its
ray fell upon the uprearing sea which put it out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) saw the head of the
wave topple over, adding the mite of its crash to the tremendous uproar
raging around him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>), and almost at the same instant the stanchion was
wrenched away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) embracing arms. After a crushing thump on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
back he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) found himself suddenly afloat and borne upwards. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) first
irresistible notion was that the whole China Sea had climbed on the
bridge. Then, more sanely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) concluded himself gone overboard. All the
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was being tossed, flung, and rolled in great volumes of water,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) kept on repeating mentally, with the utmost precipitation, the words:
<div class="bookquote">``My God! My God! My God! My God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>All at once, in a revolt of misery and despair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) formed the crazy
resolution to get out of that. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) began to thresh about with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
arms and legs. But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) commenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) wretched struggles he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
discovered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had become somehow mixed up with a face, an oilskin
coat, somebody's boots. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) clawed ferociously all these things in
turn, lost them, found them again, lost them once more, and finally was
himself caught in the firm clasp of a pair of stout arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) returned
the embrace closely round a thick solid body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had found his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) captain.

<p/>They tumbled over and over, tightening their hug. Suddenly the water
let them down with a brutal bang; and, stranded against the side of the
wheelhouse, out of breath and bruised, they were left to stagger up in
the wind and hold on where they could.

<p/>Jukes came out of it rather horrified, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had escaped some
unparalleled outrage directed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) feelings. It weakened his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) faith in
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) started shouting aimlessly to the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) could feel near him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
in that fiendish blackness, <div class="bookquote">``Is it you, sir? Is it you, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>till his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
temples seemed ready to burst. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) heard in answer a voice, as if
crying far away, as if screaming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) fretfully from a very great
distance, the one word <div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Other seas swept again over the bridge.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) received them defencelessly right over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) bare head, with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
hands engaged in holding.

<p/>The motion of the ship was extravagant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) lurches had an appalling
helplessness: she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) pitched as if taking a header into a void, and seemed
to find a wall to hit every time. When she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) rolled she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) side
headlong, and she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) would be righted back by such a demolishing blow that
Jukes felt her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) reeling as a clubbed man reels before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) collapses. The
gale howled and scuffled about gigantically in the darkness, as though
the entire world were one black gully. At certain moments the air
streamed against the ship as if sucked through a tunnel with a
concentrated solid force of impact that seemed to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) clean out
of the water and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) up for an instant with only a quiver running
through her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) from end to end. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) would begin her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) tumbling again
as if dropped back into a boiling cauldron. Jukes tried hard to compose
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) mind and judge things coolly.

<p/>The sea, flattened down in the heavier gusts, would uprise and overwhelm
both ends of the Nan-Shan in snowy rushes of foam, expanding wide,
beyond both rails, into the night. And on this dazzling sheet, spread
under the blackness of the clouds and emitting a bluish glow, Captain
MacWhirr could catch a desolate glimpse of a few tiny specks black as
ebony, the tops of the hatches, the battened companions, the heads of
the covered winches, the foot of a mast. This was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could see of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ship. Her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) middle structure, covered by the bridge which bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>),
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mate, the closed wheelhouse where a man was steering shut up with
the fear of being swept overboard together with the whole thing in one
great crash--her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) middle structure was like a half-tide rock awash upon a
coast. It was like an outlying rock with the water boiling up, streaming
over, pouring off, beating round--like a rock in the surf to which
shipwrecked people cling before they let go--only it rose, it sank, it
rolled continuously, without respite and rest, like a rock that should
have miraculously struck adrift from a coast and gone wallowing upon the
sea.

<p/>The Nan-Shan was being looted by the storm with a senseless, destructive
fury: trysails torn out of the extra gaskets, double-lashed awnings
blown away, bridge swept clean, weather-cloths burst, rails twisted,
light-screens smashed--and two of the boats had gone already. They had
gone unheard and unseen, melting, as it were, in the shock and smother
of the wave. It was only later, when upon the white flash of another
high sea hurling itself amidships, Jukes had a vision of two pairs of
davits leaping black and empty out of the solid blackness, with one
overhauled fall flying and an iron-bound block capering in the air, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) became aware of what had happened within about three yards of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
back.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) poked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) head forward, groping for the ear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) commander. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
lips touched it--big, fleshy, very wet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) cried in an agitated tone,
<div class="bookquote">``Our boats are going now, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>And again he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) heard that voice, forced and ringing feebly, but with a
penetrating effect of quietness in the enormous discord of noises, as if
sent out from some remote spot of peace beyond the black wastes of the
gale; again he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) heard a man's voice--the frail and indomitable sound that
can be made to carry an infinity of thought, resolution and purpose,
that shall be pronouncing confident words on the last day, when heavens
fall, and justice is done--again he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) heard it, and it was crying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>),
as if from very, very far--<div class="bookquote">``All right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had not managed to make himself understood. <div class="bookquote">``Our boats--I
say boats--the boats, sir! Two gone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The same voice, within a foot of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) and yet so remote, yelled sensibly,
<div class="bookquote">``Can't be helped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain MacWhirr had never turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) face, but Jukes caught some more
words on the wind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can--expect--when hammering through--such--Bound to
leave--something behind--stands to reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Watchfully Jukes listened for more. No more came. This was all Captain
MacWhirr had to say; and Jukes could picture to himself rather than see
the broad squat back before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>). An impenetrable obscurity pressed down
upon the ghostly glimmers of the sea. A dull conviction seized upon
Jukes that there was nothing to be done.

<p/>If the steering-gear did not give way, if the immense volumes of water
did not burst the deck in or smash one of the hatches, if the engines
did not give up, if way could be kept on the ship against this terrific
wind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) did not bury herself in one of these awful seas, of whose
white crests alone, topping high above her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) bows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) could now and then
get a sickening glimpse--then there was a chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) coming out of
it. Something within him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) seemed to turn over, bringing uppermost the
feeling that the Nan-Shan was lost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>)'s done for,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said to himself, with a surprising mental
agitation, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had discovered an unexpected meaning in this
thought. One of these things was bound to happen. Nothing could be
prevented now, and nothing could be remedied. The men on board did not
count, and the ship could not last. This weather was too impossible.

<p/>Jukes felt an arm thrown heavily over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) shoulders; and to this
overture he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) responded with great intelligence by catching hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
captain round the waist.

<p/>They stood clasped thus in the blind night, bracing each other against
the wind, cheek to cheek and lip to ear, in the manner of two hulks
lashed stem to stern together.

<p/>And Jukes heard the voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) commander hardly any louder than
before, but nearer, as though, starting to march athwart the prodigious
rush of the hurricane, it had approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>), bearing that strange
effect of quietness like the serene glow of a halo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dye know where the hands got to?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>it asked, vigorous and evanescent at
the same time, overcoming the strength of the wind, and swept away from
Jukes instantly.

<p/>Jukes didn't know. They were all on the bridge when the real force of
the hurricane struck the ship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had no idea where they had crawled to.
Under the circumstances they were nowhere, for all the use that could be
made of them. Somehow the Captain's wish to know distressed Jukes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Want the hands, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) cried, apprehensively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ought to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>asserted Captain MacWhirr. <div class="bookquote">``Hold hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They held hard. An outburst of unchained fury, a vicious rush of the
wind absolutely steadied the ship; she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) rocked only, quick and light like
a child's cradle, for a terrific moment of suspense, while the whole
atmosphere, as it seemed, streamed furiously past her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>), roaring away from
the tenebrous earth.

<p/>It suffocated them, and with eyes shut they tightened their grasp.
What from the magnitude of the shock might have been a column of water
running upright in the dark, butted against the ship, broke short,
and fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) bridge, crushingly, from on high, with a dead burying
weight.

<p/>A flying fragment of that collapse, a mere splash, enveloped them in one
swirl from their feet over their heads, filling violently their ears,
mouths and nostrils with salt water. It knocked out their legs, wrenched
in haste at their arms, seethed away swiftly under their chins; and
opening their eyes, they saw the piled-up masses of foam dashing to and
fro amongst what looked like the fragments of a ship. She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) had given way
as if driven straight in. Their panting hearts yielded, too, before the
tremendous blow; and all at once she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) sprang up again to her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) desperate
plunging, as if trying to scramble out from under the ruins.

<p/>The seas in the dark seemed to rush from all sides to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) back
where she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) might perish. There was hate in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) was handled, and
a ferocity in the blows that fell. She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) was like a living creature thrown
to the rage of a mob: hustled terribly, struck at, borne up, flung
down, leaped upon. Captain MacWhirr and Jukes kept hold of each other,
deafened by the noise, gagged by the wind; and the great physical
tumult beating about their bodies, brought, like an unbridled display
of passion, a profound trouble to their souls. One of those wild and
appalling shrieks that are heard at times passing mysteriously overhead
in the steady roar of a hurricane, swooped, as if borne on wings, upon
the ship, and Jukes tried to outscream it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>) live through this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The cry was wrenched out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) breast. It was as unintentional as the
birth of a thought in the head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) heard nothing of it himself. It
all became extinct at once--thought, intention, effort--and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) cry
the inaudible vibration added to the tempest waves of the air.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) expected nothing from it. Nothing at all. For indeed what answer
could be made? But after a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) heard with amazement the frail and
resisting voice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) ear, the dwarf sound, unconquered in the giant
tumult.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>) may!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a dull yell, more difficult to seize than a whisper. And
presently the voice returned again, half submerged in the vast crashes,
like a ship battling against the waves of an ocean.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's hope so!''  (<font color='red'><b>a stranger</b></font>)</div>it cried--small, lonely and unmoved, a stranger to
the visions of hope or fear; and it flickered into disconnected words:
<div class="bookquote">``Ship... This... Never--Anyhow ... for the best.''  (<font color='red'><b>a stranger</b></font>)</div>Jukes gave
it up.

<p/>Then, as if it had come suddenly upon the one thing fit to withstand
the power of a storm, it seemed to gain force and firmness for the last
broken shouts:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep on hammering ... builders ... good men... And chance it
... engines... Rout ... good man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain MacWhirr removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arm from Jukes' shoulders, and thereby
ceased to exist for his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mate, so dark it was; Jukes, after a tense
stiffening of every muscle, would let himself go limp all over. The
gnawing of profound discomfort existed side by side with an incredible
disposition to somnolence, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had been buffeted and worried
into drowsiness. The wind would get hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) head and try to shake
it off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) shoulders; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) clothes, full of water, were as heavy as lead,
cold and dripping like an armour of melting ice: he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) shivered--it lasted
a long time; and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) hands closed hard on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) hold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was letting
himself sink slowly into the depths of bodily misery. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) mind became
concentrated upon himself in an aimless, idle way, and when something
pushed lightly at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) knees he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) nearly, as the saying is,
jumped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) skin.

<p/>In the start forward he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) bumped the back of Captain MacWhirr, who didn't
move; and then a hand gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) thigh. A lull had come, a menacing
lull of the wind, the holding of a stormy breath--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) felt himself
pawed all over. It was the boatswain. Jukes recognized these hands, so
thick and enormous that they seemed to belong to some new species of
man.

<p/>The boatswain had arrived on the bridge, crawling on all fours against
the wind, and had found the chief mate's legs with the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) head.
Immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) crouched and began to explore Jukes' person upwards with
prudent, apologetic touches, as became an inferior.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was an ill-favoured, undersized, gruff sailor of fifty, coarsely
hairy, short-legged, long-armed, resembling an elderly ape. His (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>)
strength was immense; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) great lumpy paws, bulging like brown
boxing-gloves on the end of furry forearms, the heaviest objects were
handled like playthings. Apart from the grizzled pelt on his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) chest, the
menacing demeanour and the hoarse voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) had none of the classical
attributes of his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) rating. His (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) good nature almost amounted to imbecility:
the men did what they liked with him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) had not an ounce of
initiative in his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) character, which was easy-going and talkative. For
these reasons Jukes disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>); but Captain MacWhirr, to Jukes'
scornful disgust, seemed to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) as a first-rate petty officer.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) pulled himself up by Jukes' coat, taking that liberty with the
greatest moderation, and only so far as it was forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) by the
hurricane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, bossn, what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>yelled Jukes, impatiently. What could
that fraud of a bossn want on the bridge? The typhoon had got on Jukes'
nerves. The husky bellowings of the other, though unintelligible, seemed
to suggest a state of lively satisfaction.

<p/>There could be no mistake. The old fool was pleased with something.

<p/>The boatswain's other hand had found some other body, for in a changed
tone he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) began to inquire: <div class="bookquote">``Is it you, sir? Is it you, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The wind
strangled his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) howls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>cried Captain MacWhirr.



<p/>IV

<p/>All that the boatswain, out of a superabundance of yells, could make
clear to Captain MacWhirr was the bizarre intelligence that <div class="bookquote">``All them
Chinamen in the fore `tween deck have fetched away, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes to leeward could hear these two shouting within six inches of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) face, as you may hear on a still night half a mile away two men
conversing across a field. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) heard Captain MacWhirr's exasperated
<div class="bookquote">``What? What?''  (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div>and the strained pitch of the other's hoarseness. <div class="bookquote">``In a
lump ... seen them myself... Awful sight, sir ... thought ...
tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes remained indifferent, as if rendered irresponsible by the force
of the hurricane, which made the very thought of action utterly vain.
Besides, being very young, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had found the occupation of keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
heart completely steeled against the worst so engrossing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had
come to feel an overpowering dislike towards any other form of activity
whatever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was not scared; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) knew this because, firmly believing he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
would never see another sunrise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) remained calm in that belief.

<p/>These are the moments of do-nothing heroics to which even good men
surrender at times. Many officers of ships can no doubt recall a case
in their experience when just such a trance of confounded stoicism would
come all at once over a whole ship's company. Jukes, however, had
no wide experience of men or storms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) conceived himself to be
calm--inexorably calm; but as a matter of fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was daunted; not
abjectly, but only so far as a decent man may, without becoming
loathsome to himself.

<p/>It was rather like a forced-on numbness of spirit. The long, long
stress of a gale does it; the suspense of the interminably culminating
catastrophe; and there is a bodily fatigue in the mere holding on to
existence within the excessive tumult; a searching and insidious fatigue
that penetrates deep into a man's breast to cast down and sadden his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
heart, which is incorrigible, and of all the gifts of the earth--even
before life itself--aspires to peace.

<p/>Jukes was benumbed much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) supposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) held on--very wet,
very cold, stiff in every limb; and in a momentary hallucination of
swift visions -LRB-it is said that a drowning man thus reviews all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life-RRB-
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beheld all sorts of memories altogether unconnected with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present
situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, for instance: a worthy business
man, who at an unfortunate crisis in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affairs went quietly to bed
and died forthwith in a state of resignation. Jukes did not recall these
circumstances, of course, but remaining otherwise unconcerned he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) seemed
to see distinctly the poor man's face; a certain game of nap played when
quite a boy in Table Bay on board a ship, since lost with all hands;
the thick eyebrows of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) first skipper; and without any emotion, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might years ago have walked listlessly into her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) room and found her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
sitting there with a book, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother--dead, too, now--the
resolute woman, left badly off, who had been very firm in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bringing
up.

<p/>It could not have lasted more than a second, perhaps not so much. A
heavy arm had fallen about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shoulders; Captain MacWhirr's voice was
speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jukes! Jukes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) detected the tone of deep concern. The wind had thrown its weight
on the ship, trying to pin her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) down amongst the seas. They made a clean
breach over her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>), as over a deep-swimming log; and the gathered weight
of crashes menaced monstrously from afar. The breakers flung out of the
night with a ghostly light on their crests--the light of sea-foam that
in a ferocious, boiling-up pale flash showed upon the slender body of
the ship the toppling rush, the downfall, and the seething mad scurry
of each wave. Never for a moment could she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) shake herself clear of
the water; Jukes, rigid, perceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) motion the ominous sign of
haphazard floundering. She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) was no longer struggling intelligently. It
was the beginning of the end; and the note of busy concern in Captain
MacWhirr's voice sickened him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) like an exhibition of blind and pernicious
folly.

<p/>The spell of the storm had fallen upon Jukes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was penetrated by it,
absorbed by it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was rooted in it with a rigour of dumb attention.
Captain MacWhirr persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) cries, but the wind got between them
like a solid wedge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hung round Jukes' neck as heavy as a millstone,
and suddenly the sides of their heads knocked together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jukes! Mr. Jukes, I say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had to answer that voice that would not be silenced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) answered in
the customary manner: <div class="bookquote">``... Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>And directly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) heart, corrupted by the storm that breeds a craving
for peace, rebelled against the tyranny of training and command.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr had his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mate's head fixed firm in the crook of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
elbow, and pressed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) yelling lips mysteriously. Sometimes
Jukes would break in, admonishing hastily: <div class="bookquote">``Look out, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>or Captain
MacWhirr would bawl an earnest exhortation to <div class="bookquote">``Hold hard, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div>and
the whole black universe seemed to reel together with the ship. They
paused. She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) floated yet. And Captain MacWhirr would resume, his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) shouts.
<div class="bookquote">``... Says ... whole lot ... fetched away... Ought to see
... what's the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Directly the full force of the hurricane had struck the ship, every part
of her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) deck became untenable; and the sailors, dazed and dismayed, took
shelter in the port alleyway under the bridge. It had a door aft, which
they shut; it was very black, cold, and dismal. At each heavy fling of
the ship they would groan all together in the dark, and tons of water
could be heard scuttling about as if trying to get at them from above.
The boatswain had been keeping up a gruff talk, but a more unreasonable
lot of men, he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had never been with. They were snug
enough there, out of harm's way, and not wanted to do anything, either;
and yet they did nothing but grumble and complain peevishly like so many
sick kids. Finally, one of them said that if there had been at least
some light to see each other's noses by, it wouldn't be so bad. It was
making him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) crazy, he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) declared, to lie there in the dark waiting for the
blamed hooker to sink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you step outside, then, and be done with it at once?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boatswain</b></font>)</div>the
boatswain turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>).

<p/>This called up a shout of execration. The boatswain found himself
overwhelmed with reproaches of all sorts. They seemed to take it ill
that a lamp was not instantly created for them out of nothing. They
would whine after a light to get drowned by--anyhow! And though the
unreason of their revilings was patent--since no one could hope to reach
the lamp-room, which was forward--he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) became greatly distressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) did
not think it was decent of them to be nagging at him (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) like this. He (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) told
them so, and was met by general contumely. He (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) sought refuge, therefore,
in an embittered silence. At the same time their grumbling and sighing
and muttering worried him (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) greatly, but by-and-by it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) that
there were six globe lamps hung in the `tween-deck, and that there could
be no harm in depriving the coolies of one of them.

<p/>The Nan-Shan had an athwartship coal-bunker, which, being at times used
as cargo space, communicated by an iron door with the fore `tween-deck.
It was empty then, and its manhole was the foremost one in the alleyway.
The boatswain could get in, therefore, without coming out on deck at
all; but to his (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) great surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) could induce no one to help
him (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) in taking off the manhole cover. He (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) groped for it all the same, but
one of the crew lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) way refused to budge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I only want to get you that blamed light you are crying for,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>)
expostulated, almost pitifully.

<p/>Somebody told him (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) to go and put his (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) head in a bag. He (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) regretted he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) could
not recognize the voice, and that it was too dark to see, otherwise,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) would have put a head on that son of a sea-cook, anyway,
sink or swim. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) mind to show them he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>)
could get a light, if he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) were to die for it.

<p/>Through the violence of the ship's rolling, every movement was
dangerous. To be lying down seemed labour enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) nearly broke
his (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) neck dropping into the bunker. He (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) back, and was sent
shooting helplessly from side to side in the dangerous company of a
heavy iron bar--a coal-trimmer's slice probably--left down there by
somebody. This thing made him (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) as nervous as though it had been a
wild beast. He (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) could not see it, the inside of the bunker coated with
coal-dust being perfectly and impenetrably black; but he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) heard it
sliding and clattering, and striking here and there, always in the
neighbourhood of his (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) head. It seemed to make an extraordinary noise,
too--to give heavy thumps as though it had been as big as a bridge
girder. This was remarkable enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) to notice while he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) was flung
from port to starboard and back again, and clawing desperately the
smooth sides of the bunker in the endeavour to stop himself. The door
into the `tween-deck not fitting quite true, he (<font color='blue'><b>hooker</b></font>) saw a thread of dim
light at the bottom.

<p/>Being a sailor, and a still active man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not want much of a chance
to regain his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet; and as luck would have it, in scrambling up he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on the iron slice, picking it up as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose. Otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
have been afraid of the thing breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs, or at least knocking
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down again. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood still. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt unsafe in this darkness
that seemed to make the ship's motion unfamiliar, unforeseen, and
difficult to counteract. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt so much shaken for a moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
dared not move for fear of <div class="bookquote">``taking charge again.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no mind to get
battered to pieces in that bunker.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had struck his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head twice; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dazed a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to hear
yet so plainly the clatter and bangs of the iron slice flying about
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tightened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grip to prove to himself he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had it there
safely in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was vaguely amazed at the plainness with which
down there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear the gale raging. Its howls and shrieks seemed
to take on, in the emptiness of the bunker, something of the human
character, of human rage and pain--being not vast but infinitely
poignant. And there were, with every roll, thumps, too--profound,
ponderous thumps, as if a bulky object of five-ton weight or so had got
play in the hold. But there was no such thing in the cargo. Something on
deck? Impossible. Or alongside? Couldn't be.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thought all this quickly, clearly, competently, like a seaman, and
in the end remained puzzled. This noise, though, came deadened from
outside, together with the washing and pouring of water on deck above
his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) head. Was it the wind? Must be. It made down there a row like the
shouting of a big lot of crazed men. And he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) discovered in himself
a desire for a light, too--if only to get drowned by--and a nervous
anxiety to get out of that bunker as quickly as possible.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) pulled back the bolt: the heavy iron plate turned on its hinges; and
it was as though he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had opened the door to the sounds of the tempest.
A gust of hoarse yelling met him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>): the air was still; and the rushing
of water overhead was covered by a tumult of strangled, throaty shrieks
that produced an effect of desperate confusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) straddled his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) legs
the whole width of the doorway and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) neck. And at first
he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) perceived only what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had come to seek: six small yellow flames
swinging violently on the great body of the dusk.

<p/>It was stayed like the gallery of a mine, with a row of stanchions
in the middle, and cross-beams overhead, penetrating into the gloom
ahead--indefinitely. And to port there loomed, like the caving in of
one of the sides, a bulky mass with a slanting outline. The whole place,
with the shadows and the shapes, moved all the time. The boatswain
glared: the ship lurched to starboard, and a great howl came from that
mass that had the slant of fallen earth.

<p/>Pieces of wood whizzed past. Planks, he (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) thought, inexpressibly startled,
and flinging back his (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) head. At his (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) feet a man went sliding over,
open-eyed, on his (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) back, straining with uplifted arms for nothing: and
another came bounding like a detached stone with his (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) head between his (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>)
legs and his (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) hands clenched. His (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) pigtail whipped in the air; he (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) made a
grab at the boatswain's legs, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) opened hand a bright white
disc rolled against the boatswain's foot. He (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) recognized a silver dollar,
and yelled at it with astonishment. With a precipitated sound of
trampling and shuffling of bare feet, and with guttural cries, the mound
of writhing bodies piled up to port detached itself from the ship's side
and sliding, inert and struggling, shifted to starboard, with a dull,
brutal thump. The cries ceased. The boatswain heard a long moan through
the roar and whistling of the wind; he (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) saw an inextricable confusion of
heads and shoulders, naked soles kicking upwards, fists raised, tumbling
backs, legs, pigtails, faces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) cried, horrified, and banged-to the iron door upon this
vision.

<p/>This was what he (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) had come on the bridge to tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>boatswain</b></font>) could not keep it
to himself; and on board ship there is only one man to whom it is
worth while to unburden yourself. On his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passage back the hands in the
alleyway swore at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a fool. Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bring that lamp? What
the devil did the coolies matter to anybody? And when he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) came out, the
extremity of the ship made what went on inside of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appear of little
moment.

<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had left the alleyway in the very moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sinking. The bridge ladders had been washed away, but an enormous sea
filling the after-deck floated him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) up. After that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had to lie on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)
stomach for some time, holding to a ring-bolt, getting his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) breath now
and then, and swallowing salt water. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) struggled farther on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hands
and knees, too frightened and distracted to turn back. In this way
he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) reached the after-part of the wheelhouse. In that comparatively
sheltered spot he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) found the second mate.

<p/>The boatswain was pleasantly surprised--his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) impression being that
everybody on deck must have been washed away a long time ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) asked
eagerly where the Captain was.

<p/>The second mate was lying low, like a malignant little animal under a
hedge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain? Gone overboard, after getting us into this mess.''  (<font color='red'><b>The mate</b></font>)</div>The mate,
too, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) knew or cared. Another fool. Didn't matter. Everybody
was going by-and-by.

<p/>The boatswain crawled out again into the strength of the wind; not
because he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) much expected to find anybody, he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) said, but just to get away
from <div class="bookquote">``that man.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) crawled out as outcasts go to face an inclement
world. Hence his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) great joy at finding Jukes and the Captain. But what
was going on in the `tween-deck was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) a minor matter by that time.
Besides, it was difficult to make yourself heard. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) managed to
convey the idea that the Chinaman had broken adrift together with their
boxes, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had come up on purpose to report this. As to the
hands, they were all right. Then, appeased, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) subsided on the deck in
a sitting posture, hugging with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arms and legs the stand of the
engine-room telegraph--an iron casting as thick as a post. When that
went, why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) expected he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would go, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) gave no more thought to the
coolies.


<p/>Captain MacWhirr had made Jukes understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to go down
below--to see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to do then, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>And the trembling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) whole wet body
caused Jukes' voice to sound like bleating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See first ... Bossn ... says ... adrift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That bossn is a confounded fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>howled Jukes, shakily.

<p/>The absurdity of the demand made upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) revolted Jukes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was as
unwilling to go as if the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had left the deck the ship were sure
to sink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must know ... can't leave...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll settle, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fight ... bossn says they fight... Why? Can't have ...
fighting ... board ship... Much rather keep you here ... case
... I should ... washed overboard myself... Stop it ... some
way. You see and tell me ... through engine-room tube. Don't want you
... come up here ... too often. Dangerous ... moving about ...
deck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes, held with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) head in chancery, had to listen to what seemed
horrible suggestions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't want ... you get lost ... so long ... ship isn't...
Rout ... Good man ... Ship ... may ... through this ... all
right yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>All at once Jukes understood he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) would have to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) may?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) screamed.

<p/>But the wind devoured the reply, out of which Jukes heard only the one
word, pronounced with great energy <div class="bookquote">``... Always...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain MacWhirr released Jukes, and bending over the boatswain, yelled,
<div class="bookquote">``Get back with the mate.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boatswain</b></font>)</div>Jukes only knew that the arm was gone off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) shoulders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was dismissed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) orders--to do what? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was
exasperated into letting go his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) hold carelessly, and on the instant
was blown away. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) that nothing could stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) from being
blown right over the stern. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) flung himself down hastily, and the
boatswain, who was following, fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you get up yet, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boatswain</b></font>)</div>cried the boatswain. <div class="bookquote">``No hurry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A sea swept over. Jukes understood the boatswain to splutter that the
bridge ladders were gone. <div class="bookquote">``I'll lower you down, sir, by your hands,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) screamed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) shouted also something about the smoke-stack being
as likely to go overboard as not. Jukes thought it very possible, and
imagined the fires out, the ship helpless... The boatswain by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
side kept on yelling. <div class="bookquote">``What? What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>Jukes cried distressfully; and
the other repeated, <div class="bookquote">``What would my old woman say if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw me now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>In the alleyway, where a lot of water had got in and splashed in the
dark, the men were still as death, till Jukes stumbled against one of
them and cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) savagely for being in the way. Two or three voices
then asked, eager and weak, <div class="bookquote">``Any chance for us, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with you fools?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said brutally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) felt as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) could throw himself down amongst them and never move any more. But
they seemed cheered; and in the midst of obsequious warnings, <div class="bookquote">``Look
out! Mind that manhole lid, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>they lowered him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) into the bunker. The
boatswain tumbled down after him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>), and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had picked himself
up he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) remarked, ``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would say, `Serve you right, you old fool, for
going to sea.'''

<p/>The boatswain had some means, and made a point of alluding to them
frequently. His (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wife--a fat woman--and two grown-up daughters kept a
greengrocer's shop in the East-end of London.

<p/>In the dark, Jukes, unsteady on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) legs, listened to a faint thunderous
patter. A deadened screaming went on steadily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) elbow, as it were;
and from above the louder tumult of the storm descended upon these near
sounds. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) head swam. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>), too, in that bunker, the motion of the
ship seemed novel and menacing, sapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) resolution as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had
never been afloat before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had half a mind to scramble out again; but the remembrance of Captain
MacWhirr's voice made this impossible. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) orders were to go and see.
What was the good of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wanted to know. Enraged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) told himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
would see--of course. But the boatswain, staggering clumsily, warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
to be careful how he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) opened that door; there was a blamed fight going
on. And Jukes, as if in great bodily pain, desired irritably to know
what the devil they were fighting for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dollars! Dollars, sir. All their rotten chests got burst open. Blamed
money skipping all over the place, and they are tumbling after it head
over heels--tearing and biting like anything. A regular little hell in
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes convulsively opened the door. The short boatswain peered under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
arm.

<p/>One of the lamps had gone out, broken perhaps. Rancorous, guttural cries
burst out loudly on their ears, and a strange panting sound, the working
of all these straining breasts. A hard blow hit the side of the ship:
water fell above with a stunning shock, and in the forefront of the
gloom, where the air was reddish and thick, Jukes saw a head bang the
deck violently, two thick calves waving on high, muscular arms twined
round a naked body, a yellow-face, open-mouthed and with a set wild
stare, look up and slide away. An empty chest clattered turning over;
a man fell head first with a jump, as if lifted by a kick; and farther
off, indistinct, others streamed like a mass of rolling stones down
a bank, thumping the deck with their feet and flourishing their arms
wildly. The hatchway ladder was loaded with coolies swarming on it
like bees on a branch. They hung on the steps in a crawling, stirring
cluster, beating madly with their fists the underside of the battened
hatch, and the headlong rush of the water above was heard in the
intervals of their yelling. The ship heeled over more, and they began
to drop off: first one, then two, then all the rest went away together,
falling straight off with a great cry.

<p/>Jukes was confounded. The boatswain, with gruff anxiety, begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you go in there, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The whole place seemed to twist upon itself, jumping incessantly the
while; and when the ship rose to a sea Jukes fancied that all these men
would be shot upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) in a body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) backed out, swung the door to, and
with trembling hands pushed at the bolt...

<p/>As soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) mate had gone Captain MacWhirr, left alone on the bridge,
sidled and staggered as far as the wheelhouse. Its door being hinged
forward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had to fight the gale for admittance, and when at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
managed to enter, it was with an instantaneous clatter and a bang, as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had been fired through the wood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) stood within, holding on
to the handle.

<p/>The steering-gear leaked steam, and in the confined space the glass of
the binnacle made a shiny oval of light in a thin white fog. The wind
howled, hummed, whistled, with sudden booming gusts that rattled
the doors and shutters in the vicious patter of sprays. Two coils of
lead-line and a small canvas bag hung on a long lanyard, swung wide off,
and came back clinging to the bulkheads. The gratings underfoot were
nearly afloat; with every sweeping blow of a sea, water squirted
violently through the cracks all round the door, and the man at the
helm had flung down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cap, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat, and stood propped against the
gear-casing in a striped cotton shirt open on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast. The little
brass wheel in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands had the appearance of a bright and fragile
toy. The cords of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck stood hard and lean, a dark patch lay in the
hollow of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was still and sunken as in death.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes. The sea that had nearly taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
overboard had, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) great annoyance, washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sou'-wester hat off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) bald head. The fluffy, fair hair, soaked and darkened, resembled a
mean skein of cotton threads festooned round his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) bare skull. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) face,
glistening with sea-water, had been made crimson with the wind, with
the sting of sprays. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had come off sweating from
before a furnace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) muttered, heavily.

<p/>The second mate had found his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) way into the wheelhouse some time before.
He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) had fixed himself in a corner with his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) knees up, a fist pressed
against each temple; and this attitude suggested rage, sorrow,
resignation, surrender, with a sort of concentrated unforgiveness. He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>)
said mournfully and defiantly, <div class="bookquote">``Well, it's my watch below now: ain't
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>The steam gear clattered, stopped, clattered again; and the helmsman's
eyeballs seemed to project out of a hungry face as if the compass card
behind the binnacle glass had been meat. God knows how long he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been
left there to steer, as if forgotten by all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shipmates. The bells had
not been struck; there had been no reliefs; the ship's routine had gone
down wind; but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was trying to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head north-north-east. The
rudder might have been gone for all he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew, the fires out, the engines
broken down, the ship ready to roll over like a corpse. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was
anxious not to get muddled and lose control of her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head, because the
compass-card swung far both ways, wriggling on the pivot, and sometimes
seemed to whirl right round. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) suffered from mental stress. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was
horribly afraid, also, of the wheelhouse going. Mountains of water kept
on tumbling against it. When the ship took one of her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) desperate dives
the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lips twitched.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr looked up at the wheelhouse clock. Screwed to the
bulk-head, it had a white face on which the black hands appeared to
stand quite still. It was half-past one in the morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) muttered to himself.

<p/>The second mate heard him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>), and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) head as one grieving amongst
ruins, <div class="bookquote">``You won't see it break,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) exclaimed. His (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) wrists and his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) knees
could be seen to shake violently. <div class="bookquote">``No, by God! You won't...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) face again between his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) fists.

<p/>The body of the helmsman had moved slightly, but his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) head didn't budge
on his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) neck,--like a stone head fixed to look one way from a column.
During a roll that all but took his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) booted legs from under him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>), and
in the very stagger to save himself, Captain MacWhirr said austerely,
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you pay any attention to what that man says.''  (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div>And then, with an
indefinable change of tone, very grave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) isn't on duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The sailor said nothing.

<p/>The hurricane boomed, shaking the little place, which seemed air-tight;
and the light of the binnacle flickered all the time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't been relieved,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Captain MacWhirr went on, looking down. <div class="bookquote">``I
want you to stick to the helm, though, as long as you can. You've
got the hang of her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). Another man coming here might make a mess of it.
Wouldn't do. No child's play. And the hands are probably busy with a job
down below... Think you can?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The steering-gear leaped into an abrupt short clatter, stopped
smouldering like an ember; and the still man, with a motionless gaze,
burst out, as if all the passion in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips: <div class="bookquote">``By
Heavens, sir! I can steer for ever if nobody talks to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! aye! All right...''  (<font color='red'><b>The Captain</b></font>)</div>The Captain lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes for the first
time to the man, <div class="bookquote">``... Hackett.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man Hackett</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) seemed to dismiss this matter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) stooped to the
engine-room speaking-tube, blew in, and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head. Mr. Rout below
answered, and at once Captain MacWhirr put his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) lips to the mouthpiece.

<p/>With the uproar of the gale around him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) applied alternately his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) lips
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ear, and the engineer's voice mounted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), harsh and as if
out of the heat of an engagement. One of the stokers was disabled,
the others had given in, the second engineer and the donkey-man were
firing-up. The third engineer was standing by the steam-valve. The
engines were being tended by hand. How was it above?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad enough. It mostly rests with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain MacWhirr. Was the
mate down there yet? No? Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would be presently. Would Mr. Rout
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) talk through the speaking-tube?--through the deck speaking-tube,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>)--the Captain--was going out again on the bridge directly.
There was some trouble amongst the Chinamen. They were fighting, it
seemed. Couldn't allow fighting anyhow...

<p/>Mr. Rout had gone away, and Captain MacWhirr could feel against his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ear
the pulsation of the engines, like the beat of the ship's heart. Mr.
Rout's voice down there shouted something distantly. The ship pitched
headlong, the pulsation leaped with a hissing tumult, and stopped dead.
Captain MacWhirr's face was impassive, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes were fixed aimlessly
on the crouching shape of the second mate. Again Mr. Rout's voice
cried out in the depths, and the pulsating beats recommenced, with slow
strokes--growing swifter.

<p/>Mr. Rout had returned to the tube. <div class="bookquote">``It don't matter much what they do,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) said, hastily; and then, with irritation, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) takes these dives as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) never meant to come up again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Awful sea,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain's voice from above.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let me drive her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) under,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon</b></font>)</div>barked Solomon Rout up the pipe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dark and rain. Can't see what's coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>uttered the voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Must--keep--her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)--moving--enough to steer--and chance it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it went on to
state distinctly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am doing as much as I dare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are--getting--smashed up--a good deal up here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>proceeded the voice
mildly. <div class="bookquote">``Doing--fairly well--though. Of course, if the wheelhouse should
go...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rout</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Rout, bending an attentive ear, muttered peevishly something under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) breath.

<p/>But the deliberate voice up there became animated to ask: <div class="bookquote">``Jukes turned
up yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then, after a short wait, <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) would bear a hand. I want
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) to be done and come up here in case of anything. To look after the
ship. I am all alone. The second mate's lost...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rout</b></font>)</div>shouted Mr. Rout into the engine-room, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) head away.
Then up the tube he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``Gone overboard?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) ear to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lost his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) nerve,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the voice from above continued in a matter-of-fact
tone. <div class="bookquote">``Damned awkward circumstance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rout</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Rout, listening with bowed neck, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) eyes wide at this.
However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) heard something like the sounds of a scuffle and broken
exclamations coming down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) strained his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) hearing; and all the
time Beale, the third engineer, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) arms uplifted, held between
the palms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) hands the rim of a little black wheel projecting at the
side of a big copper pipe.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) seemed to be poising it above his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) head, as though it were a correct
attitude in some sort of game.

<p/>To steady himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) shoulder against the white bulkhead,
one knee bent, and a sweat-rag tucked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) belt hanging on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) hip.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) smooth cheek was begrimed and flushed, and the coal dust on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>)
eyelids, like the black pencilling of a make-up, enhanced the liquid
brilliance of the whites, giving to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) youthful face something of a
feminine, exotic and fascinating aspect. When the ship pitched he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) would
with hasty movements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) hands screw hard at the little wheel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone crazy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>began the Captain's voice suddenly in the tube. <div class="bookquote">``Rushed at
me... Just now. Had to knock him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) down... This minute. You heard,
Mr. Rout?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rout</b></font>)</div>muttered Mr. Rout. <div class="bookquote">``Look out, Beale!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) shout rang out like the blast of a warning trumpet, between the iron
walls of the engine-room. Painted white, they rose high into the dusk of
the skylight, sloping like a roof; and the whole lofty space resembled
the interior of a monument, divided by floors of iron grating, with
lights flickering at different levels, and a mass of gloom lingering in
the middle, within the columnar stir of machinery under the motionless
swelling of the cylinders. A loud and wild resonance, made up of all the
noises of the hurricane, dwelt in the still warmth of the air. There was
in it the smell of hot metal, of oil, and a slight mist of steam. The
blows of the sea seemed to traverse it in an unringing, stunning shock,
from side to side.

<p/>Gleams, like pale long flames, trembled upon the polish of metal; from
the flooring below the enormous crank-heads emerged in their turns
with a flash of brass and steel--going over; while the connecting-rods,
big-jointed, like skeleton limbs, seemed to thrust them down and pull
them up again with an irresistible precision. And deep in the half-light
other rods dodged deliberately to and fro, crossheads nodded, discs
of metal rubbed smoothly against each other, slow and gentle, in a
commingling of shadows and gleams.

<p/>Sometimes all those powerful and unerring movements would slow down
simultaneously, as if they had been the functions of a living organism,
stricken suddenly by the blight of languor; and Mr. Rout's eyes would
blaze darker in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) long sallow face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) was fighting this fight in a
pair of carpet slippers. A short shiny jacket barely covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) loins,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) white wrists protruded far out of the tight sleeves, as though
the emergency had added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) stature, had lengthened his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) limbs,
augmented his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) pallor, hollowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) moved, climbing high up, disappearing low down, with a restless,
purposeful industry, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) stood still, holding the guard-rail in
front of the starting-gear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) would keep glancing to the right at the
steam-gauge, at the water-gauge, fixed upon the white wall in the light
of a swaying lamp. The mouths of two speaking-tubes gaped stupidly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>)
elbow, and the dial of the engine-room telegraph resembled a clock of
large diameter, bearing on its face curt words instead of figures. The
grouped letters stood out heavily black, around the pivot-head of the
indicator, emphatically symbolic of loud exclamations: AHEAD, ASTERN,
SLOW, Half, STAND BY; and the fat black hand pointed downwards to the
word FULL, which, thus singled out, captured the eye as a sharp cry
secures attention.

<p/>The wood-encased bulk of the low-pressure cylinder, frowning portly from
above, emitted a faint wheeze at every thrust, and except for that
low hiss the engines worked their steel limbs headlong or slow with a
silent, determined smoothness. And all this, the white walls, the moving
steel, the floor plates under Solomon Rout's feet, the floors of
iron grating above his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) head, the dusk and the gleams, uprose and sank
continuously, with one accord, upon the harsh wash of the waves against
the ship's side. The whole loftiness of the place, booming hollow to the
great voice of the wind, swayed at the top like a tree, would go over
bodily, as if borne down this way and that by the tremendous blasts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got to hurry up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rout</b></font>)</div>shouted Mr. Rout, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) saw Jukes
appear in the stokehold doorway.

<p/>Jukes' glance was wandering and tipsy; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) red face was puffy, as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had overslept himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had had an arduous road, and had travelled
over it with immense vivacity, the agitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) mind corresponding
to the exertions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had rushed up out of the bunker,
stumbling in the dark alleyway amongst a lot of bewildered men who, trod
upon, asked <div class="bookquote">``What's up, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>in awed mutters all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>);--down the
stokehold ladder, missing many iron rungs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) hurry, down into a
place deep as a well, black as Tophet, tipping over back and forth like
a see-saw. The water in the bilges thundered at each roll, and lumps of
coal skipped to and fro, from end to end, rattling like an avalanche of
pebbles on a slope of iron.

<p/>Somebody in there moaned with pain, and somebody else could be seen
crouching over what seemed the prone body of a dead man; a lusty voice
blasphemed; and the glow under each fire-door was like a pool of flaming
blood radiating quietly in a velvety blackness.

<p/>A gust of wind struck upon the nape of Jukes' neck and next moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) felt it streaming about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) wet ankles. The stokehold ventilators
hummed: in front of the six fire-doors two wild figures, stripped to the
waist, staggered and stooped, wrestling with two shovels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo! Plenty of draught now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the engineer</b></font>)</div>yelled the second engineer at once, as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) had been all the time looking out for Jukes. The donkeyman,
a dapper little chap with a dazzling fair skin and a tiny, gingery
moustache, worked in a sort of mute transport. They were keeping a full
head of steam, and a profound rumbling, as of an empty furniture van
trotting over a bridge, made a sustained bass to all the other noises of
the place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blowing off all the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>went on yelling the second. With a sound as
of a hundred scoured saucepans, the orifice of a ventilator spat upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) shoulder a sudden gush of salt water, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) volleyed a stream of
curses upon all things on earth including his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) own soul, ripping and
raving, and all the time attending to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) business. With a sharp clash
of metal the ardent pale glare of the fire opened upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) bullet head,
showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) spluttering lips, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) insolent face, and with another clang
closed like the white-hot wink of an iron eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's the blooming ship? Can you tell me? blast my eyes! Under
water--or what? It's coming down here in tons. Are the condemned cowls
gone to Hades? Hey? Don't you know anything--you jolly sailor-man you
... ?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes, after a bewildered moment, had been helped by a roll to dart
through; and as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) eyes took in the comparative vastness, peace
and brilliance of the engine-room, the ship, setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) stern heavily
in the water, sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) charging head down upon Mr. Rout.

<p/>The chief's arm, long like a tentacle, and straightening as if worked
by a spring, went out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>), and deflected his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) rush into a
spin towards the speaking-tubes. At the same time Mr. Rout repeated
earnestly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got to hurry up, whatever it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rout</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes yelled <div class="bookquote">``Are you there, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>and listened. Nothing. Suddenly the
roar of the wind fell straight into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) ear, but presently a small voice
shoved aside the shouting hurricane quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, Jukes?--Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes was ready to talk: it was only time that seemed to be wanting. It
was easy enough to account for everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) could perfectly imagine
the coolies battened down in the reeking `tween-deck, lying sick and
scared between the rows of chests. Then one of these chests--or perhaps
several at once--breaking loose in a roll, knocking out others, sides
splitting, lids flying open, and all these clumsy Chinamen rising up in
a body to save their property. Afterwards every fling of the ship would
hurl that tramping, yelling mob here and there, from side to side, in a
whirl of smashed wood, torn clothing, rolling dollars. A struggle once
started, they would be unable to stop themselves. Nothing could stop
them now except main force. It was a disaster. He (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) had seen it, and that
was all he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) could say. Some of them must be dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) believed. The rest
would go on fighting...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) sent up his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) words, tripping over each other, crowding the narrow
tube. They mounted as if into a silence of an enlightened comprehension
dwelling alone up there with a storm. And Jukes wanted to be dismissed
from the face of that odious trouble intruding on the great need of the
ship.



<p/>V

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) waited. Before his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) eyes the engines turned with slow labour, that in
the moment of going off into a mad fling would stop dead at Mr. Rout's
shout, <div class="bookquote">``Look out, Beale!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rout</b></font>)</div>They paused in an intelligent immobility,
stilled in mid-stroke, a heavy crank arrested on the cant, as if
conscious of danger and the passage of time. Then, with a <div class="bookquote">``Now, then!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div>from the chief, and the sound of a breath expelled through clenched
teeth, they would accomplish the interrupted revolution and begin
another.

<p/>There was the prudent sagacity of wisdom and the deliberation of
enormous strength in their movements. This was their work--this patient
coaxing of a distracted ship over the fury of the waves and into the
very eye of the wind. At times Mr. Rout's chin would sink on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) breast,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) watched them with knitted eyebrows as if lost in thought.

<p/>The voice that kept the hurricane out of Jukes' ear began: <div class="bookquote">``Take the
hands with you ... ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>and left off unexpectedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What could I do with them, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A harsh, abrupt, imperious clang exploded suddenly. The three pairs of
eyes flew up to the telegraph dial to see the hand jump from FULL
to STOP, as if snatched by a devil. And then these three men in the
engineroom had the intimate sensation of a check upon the ship, of a
strange shrinking, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) had gathered herself for a desperate leap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rout</b></font>)</div>bellowed Mr. Rout.

<p/>Nobody--not even Captain MacWhirr, who alone on deck had caught sight of
a white line of foam coming on at such a height that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) couldn't believe
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes--nobody was to know the steepness of that sea and the awful
depth of the hollow the hurricane had scooped out behind the running
wall of water.

<p/>It raced to meet the ship, and, with a pause, as of girding the loins,
the Nan-Shan lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) bows and leaped. The flames in all the lamps
sank, darkening the engine-room. One went out. With a tearing crash and
a swirling, raving tumult, tons of water fell upon the deck, as though
the ship had darted under the foot of a cataract.

<p/>Down there they looked at each other, stunned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Swept from end to end, by God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>bawled Jukes.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) dipped into the hollow straight down, as if going over the edge of
the world. The engine-room toppled forward menacingly, like the inside
of a tower nodding in an earthquake. An awful racket, of iron things
falling, came from the stokehold. She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) hung on this appalling slant long
enough for Beale to drop on his (<font color='blue'><b>Beale</b></font>) hands and knees and begin to crawl as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Beale</b></font>) meant to fly on all fours out of the engine-room, and for Mr. Rout
to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) head slowly, rigid, cavernous, with the lower jaw dropping.
Jukes had shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) eyes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) face in a moment became hopelessly
blank and gentle, like the face of a blind man.

<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) rose slowly, staggering, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) had to lift a mountain
with her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) bows.

<p/>Mr. Rout shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) mouth; Jukes blinked; and little Beale stood up
hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another one like this, and that's the last of her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div>cried the chief.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beale</b></font>) and Jukes looked at each other, and the same thought came into their
heads. The Captain! Everything must have been swept away. Steering-gear
gone--ship like a log. All over directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rout</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Mr. Rout thickly, glaring with enlarged, doubtful
eyes at Jukes, who answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) by an irresolute glance.

<p/>The clang of the telegraph gong soothed them instantly. The black hand
dropped in a flash from STOP to FULL.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, Beale!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rout</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Rout.

<p/>The steam hissed low. The piston-rods slid in and out. Jukes put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
ear to the tube. The voice was ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>). It said: <div class="bookquote">``Pick up all the
money. Bear a hand now. I'll want you up here.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And that was all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>called up Jukes. There was no answer.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) staggered away like a defeated man from the field of battle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had
got, in some way or other, a cut above his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) left eyebrow--a cut to the
bone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was not aware of it in the least: quantities of the China Sea,
large enough to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) neck for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>), had gone over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) head, had
cleaned, washed, and salted that wound. It did not bleed, but only gaped
red; and this gash over the eye, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) dishevelled hair, the disorder of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) clothes, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) the aspect of a man worsted in a fight with fists.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Got to pick up the dollars.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) appealed to Mr. Rout, smiling pitifully
at random.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rout</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Rout, wildly. <div class="bookquote">``Pick up ... ? I don't care.
...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then, quivering in every muscle, but with an exaggeration of
paternal tone, <div class="bookquote">``Go away now, for God's sake. You deck people'll drive
me silly. There's that second mate been going for the old man. Don't you
know? You fellows are going wrong for want of something to do...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words Jukes discovered in himself the beginnings of anger. Want
of something to do--indeed... Full of hot scorn against the
chief, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) turned to go the way he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had come. In the stokehold the plump
donkeyman toiled with his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) shovel mutely, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) tongue had been cut
out; but the second was carrying on like a noisy, undaunted maniac, who
had preserved his (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) skill in the art of stoking under a marine boiler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo, you wandering officer! Hey! Can't you get some of your
slush-slingers to wind up a few of them ashes? I am getting choked with
them here. Curse it! Hallo! Hey! Remember the articles: Sailors and
firemen to assist each other. Hey! Dye hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Jukes was climbing out frantically, and the other, lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) face
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>), howled, <div class="bookquote">``Can't you speak? What are you poking about here for?
What's your game, anyhow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>A frenzy possessed Jukes. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was back amongst the men in the
darkness of the alleyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) felt ready to wring all their necks at the
slightest sign of hanging back. The very thought of it exasperated him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) couldn't hang back. They shouldn't.

<p/>The impetuosity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) came amongst them carried them along. They
had already been excited and startled at all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) comings and goings--by
the fierceness and rapidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) movements; and more felt than seen
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) rushes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) appeared formidable--busied with matters of life and
death that brooked no delay. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) first word he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) heard them drop into
the bunker one after another obediently, with heavy thumps.

<p/>They were not clear as to what would have to be done. <div class="bookquote">``What is it? What
is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they were asking each other. The boatswain tried to explain;
the sounds of a great scuffle surprised them: and the mighty shocks,
reverberating awfully in the black bunker, kept them in mind of their
danger. When the boatswain threw open the door it seemed that an eddy of
the hurricane, stealing through the iron sides of the ship, had set all
these bodies whirling like dust: there came to them a confused uproar,
a tempestuous tumult, a fierce mutter, gusts of screams dying away, and
the tramping of feet mingling with the blows of the sea.

<p/>For a moment they glared amazed, blocking the doorway. Jukes pushed
through them brutally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said nothing, and simply darted in. Another
lot of coolies on the ladder, struggling suicidally to break through the
battened hatch to a swamped deck, fell off as before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) disappeared
under them like a man overtaken by a landslide.

<p/>The boatswain yelled excitedly: <div class="bookquote">``Come along. Get the mate out. He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>)'ll be
trampled to death. Come on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boatswain</b></font>)</div><p/>They charged in, stamping on breasts, on fingers, on faces, catching
their feet in heaps of clothing, kicking broken wood; but before they
could get hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) Jukes emerged waist deep in a multitude of clawing
hands. In the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had been lost to view, all the buttons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
jacket had gone, its back had got split up to the collar, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) waistcoat
had been torn open. The central struggling mass of Chinamen went over to
the roll, dark, indistinct, helpless, with a wild gleam of many eyes in
the dim light of the lamps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone--damn you. I am all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>screeched Jukes. <div class="bookquote">``Drive them
forward. Watch your chance when she (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) pitches. Forward with `em. Drive
them against the bulkhead. Jam `em up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sailors</b></font>)</div><p/>The rush of the sailors into the seething `tween-deck was like a splash
of cold water into a boiling cauldron. The commotion sank for a moment.

<p/>The bulk of Chinamen were locked in such a compact scrimmage that,
linking their arms and aided by an appalling dive of the ship, the
seamen sent it forward in one great shove, like a solid block. Behind
their backs small clusters and loose bodies tumbled from side to side.

<p/>The boatswain performed prodigious feats of strength. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) long arms
open, and each great paw clutching at a stanchion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) stopped the rush
of seven entwined Chinamen rolling like a boulder. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) joints cracked;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and they flew apart. But the carpenter showed the greater
intelligence. Without saying a word to anybody he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) went back into the
alleyway, to fetch several coils of cargo gear he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) had seen there--chain
and rope. With these life-lines were rigged.

<p/>There was really no resistance. The struggle, however it began, had
turned into a scramble of blind panic. If the coolies had started up
after their scattered dollars they were by that time fighting only
for their footing. They took each other by the throat merely to save
themselves from being hurled about. Whoever got a hold anywhere would
kick at the others who caught at his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) legs and hung on, till a roll sent
them flying together across the deck.

<p/>The coming of the white devils was a terror. Had they come to kill? The
individuals torn out of the ruck became very limp in the seamen's hands:
some, dragged aside by the heels, were passive, like dead bodies, with
open, fixed eyes. Here and there a coolie would fall on his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) knees as if
begging for mercy; several, whom the excess of fear made unruly, were
hit with hard fists between the eyes, and cowered; while those who were
hurt submitted to rough handling, blinking rapidly without a plaint.
Faces streamed with blood; there were raw places on the shaven heads,
scratches, bruises, torn wounds, gashes. The broken porcelain out of the
chests was mostly responsible for the latter. Here and there a Chinaman,
wild-eyed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) tail unplaited, nursed a bleeding sole.

<p/>They had been ranged closely, after having been shaken into submission,
cuffed a little to allay excitement, addressed in gruff words of
encouragement that sounded like promises of evil. They sat on the deck
in ghastly, drooping rows, and at the end the carpenter, with two hands
to help him (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>), moved busily from place to place, setting taut and hitching
the life-lines. The boatswain, with one leg and one arm embracing a
stanchion, struggled with a lamp pressed to his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) breast, trying to get
a light, and growling all the time like an industrious gorilla. The
figures of seamen stooped repeatedly, with the movements of gleaners,
and everything was being flung into the bunker: clothing, smashed wood,
broken china, and the dollars, too, gathered up in men's jackets. Now
and then a sailor would stagger towards the doorway with his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) arms full
of rubbish; and dolorous, slanting eyes followed his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) movements.

<p/>With every roll of the ship the long rows of sitting Celestials would
sway forward brokenly, and her (<font color='blue'><b>gorilla</b></font>) headlong dives knocked together the line
of shaven polls from end to end. When the wash of water rolling on the
deck died away for a moment, it seemed to Jukes, yet quivering from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
exertions, that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) mad struggle down there he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had overcome the wind
somehow: that a silence had fallen upon the ship, a silence in which the
sea struck thunderously at her (<font color='blue'><b>gorilla</b></font>) sides.

<p/>Everything had been cleared out of the `tween-deck--all the wreckage,
as the men said. They stood erect and tottering above the level of heads
and drooping shoulders. Here and there a coolie sobbed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) breath.
Where the high light fell, Jukes could see the salient ribs of one, the
yellow, wistful face of another; bowed necks; or would meet a dull stare
directed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was amazed that there had been no corpses; but
the lot of them seemed at their last gasp, and they appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) more
pitiful than if they had been all dead.

<p/>Suddenly one of the coolies began to speak. The light came and went on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) lean, straining face; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) head up like a baying hound. From
the bunker came the sounds of knocking and the tinkle of some dollars
rolling loose; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) arm, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) mouth yawned black, and the
incomprehensible guttural hooting sounds, that did not seem to belong to
a human language, penetrated Jukes with a strange emotion as if a brute
had tried to be eloquent.

<p/>Two more started mouthing what seemed to Jukes fierce denunciations; the
others stirred with grunts and growls. Jukes ordered the hands out of
the `tweendecks hurriedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) left last himself, backing through the
door, while the grunts rose to a loud murmur and hands were extended
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) as after a malefactor. The boatswain shot the bolt, and
remarked uneasily, <div class="bookquote">``Seems as if the wind had dropped, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boatswain</b></font>)</div><p/>The seamen were glad to get back into the alleyway. Secretly each of
them thought that at the last moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) could rush out on deck--and
that was a comfort. There is something horribly repugnant in the idea
of being drowned under a deck. Now they had done with the Chinamen, they
again became conscious of the ship's position.

<p/>Jukes on coming out of the alleyway found himself up to the neck in
the noisy water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) gained the bridge, and discovered he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) could detect
obscure shapes as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) sight had become preternaturally acute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) saw
faint outlines. They recalled not the familiar aspect of the Nan-Shan,
but something remembered--an old dismantled steamer he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had seen years
ago rotting on a mudbank. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) recalled that wreck.

<p/>There was no wind, not a breath, except the faint currents created by
the lurches of the ship. The smoke tossed out of the funnel was settling
down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) deck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) breathed it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) passed forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) felt the
deliberate throb of the engines, and heard small sounds that seemed to
have survived the great uproar: the knocking of broken fittings, the
rapid tumbling of some piece of wreckage on the bridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) perceived
dimly the squat shape of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) captain holding on to a twisted
bridge-rail, motionless and swaying as if rooted to the planks. The
unexpected stillness of the air oppressed Jukes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have done it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thought you would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain MacWhirr.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>murmured Jukes to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wind fell all at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>went on the Captain.

<p/>Jukes burst out: <div class="bookquote">``If you think it was an easy job--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) captain, clinging to the rail, paid no attention. <div class="bookquote">``According to
the books the worst is not over yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If most of them hadn't been half dead with seasickness and fright, not
one of us would have come out of that `tween-deck alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said Jukes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had to do what's fair by them,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>mumbled MacWhirr, stolidly. <div class="bookquote">``You don't
find everything in books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I believe they would have risen on us if I hadn't ordered the
hands out of that pretty quick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>continued Jukes with warmth.

<p/>After the whisper of their shouts, their ordinary tones, so distinct,
rang out very loud to their ears in the amazing stillness of the air. It
seemed to them they were talking in a dark and echoing vault.

<p/>Through a jagged aperture in the dome of clouds the light of a few stars
fell upon the black sea, rising and falling confusedly. Sometimes the
head of a watery cone would topple on board and mingle with the rolling
flurry of foam on the swamped deck; and the Nan-Shan wallowed heavily at
the bottom of a circular cistern of clouds. This ring of dense vapours,
gyrating madly round the calm of the centre, encompassed the ship like
a motionless and unbroken wall of an aspect inconceivably sinister.
Within, the sea, as if agitated by an internal commotion, leaped in
peaked mounds that jostled each other, slapping heavily against her
sides; and a low moaning sound, the infinite plaint of the storm's
fury, came from beyond the limits of the menacing calm. Captain MacWhirr
remained silent, and Jukes' ready ear caught suddenly the faint,
long-drawn roar of some immense wave rushing unseen under that thick
blackness, which made the appalling boundary of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) vision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) started resentfully, <div class="bookquote">``they thought we had caught at the
chance to plunder them. Of course! You said--pick up the money. Easier
said than done. They couldn't tell what was in our heads. We came in,
smash--right into the middle of them. Had to do it by a rush.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As long as it's done ... ,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>mumbled the Captain, without attempting
to look at Jukes. <div class="bookquote">``Had to do what's fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall find yet there's the devil to pay when this is over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said
Jukes, feeling very sore. <div class="bookquote">``Let them only recover a bit, and you'll
see. They will fly at our throats, sir. Don't forget, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) isn't
a British ship now. These brutes know it well, too. The damned Siamese
flag.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are on board, all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>remarked Captain MacWhirr.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The trouble's not over yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>insisted Jukes, prophetically, reeling and
catching on. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)'s a wreck,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) added, faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The trouble's not over yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>assented Captain MacWhirr, half aloud
... <div class="bookquote">``Look out for her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going off the deck, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>asked Jukes, hurriedly, as if the
storm were sure to pounce upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) had been left alone
with the ship.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>), battered and solitary, labouring heavily in a wild scene
of mountainous black waters lit by the gleams of distant worlds. She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>)
moved slowly, breathing into the still core of the hurricane the excess
of her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) strength in a white cloud of steam--and the deep-toned vibration
of the escape was like the defiant trumpeting of a living creature of
the sea impatient for the renewal of the contest. It ceased suddenly.
The still air moaned. Above Jukes' head a few stars shone into a pit
of black vapours. The inky edge of the cloud-disc frowned upon the ship
under the patch of glittering sky. The stars, too, seemed to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>)
intently, as if for the last time, and the cluster of their splendour
sat like a diadem on a lowering brow.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr had gone into the chart-room. There was no light there;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could feel the disorder of that place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) used to live
tidily. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) armchair was upset. The books had tumbled out on the floor:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) scrunched a piece of glass under his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) boot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) groped for the matches,
and found a box on a shelf with a deep ledge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) struck one, and
puckering the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes, held out the little flame towards
the barometer whose glittering top of glass and metals nodded at him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
continuously.

<p/>It stood very low--incredibly low, so low that Captain MacWhirr grunted.
The match went out, and hurriedly he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) extracted another, with thick,
stiff fingers.

<p/>Again a little flame flared up before the nodding glass and metal of the
top. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes looked at it, narrowed with attention, as if expecting
an imperceptible sign. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) grave face he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) resembled a booted and
misshapen pagan burning incense before the oracle of a Joss. There was
no mistake. It was the lowest reading he (<font color='blue'><b>Joss</b></font>) had ever seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joss</b></font>) life.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr emitted a low whistle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) forgot himself till the flame
diminished to a blue spark, burnt his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) fingers and vanished. Perhaps
something had gone wrong with the thing!

<p/>There was an aneroid glass screwed above the couch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) turned that
way, struck another match, and discovered the white face of the other
instrument looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) from the bulkhead, meaningly, not to be
gainsaid, as though the wisdom of men were made unerring by the
indifference of matter. There was no room for doubt now. Captain
MacWhirr pshawed at it, and threw the match down.

<p/>The worst was to come, then--and if the books were right this worst
would be very bad. The experience of the last six hours had enlarged his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
conception of what heavy weather could be like. <div class="bookquote">``It'll be terrific,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
pronounced, mentally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had not consciously looked at anything by the
light of the matches except at the barometer; and yet somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had
seen that his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) water-bottle and the two tumblers had been flung out of
their stand. It seemed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) a more intimate knowledge of the
tossing the ship had gone through. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't have believed it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
thought. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) table had been cleared, too; his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) rulers, his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) pencils,
the inkstand--all the things that had their safe appointed places--they
were gone, as if a mischievous hand had plucked them out one by one
and flung them on the wet floor. The hurricane had broken in upon the
orderly arrangements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) privacy. This had never happened before, and
the feeling of dismay reached the very seat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) composure. And the
worst was to come yet! He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was glad the trouble in the `tween-deck had
been discovered in time. If the ship had to go after all, then, at
least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wouldn't be going to the bottom with a lot of people in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) fighting teeth and claw. That would have been odious. And in that
feeling there was a humane intention and a vague sense of the fitness of
things.

<p/>These instantaneous thoughts were yet in their essence heavy and slow,
partaking of the nature of the man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) extended his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to put back the
matchbox in its corner of the shelf. There were always matches there--by
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) order. The steward had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instructions impressed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long
before. <div class="bookquote">``A box ... just there, see? Not so very full ... where I can
put my hand on it, steward. Might want a light in a hurry. Can't tell on
board ship what you might want in a hurry. Mind, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And of course on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be careful to put it back in its
place scrupulously. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so now, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) removed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand it
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never have occasion to use that
box any more. The vividness of the thought checked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and for an
infinitesimal fraction of a second his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers closed again on the small
object as though it had been the symbol of all these little habits that
chain us to the weary round of life. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) released it at last, and letting
himself fall on the settee, listened for the first sounds of returning
wind.

<p/>Not yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard only the wash of water, the heavy splashes, the dull
shocks of the confused seas boarding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ship from all sides. She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) would
never have a chance to clear her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) decks.

<p/>But the quietude of the air was startlingly tense and unsafe, like a
slender hair holding a sword suspended over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. By this awful
pause the storm penetrated the defences of the man and unsealed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke out in the solitude and the pitch darkness of the cabin,
as if addressing another being awakened within his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't like to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said half aloud.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat unseen, apart from the sea, from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ship, isolated, as if
withdrawn from the very current of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own existence, where such freaks
as talking to himself surely had no place. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) palms reposed on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knees, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) short neck and puffed heavily, surrendering to
a strange sensation of weariness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not enlightened enough to
recognize for the fatigue of mental stress.

<p/>From where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could reach the door of a washstand locker. There
should have been a towel there. There was. Good... He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took it out,
wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and afterwards went on rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wet head. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) towelled
himself with energy in the dark, and then remained motionless with the
towel on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees. A moment passed, of a stillness so profound that
no one could have guessed there was a man sitting in that cabin. Then a
murmur arose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) may come out of it yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>When Captain MacWhirr came out on deck, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did brusquely, as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had suddenly become conscious of having stayed away too long,
the calm had lasted already more than fifteen minutes--long enough to
make itself intolerable even to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) imagination. Jukes, motionless on
the forepart of the bridge, began to speak at once. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) voice, blank and
forced as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) were talking through hard-set teeth, seemed to flow
away on all sides into the darkness, deepening again upon the sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had the wheel relieved. Hackett began to sing out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hackett</b></font>) was done.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hackett</b></font>)'s lying in there alongside the steering-gear with a face like death.
At first I couldn't get anybody to crawl out and relieve the poor devil.
That bossns worse than no good, I always said. Thought I would have
had to go myself and haul out one of them by the neck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>muttered the Captain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) stood watchful by Jukes' side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The second mate's in there, too, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) head. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) hurt, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--crazy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain MacWhirr, curtly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) had a tumble, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had to give him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) a push,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>explained the Captain.

<p/>Jukes gave an impatient sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will come very sudden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain MacWhirr, <div class="bookquote">``and from over there,
I fancy. God only knows though. These books are only good to muddle your
head and make you jumpy. It will be bad, and there's an end. If we only
can steam her (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) round in time to meet it...''

 (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div><p/>A minute passed. Some of the stars winked rapidly and vanished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You left them pretty safe?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>began the Captain abruptly, as though the
silence were unbearable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you thinking of the coolies, sir? I rigged lifelines all ways
across that `tween-deck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you? Good idea, Mr. Jukes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't ... think you cared to ... know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said Jukes--the lurching
of the ship cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) speech as though somebody had been jerking him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
around while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) talked--<div class="bookquote">``how I got on with ... that infernal job. We
did it. And it may not matter in the end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had to do what's fair, for all--they are only Chinamen. Give them the
same chance with ourselves--hang it all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) isn't lost yet. Bad enough
to be shut up below in a gale--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I thought when you gave me the job, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>interjected
Jukes, moodily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--without being battered to pieces,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>pursued Captain MacWhirr with
rising vehemence. <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't let that go on in my ship, if I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>)
hadn't five minutes to live. Couldn't bear it, Mr. Jukes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A hollow echoing noise, like that of a shout rolling in a rocky chasm,
approached the ship and went away again. The last star, blurred,
enlarged, as if returning to the fiery mist of its beginning, struggled
with the colossal depth of blackness hanging over the ship--and went
out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now for it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>muttered Captain MacWhirr. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jukes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The two men were growing indistinct to each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) to go through it and come out on the other side.
That's plain and straight. There's no room for Captain Wilson's
storm-strategy here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) will be smothered and swept again for hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>mumbled the Captain.
<div class="bookquote">``There's not much left by this time above deck for the sea to take
away--unless you or me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Both, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>whispered Jukes, breathlessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are always meeting trouble half way, Jukes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Captain MacWhirr
remonstrated quaintly. <div class="bookquote">``Though it's a fact that the second mate is no
good. Dye hear, Mr. Jukes? You would be left alone if...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain MacWhirr interrupted himself, and Jukes, glancing on all sides,
remained silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you be put out by anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>the Captain continued, mumbling
rather fast. <div class="bookquote">``Keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) facing it. They may say what they like, but the
heaviest seas run with the wind. Facing it--always facing it--that's the
way to get through. You are a young sailor. Face it. That's enough for
any man. Keep a cool head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>said Jukes, with a flutter of the heart.

<p/>In the next few seconds the Captain spoke to the engine-room and got an
answer.

<p/>For some reason Jukes experienced an access of confidence, a sensation
that came from outside like a warm breath, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) feel equal to
every demand. The distant muttering of the darkness stole into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) ears.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) noted it unmoved, out of that sudden belief in himself, as a man safe
in a shirt of mail would watch a point.

<p/>The ship laboured without intermission amongst the black hills of water,
paying with this hard tumbling the price of her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) rumbled in
her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) depths, shaking a white plummet of steam into the night, and
Jukes' thought skimmed like a bird through the engine-room, where Mr.
Rout--good man--was ready. When the rumbling ceased it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
that there was a pause of every sound, a dead pause in which Captain
MacWhirr's voice rang out startlingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that? A puff of wind?'' (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div>--it spoke much louder than Jukes had ever
heard it before--<div class="bookquote">``On the bow. That's right. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) may come out of it yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>The mutter of the winds drew near apace. In the forefront could be
distinguished a drowsy waking plaint passing on, and far off the growth
of a multiple clamour, marching and expanding. There was the throb as
of many drums in it, a vicious rushing note, and like the chant of a
tramping multitude.

<p/>Jukes could no longer see his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) captain distinctly. The darkness was
absolutely piling itself upon the ship. At most he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) made out movements, a
hint of elbows spread out, of a head thrown up.

<p/>Captain MacWhirr was trying to do up the top button of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) oilskin coat
with unwonted haste. The hurricane, with its power to madden the seas,
to sink ships, to uproot trees, to overturn strong walls and dash the
very birds of the air to the ground, had found this taciturn man in
its path, and, doing its utmost, had managed to wring out a few words.
Before the renewed wrath of winds swooped on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ship, Captain MacWhirr
was moved to declare, in a tone of vexation, as it were: <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't
like to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was spared that annoyance.



<p/>VI

<p/>On A bright sunshiny day, with the breeze chasing her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) smoke far ahead,
the Nan-Shan came into Fu-chau. Her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) arrival was at once noticed on
shore, and the seamen in harbour said: <div class="bookquote">``Look! Look at that steamer.
What's that? Siamese--isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>)? Just look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the seamen</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) seemed, indeed, to have been used as a running target for the
secondary batteries of a cruiser. A hail of minor shells could not have
given her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) upper works a more broken, torn, and devastated aspect: and
she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) had about her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) the worn, weary air of ships coming from the far ends
of the world--and indeed with truth, for in her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) short passage she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) had
been very far; sighting, verily, even the coast of the Great Beyond,
whence no ship ever returns to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) crew to the dust of the
earth. She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) was incrusted and gray with salt to the trucks of her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) masts
and to the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) funnel; as though -LRB-as some facetious seaman said-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``the crowd on board had fished her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) out somewhere from the bottom of the
sea and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>) in here for salvage.''  (<font color='red'><b>some seaman</b></font>)</div>And further, excited by the
felicity of his (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) own wit, he (<font color='blue'><b>seaman</b></font>) offered to give five pounds for her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``as she (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>)
stands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) had been quite an hour at rest, a meagre little man, with a
red-tipped nose and a face cast in an angry mould, landed from a sampan
on the quay of the Foreign Concession, and incontinently turned to shake
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist at her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>).

<p/>A tall individual, with legs much too thin for a rotund stomach, and
with watery eyes, strolled up and remarked, <div class="bookquote">``Just left her (<font color='blue'><b>Chinamen</b></font>)--eh? Quick
work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A individual</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a soiled suit of blue flannel with a pair of dirty cricketing
shoes; a dingy gray moustache drooped from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lip, and daylight could
be seen in two places between the rim and the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo! what are you doing here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the ex-second-mate of the
Nan-Shan, shaking hands hurriedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Standing by for a job--chance worth taking--got a quiet hint,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man wheezes</b></font>)</div>explained the man with the broken hat, in jerky, apathetic wheezes.

<p/>The second shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist again at the Nan-Shan. <div class="bookquote">``There's a fellow there
that ain't fit to have the command of a scow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declared, quivering
with passion, while the other looked about listlessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught sight on the quay of a heavy seaman's chest, painted brown
under a fringed sailcloth cover, and lashed with new manila line. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eyed it with awakened interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would talk and raise trouble if it wasn't for that damned Siamese
flag. Nobody to go to--or I would make it hot for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). The fraud! Told
his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) chief engineer--that's another fraud for you--I had lost my nerve.
The greatest lot of ignorant fools that ever sailed the seas. No! You
can't think ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Got your money all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div>inquired his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seedy acquaintance suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Paid me off on board,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div>raged the second mate. ```Get your breakfast
on shore,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mean skunk!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>commented the tall man, vaguely, and passed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``What about having a drink of some sort?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) struck me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mate</b></font>)</div>hissed the second mate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Struck! You don't say?''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man in blue began to bustle about
sympathetically. <div class="bookquote">``Can't possibly talk here. I want to know all about it.
Struck--eh? Let's get a fellow to carry your chest. I know a quiet place
where they have some bottled beer...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jukes/Mr. Jukes</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jukes, who had been scanning the shore through a pair of glasses,
informed the chief engineer afterwards that <div class="bookquote">``our late second mate hasn't
been long in finding a friend. A chap looking uncommonly like a bummer.
I saw them walk away together from the quay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the engineer</b></font>)</div><p/>The hammering and banging of the needful repairs did not disturb
Captain MacWhirr. The steward found in the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wrote, in a tidy
chart-room, passages of such absorbing interest that twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was
nearly caught in the act. But Mrs. MacWhirr, in the drawing-room of the
forty-pound house, stifled a yawn--perhaps out of self-respect--for she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>)
was alone.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) reclined in a plush-bottomed and gilt hammock-chair near a tiled
fireplace, with Japanese fans on the mantel and a glow of coals in the
grate. Lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) glanced wearily here and there into the
many pages. It was not her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) fault they were so prosy, so completely
uninteresting--from <div class="bookquote">``My darling wife''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>at the beginning, to <div class="bookquote">``Your loving
husband''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>at the end. She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) couldn't be really expected to understand all
these ship affairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) was glad, of course, to hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>)
had never asked herself why, precisely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``... They are called typhoons ... The mate did not seem to like it
... Not in books ... Couldn't think of letting it go on...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The paper rustled sharply. <div class="bookquote">``... A calm that lasted more than twenty
minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) read perfunctorily; and the next words her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) thoughtless
eyes caught, on the top of another page, were: <div class="bookquote">``see you and the children
again...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) had a movement of impatience. He (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) was always thinking
of coming home. He (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) had never had such a good salary before. What was the
matter now?

<p/>It did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) to turn back overleaf to look. She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) would have
found it recorded there that between 4 and 6 A. M. on December 25th,
Captain MacWhirr did actually think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ship could not possibly
live another hour in such a sea, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would never see his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wife
and children again. Nobody was to know this -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) letters got mislaid
so quickly-RRB---nobody whatever but the steward, who had been greatly
impressed by that disclosure. So much so, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) tried to give the cook
some idea of the <div class="bookquote">``narrow squeak we all had''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>by saying solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``The old
man himself had a dam' poor opinion of our chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook soldier</b></font>)</div>asked, contemptuously, the cook, an old soldier. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hasn't told you, maybe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did give me a hint to that effect,''  (<font color='red'><b>the steward</b></font>)</div>the steward brazened it
out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along with you! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be coming to tell me next,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>jeered the old
cook, over his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>Mrs. MacWhirr glanced farther, on the alert. <div class="bookquote">``... Do what's fair...
Miserable objects ... Only three, with a broken leg each, and one
... Thought had better keep the matter quiet ... hope to have done
the fair thing...''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) let fall her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) hands. No: there was nothing more about coming home.
Must have been merely expressing a pious wish. Mrs. MacWhirr's mind was
set at ease, and a black marble clock, priced by the local jeweller at
3L. 18s. 6d., had a discreet stealthy tick.

<p/>The door flew open, and a girl in the long-legged, short-frocked period
of existence, flung into the room.

<p/>A lot of colourless, rather lanky hair was scattered over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulders.
Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood still, and directed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pale prying eyes
upon the letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From father,''  (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. MacWhirr. <div class="bookquote">``What have you done with your
ribbon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl put her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) hands up to her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) head and pouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s well,''  (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. MacWhirr languidly. <div class="bookquote">``At least I think so.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never says.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) had a little laugh. The girl's face expressed a
wandering indifference, and Mrs. MacWhirr surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) with fond pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and get your hat,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>) said after a while. <div class="bookquote">``I am going out to do
some shopping. There is a sale at Linom's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how jolly!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>uttered the child, impressively, in unexpectedly grave
vibrating tones, and bounded out of the room.

<p/>It was a fine afternoon, with a gray sky and dry sidewalks. Outside the
draper's Mrs. MacWhirr smiled upon a woman in a black mantle of generous
proportions armoured in jet and crowned with flowers blooming falsely
above a bilious matronly countenance. They broke into a swift little
babble of greetings and exclamations both together, very hurried, as if
the street were ready to yawn open and swallow all that pleasure before
it could be expressed.

<p/>Behind them the high glass doors were kept on the swing. People couldn't
pass, men stood aside waiting patiently, and Lydia was absorbed in
poking the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) parasol between the stone flags. Mrs. MacWhirr
talked rapidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s not coming home yet. Of course it's very sad
to have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) away, but it's such a comfort to know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) keeps so well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>MacWhirr/Mrs. MacWhirr</b></font>)</div>Mrs. MacWhirr drew breath. <div class="bookquote">``The climate there agrees with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>MacWhirr</b></font>)
added, beamingly, as if poor MacWhirr had been away touring in China for
the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) health.

<p/>Neither was the chief engineer coming home yet. Mr. Rout knew too well
the value of a good billet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Solomon says wonders will never cease,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Rout joyously at the
old lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) armchair by the fire. Mr. Rout's mother moved slightly,
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) withered hands lying in black half-mittens on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lap.

<p/>The eyes of the engineer's wife fairly danced on the paper. <div class="bookquote">``That
captain of the ship he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) is in--a rather simple man, you remember,
mother?--has done something rather clever, Solomon says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman meekly, sitting with bowed silvery
head, and that air of inward stillness characteristic of very old
people who seem lost in watching the last flickers of life. <div class="bookquote">``I think I
remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Solomon</b></font>)</div><p/>Solomon Rout, Old Sol, Father Sol, the Chief, <div class="bookquote">``Rout, good man'' (<font color='red'><b>the Chief</b></font>)</div>--Mr.
Rout, the condescending and paternal friend of youth, had been the baby
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) many children--all dead by this time. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) best
as a boy of ten--long before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went away to serve his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) apprenticeship in
some great engineering works in the North. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen so little of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
since, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had gone through so many years, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had now to retrace
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) steps very far back to recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) plainly in the mist of time.
Sometimes it seemed that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter-in-law was talking of some strange
man.

<p/>Mrs. Rout junior was disappointed. <div class="bookquote">``H'm. H'm.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) turned the page. <div class="bookquote">``How
provoking! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't say what it is. Says I couldn't understand how
much there was in it. Fancy! What could it be so very clever? What a
wretched man not to tell us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) read on without further remark soberly, and at last sat looking
into the fire. The chief wrote just a word or two of the typhoon;
but something had moved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to express an increased longing for the
companionship of the jolly woman. <div class="bookquote">``If it hadn't been that mother must be
looked after, I would send you your passage-money to-day. You could set
up a small house out here. I would have a chance to see you sometimes
then. We are not growing younger...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s well, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sighed Mrs. Rout, rousing herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always was a strong healthy boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, placidly.

<p/>But Mr. Jukes' account was really animated and very full. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) friend in
the Western Ocean trade imparted it freely to the other officers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)
liner. <div class="bookquote">``A chap I know writes to me about an extraordinary affair that
happened on board his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) ship in that typhoon--you know--that we read of
in the papers two months ago. It's the funniest thing! Just see for
yourself what he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) says. I'll show you his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There were phrases in it calculated to give the impression of
light-hearted, indomitable resolution. Jukes had written them in good
faith, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) felt thus when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) wrote. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) described with lurid effect
the scenes in the `tween-deck. <div class="bookquote">``... It struck me in a flash that
those confounded Chinamen couldn't tell we weren't a desperate kind of
robbers. `Tisn't good to part the Chinaman from his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) money if he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) is the
stronger party. We need have been desperate indeed to go thieving in
such weather, but what could these beggars know of us? So, without
thinking of it twice, I got the hands away in a jiffy. Our work was
done--that the old man had set his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart on. We cleared out without
staying to inquire how they felt. I am convinced that if they had not
been so unmercifully shaken, and afraid--each individual one of them
--to stand up, we would have been torn to pieces. Oh! It was pretty
complete, I can tell you; and you may run to and fro across the Pond to
the end of time before you find yourself with such a job on your hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After this he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) alluded professionally to the damage done to the ship, and
went on thus:

<p/>``It was when the weather quieted down that the situation became
confoundedly delicate. It wasn't made any better by us having been
lately transferred to the Siamese flag; though the skipper can't see
that it makes any difference--`as long as we are on board'--he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) says.
There are feelings that this man simply hasn't got--and there's an end
of it. You might just as well try to make a bedpost understand. But
apart from this it is an infernally lonely state for a ship to be going
about the China seas with no proper consuls, not even a gunboat of her (<font color='blue'><b>Siamese</b></font>)
own anywhere, nor a body to go to in case of some trouble.

<p/>``My notion was to keep these Johnnies under hatches for another fifteen
hours or so; as we weren't much farther than that from Fu-chau. We would
find there, most likely, some sort of a man-of-war, and once under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Siamese</b></font>) guns we were safe enough; for surely any skipper of a
man-of-war--English, French or Dutch--would see white men through as
far as row on board goes. We could get rid of them and their money
afterwards by delivering them to their Mandarin or Taotai, or whatever
they call these chaps in goggles you see being carried about in
sedan-chairs through their stinking streets.

<p/>``The old man wouldn't see it somehow. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to keep the matter
quiet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got that notion into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and a steam windlass couldn't
drag it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted as little fuss made as possible, for the
sake of the ship's name and for the sake of the owners--`for the sake of
all concerned,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), looking at me very hard.

<p/>``It made me angry hot. Of course you couldn't keep a thing like that
quiet; but the chests had been secured in the usual manner and were safe
enough for any earthly gale, while this had been an altogether fiendish
business I couldn't give you even an idea of.

<p/>``Meantime, I could hardly keep on my feet. None of us had a spell of
any sort for nearly thirty hours, and there the old man sat rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
chin, rubbing the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and so bothered he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't even think
of pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long boots off.

<p/>```I hope, sir,' says I, `you won't be letting them out on deck before we
make ready for them in some shape or other.' Not, mind you, that I felt
very sanguine about controlling these beggars if they meant to take
charge. A trouble with a cargo of Chinamen is no child's play. I was
dam' tired, too. `I wish,' said I, `you would let us throw the whole
lot of these dollars down to them and leave them to fight it out amongst
themselves, while we get a rest.'

<p/>```Now you talk wild, Jukes,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>), looking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) slow way that
makes you ache all over, somehow. `We must plan out something that would
be fair to all parties.'

<p/>``I had no end of work on hand, as you may imagine, so I set the hands
going, and then I thought I would turn in a bit. I hadn't been asleep in
my bunk ten minutes when in rushes the steward and begins to pull at my
leg.

<p/>```For God's sake, Mr. Jukes, come out! Come on deck quick, sir. Oh, do
come out!'

<p/>``The fellow scared all the sense out of me. I didn't know what had
happened: another hurricane--or what. Could hear no wind.

<p/>```The Captain's letting them out. Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is letting them out! Jump on
deck, sir, and save us. The chief engineer has just run below for his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>)
revolver.'

<p/>``That's what I understood the fool to say. However, Father Rout swears
he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) went in there only to get a clean pocket-handkerchief. Anyhow, I made
one jump into my trousers and flew on deck aft. There was certainly a
good deal of noise going on forward of the bridge. Four of the hands
with the bossn were at work abaft. I passed up to them some of the
rifles all the ships on the China coast carry in the cabin, and led them
on the bridge. On the way I ran against Old Sol, looking startled and
sucking at an unlighted cigar.

<p/>```Come along,' I shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>).

<p/>``We charged, the seven of us, up to the chart-room. All was over. There
stood the old man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sea-boots still drawn up to the hips and
in shirt-sleeves--got warm thinking it out, I suppose. Bun Hin's dandy
clerk at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow, as dirty as a sweep, was still green in the face. I
could see directly I was in for something.

<p/>```What the devil are these monkey tricks, Mr. Jukes?' asks the old man,
as angry as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) could be. I tell you frankly it made me lose my
tongue. `For God's sake, Mr. Jukes,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>), `do take away these rifles
from the men. Somebody's sure to get hurt before long if you don't.
Damme, if this ship isn't worse than Bedlam! Look sharp now. I want
you up here to help me and Bun Hin's Chinaman to count that money. You
wouldn't mind lending a hand, too, Mr. Rout, now you are here. The more
of us the better.'

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) had settled it all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rout</b></font>) mind while I was having a snooze. Had we
been an English ship, or only going to land our cargo of coolies in an
English port, like Hong-Kong, for instance, there would have been no
end of inquiries and bother, claims for damages and so on. But these
Chinamen know their officials better than we do.

<p/>``The hatches had been taken off already, and they were all on deck after
a night and a day down below. It made you feel queer to see so many
gaunt, wild faces together. The beggars stared about at the sky, at the
sea, at the ship, as though they had expected the whole thing to have
been blown to pieces. And no wonder! They had had a doing that would
have shaken the soul out of a white man. But then they say a Chinaman
has no soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has, though, something about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that is deuced tough.
There was a fellow -LRB-amongst others of the badly hurt-RRB- who had had his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
eye all but knocked out. It stood out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head the size of half a
hen's egg. This would have laid out a white man on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back for a month:
and yet there was that chap elbowing here and there in the crowd and
talking to the others as if nothing had been the matter. They made a
great hubbub amongst themselves, and whenever the old man showed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
bald head on the foreside of the bridge, they would all leave off jawing
and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from below.

<p/>``It seems that after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made that Bun Hin's
fellow go down and explain to them the only way they could get their
money back. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me afterwards that, all the coolies having worked in
the same place and for the same length of time, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be
doing the fair thing by them as near as possible if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shared all the
cash we had picked up equally among the lot. You couldn't tell one man's
dollars from another's, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, and if you asked each man how much
money he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought on board he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was afraid they would lie, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
find himself a long way short. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was right there. As to giving
up the money to any Chinese official he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) could scare up in Fu-chau, he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>)
said he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) might just as well put the lot in his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) own pocket at once for all
the good it would be to them. I suppose they thought so, too.

<p/>``We finished the distribution before dark. It was rather a sight: the
sea running high, the ship a wreck to look at, these Chinamen staggering
up on the bridge one by one for their share, and the old man still
booted, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shirt-sleeves, busy paying out at the chartroom door,
perspiring like anything, and now and then coming down sharp on myself
or Father Rout about one thing or another not quite to his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) took
the share of those who were disabled himself to them on the No. 2 hatch.
There were three dollars left over, and these went to the three most
damaged coolies, one to each. We turned-to afterwards, and shovelled
out on deck heaps of wet rags, all sorts of fragments of things without
shape, and that you couldn't give a name to, and let them settle the
ownership themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This certainly is coming as near as can be to keeping the thing quiet
for the benefit of all concerned. What's your opinion, you pampered
mail-boat swell? The old chief says that this was plainly the only thing
that could be done. The skipper remarked to me the other day, `There are
things you find nothing about in books.' I think that he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) got out of it
very well for such a stupid man.''
